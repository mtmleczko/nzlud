PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Tarboro, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through June 13, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. William L. Corbett, Town Clerk/Finance Director and Mr. Creighton Brinson, Assistant Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

In such event, the cost of such repair or cleaning or removal shall become a lien upon the abutting property equal to the lien for ad valorem taxes and may thereafter be collected either by suit in the name of the town or by foreclosure of the lien in the same manner and subject to the same rules, regulations, costs, and penalties as provided by law for the foreclosure of the lien on real estate for ad valorem taxes.

APPENDIX A 
CODE OF ETHICS 
FOR THE TARBORO TOWN COUNCIL [3] 
Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Code of Ethics for the Town Council of Tarboro, as adopted by resolution on Sept. 13, 2010. 
Cross reference- Town council, Ch. 2, Art. II. 

Section 1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for the Tarboro Town Council (the "Council") and to help determine what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a Council member's best judgment. 
Section 2. - General Principles Underlying the Code of Ethics. 
(A)  The stability and proper operation of democratic representative government depend upon public confidence in the integrity of the government and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon their elected officials. 
(B)  Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented through proper channels and processes of the governmental structure. 
(C)  Council members must be able to act in a manner that maintains their integrity and independence, yet is responsive to the interests and needs of those they represent. 
(D)  Council members must always remain aware that at various times they play different roles: 
(1)  As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens; 
(2)  As legislators, who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting decisions, ordinances, and resolutions; and 
(3)  As decision-makers, who arrive at fair and impartial quasi-judicial and administrative determinations. 
(E)  Council members must know how to distinguish among these roles, to determine when each role is appropriate, and to act accordingly. 
(F)  Council members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents. Each official must find within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate. 
Section 3. - Obey the Law. 
    Council members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the Council. Council members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do. 
Section 4. - Act with Civility. 
    Council members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow Council members or citizens. To declare that a Council member is behaving unethically because one disagrees with that Council member on a question of policy (and not because of the Council member's behavior) is unfair, dishonest, irresponsible, and itself unethical. 
Section 5. - Maintain Integrity and Independence. 
    Council members should act with integrity and independence from improper influence as they exercise the duties of their office. Characteristics and behaviors consistent with this standard include the following: 
(A)  Adhering firmly to a code of sound values; 
(B)  Behaving consistently and with respect toward everyone with whom they interact; 
(C)  Exhibiting trustworthiness; 
(D)  Living as if they are on duty as elected officials regardless of where they are or what they [are] doing; 
(E)  Using their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it, presenting their opinions to all in a reasonable, forthright, consistent manner; 
(F)  Remaining incorruptible, self-governing, and unaffected by improper influence while at the same time being able to consider the opinions and ideas of others; 
(G)  In a quasi-judicial matter, disclosing contacts and information about issues that they receive outside of public meetings to the extent required by law; 
(H)  In a quasi-judicial matter, refraining from seeking or receiving information about the matter outside of the quasi-judicial proceeding itself to the extent required by law; 
(I)  Treating other Council members and the public with respect and honoring the opinions of others even when the Council members disagree with those opinions; 
(J)  Not reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard; 
(K)  Showing respect for their office and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on those in office; 
(L)  Recognizing that they are part of a larger group and acting accordingly; and 
(M)  Recognizing that individual Council members are not generally allowed to act on behalf of the Council but may only do so if the Council specifically authorizes it, and that the Council must take official action as a body. 
Section 6. - Avoid Impropriety. 
(A)  Council members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties. Their official actions should be above reproach. Although opinions may vary about what behavior is inappropriate, this Council will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable person who is aware of all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the Council member's action would conclude that the action was inappropriate. 
(B)  If a Council member believes that his or her actions, while legal and ethical, may be misunderstood, the member should seek the advice of the Town's attorney and should consider publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it (such as consulting with the attorney). 
Section 7. - Faithfully Perform the Duties of Office. 
    Council members should faithfully perform the duties of their office. They should act as especially responsible citizens whom others can trust and respect. They should set a good example for others in the community, keeping in mind that trust and respect must continually be earned. Council members should faithfully attend and prepare for meetings. They should carefully analyze all credible information properly submitted to them, and in quasi-judicial matters they should be mindful of the need not to engage in communications outside of meetings. They should demand full accountability from those over whom the Council has authority. Council members should be willing to bear their fair share of the Council's workload. To the extent appropriate, they should be willing to put the Council's interests ahead of their own. 
Section 8. - Conduct the Business of Government in an Open and Public Manner. 
    Council members should conduct the affairs of the Council in an open and public manner. They should comply with all applicable laws governing open meetings and public records, recognizing that doing so is an important way to be worthy of the public's trust. They should remember when they meet that they are conducting the public's business. They should also remember that local government records belong to the public and not to Council members or their employees. In order to ensure strict compliance with the laws concerning openness, Council members should make clear that an environment of transparency and candor is to be maintained at all times in the governmental unit. They should prohibit unjustified delay in fulfilling public records requests. They should take deliberate steps to make certain that any closed sessions held by the Council are lawfully conducted and that such sessions do not stray from the purposes for which they are called.

Sec. 4.5-53. - Initial review of basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. Upon the adoption of this article and the certification of the town by the FCC, the town shall immediately notify all cable operators in the town, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the town intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the town, a cable operator shall file with the town its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the town council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the town council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town. 
(2)  If the town council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the town council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the town council shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days, if the town Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days, if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the town council has not made a decision within the ninety- or one-hundred-fifty-day period, the town council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the town council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the town clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the public hearing is held. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the town clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the town council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the town council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10) percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The town council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The town council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark, or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus ten (10) percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the town council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the town council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the town council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the town council determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the town council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) above, as applicable. In addition, the town council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the town council's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the town council must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a newspaper published in the town. 
(j)  Appeal. The town council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 93-18, § 2, 11-8-93; Ord. No. 93-19, §§ 4, 5, 12-13-93) 
Sec. 4.5-54. - Review of request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the town who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the town and notify all subscribers at least thirty (30) days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one (1) year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the town council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the town council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the town. 
(2)  If the town council takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the town, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the town council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the town council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days, if the town council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days, if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the town council has not made a decision within the ninety- or one-hundred-fifty-day period, the town council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the town council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may request the town clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the public hearing is held. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the town clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the town council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the town council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the town council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the town council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the town council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the town council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The town council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then-current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The town council's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the town clerk to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The town council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments, with interest, if: 
a.  The town council was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in subsection (c) above; 
b.  The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The town council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the town council disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the town council's decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The town council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 93-18, § 3, 11-8-93; Ord. No. 93-19, §§ 4, 6, 12-13-93) 
Sec. 4.5-55. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  Required by town. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the town council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the town council may request additional information in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the town council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  Town council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) will be acted upon by the town council. The town council will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the town council denies the request, the town council shall take one (1) of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the town, the operator may request that the town return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the town will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the town council, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the town council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five (5) working days of the town council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. No. 93-18, § 4, 11-8-93; Ord. No. 93-19, § 4, 12-13-93) 
Sec. 4.5-56. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the town in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The town shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the town makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 93-18, § 5, 11-8-93; Ord. No. 93-19, § 4, 12-13-93) 
Sec. 4.5-57. - Enforcement and administration. 
(a)  Refunds. The town may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the town. 
(b)  Penalty. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day the cable operator fails to comply. 
(c)  Injunctive relief. In addition to the remedies of subsections (a) and (b), this article may be enforced through equitable relief, the filing of petitions or complaints with FCC, or any other applicable civil remedy available to the town. 
(d)  Administration. The town manager is authorized to execute on behalf of the town, and file with the FCC, such forms or other instruments as are now or hereafter required or permitted by the FCC rate regulations in order for the town to regulate basic service rates and charges. 
(e)  [Regulation in accordance with FCC.] Notwithstanding any different or inconsistent provisions in the cable franchise ordinance (Ordinance No. 90-32) of the town, or the franchise granted to any franchise holder by the town, the town will follow the FCC rate regulations in its regulation of the basic service rates and charges under this article.

a.  If, on the date the council considers such ordinance, the council concludes that the owner has still failed either to (i) repair, alter or improve the dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit, or (ii) demolish or remove the dwelling or dwelling unit, the council may adopt an ordinance in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. 
b.  The ordinance shall identify the property and the owner and shall direct the inspector to repair or vacate and close or to demolish or remove the dwelling or dwelling unit unless (i) the owner has, prior to the adoption of such ordinance, entered into an agreement with the town (as described in subsection (c)(2)c. below) staying enforcement of the provisions of this article, or enters such an agreement within ten days after the adoption of such ordinance.

d.  If the inspector determines that a property owner who has entered into an agreement staying the enforcement of the minimum housing code has failed to complete at least twenty-five (25) percent of the total cost of the work described in the agreement within fifty (50) percent of the time established in the agreement for the completion of all the work, then the inspector shall so notify the property owner in writing and shall, not less than ten (10) days after the date of such notice, proceed to enforce the repair, vacate and close or demolition/removal order. If the inspector determines that the property owner has met the foregoing threshold of completion, then the repair, vacate and close or demolition/removal order shall not be enforced. However, upon expiration of the agreement, if the property owner has still not brought the dwelling or dwelling unit up to the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, then the inspector shall invoke the provisions of section 9-48 to obtain compliance with the requirements of this article, including the levying of daily civil penalties.

When an appeal is from a decision of the inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one (1) day's written notice to the inspector, by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. section 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. 
(1)  The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the inspector, but the concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, if there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

(1)  With respect to enforcement proceedings that have been initiated prior to June 19, 2006, but for which the council has not yet adopted an ordinance directing the demolition of the dwelling, the inspector shall, if an order has been issued under subsection 9-41(b) of the existing code establishing a shorter compliance period than the sixty-day time period in subsection 9-41(b) of the amended ordinance, serve an amended order that is consistent with the new time limits. Except as provided herein, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply to any such enforcement proceedings. 
(2)  With respect to enforcement proceedings that have been initiated prior to June 19, 2006, and for which the council has already adopted an ordinance directing the inspector to demolish a dwelling upon the expiration of a specified period of time if the dwelling has not been brought up to the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, the provisions of such ordinance shall be carried out unless, within ten (10) days after the effective date of this ordinance, the town and the owner of the property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding under this article enter into an agreement staying the enforcement of the minimum housing code pursuant to the provisions of this section. In that event, the provisions of subsection 9-41(c)(2)d. and 9-48(c) of the Code, as amended by this section, shall apply.

(3)  The application contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; or 
(4)  The applicant or person on whose behalf the application is submitted has on prior occasions damaged town facilities and has not paid in full for such damage; or

(7)  The facilities requested are inadequate to accommodate the proposed event and the number of people expected to attend; or 
(8)  The use or activity intended by the applicant would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, other users of the facility, town employees, or the general public; or 
(9)  The event proposed or described by the applicant would be inconsistent with any federal or state statute, town ordinance, or written town policy, including without limitation laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, national origin, age, gender, or disability; or 
(10)  The applicant has on prior occasions made material misrepresentations regarding the nature or scope of an event previously permitted or has violated the terms of a prior permit; or 
(11)  The proposed event will not be limited to the hours of operation of the requested facility as established pursuant to section 12-78, unless the department can accommodate a request for the event to occur outside those hours upon payment by the event sponsor of the costs incurred by the town in making such an accommodation. 
(b)  If the town manager determines that no reason exists under subsection (a) to deny the application, the reservation or permit shall be approved. If the manager determines that the application should be denied for one or more of the reasons set forth in subsection (a), the manager shall inform the applicant wherein the application is deficient, and the reasons therefor. If the deficiency is remedied or the application is revised to meet all the standards of subsection (a), the manager shall approve the requested reservation; otherwise, the application shall be denied.

(Ord. No. 12-03, § 10, 5-14-12) 
Sec. 12-79.5. - Facilities reservation and permit fees. 
(a)  Subject to subsection (d), an application for a reservation under section 12-79 or a permit under section 12-79.1 shall be accompanied by payment of an application fee in an amount specified in or determined in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the town council. An application will not be considered complete and will not be processed unless and until the required application fee is paid. The application fee is designed to cover only the costs incurred by the town in processing the application. 
(b)  Subject to subsections (c) and (d), an application for a reservation under section 12-79 or a permit under section 12-79.1 shall also be accompanied by payment of (i) a user fee, if such a fee has been established for the facility in question in the fee schedule adopted by the council, and (ii) a services and damages deposit, designed to ensure that the town is reimbursed should costs be incurred as a result of services provided to the event or should damages to the facility be sustained as a result of the event. For some facilities, this deposit will be a fixed amount set forth in the fee schedule. When no such fixed amount is established, the town manager shall, after consulting with appropriate town departments, determine the estimated cost that may be incurred by the town to provide services before, during, and after the event. To that amount shall be added a reasonable facilities damage deposit, determined by the manager upon consideration of the nature and size of the requested event and the type of facility where the event will be held. Following the event, if the actual cost of services provided and/or damages incurred is less than the services and damages deposit, the excess amount shall be refunded to the applicant. If the cost of services and damages is greater than the deposit, then the applicant shall promptly reimburse the town upon receipt of a statement from the town itemizing the costs incurred and/or the damages sustained. 
(c)  Subject to subsection (d), an applicant for a reservation under section 12-79 or a permit under section 12-79.1 to hold an expressive event shall not be required to pay a facilities user fee. Nor shall such an applicant be required to pay a services and damages deposit unless the amount of such deposit for the facility in question has been previously established in the fee schedule. However, following the event, the town shall determine the actual costs incurred by the town as a result of damages to the facility resulting directly from the event and directly attributable to the permittee, as well the actual costs incurred by the town in providing services to the event, except that the permittee shall not be required to pay for the cost of public safety personnel who were present to protect event attendees from hostile members of the public or counter-demonstrators or for general law enforcement in the vicinity of the event. The permittee shall promptly reimburse the town upon receipt of a statement from the town itemizing the costs incurred and/or the damages sustained. 
(d)  An applicant for a reservation under section 12-79 or a permit under section 12-79.1 to hold an expressive event shall not be required to pay an application fee or a services fee if the applicant submits with the application an affidavit, on a form provided by the department, stating that neither the applicant as an individual nor any organization, group, or entity represented by the applicant has the financial resources to pay such fees. However, such affidavit shall not relieve the permittee of the responsibility to pay for any damages to the facility resulting directly from the event and directly attributable to the permittee. 
(e)  If an event is cancelled, the applicant or sponsor shall promptly notify the director. No refund shall be made of the application fee. The town shall refund the user fee and services and damages deposit after deducting any costs incurred by the town prior to receiving notification of such cancellation.

(a)  Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, no reservation may be made under section 12-79, and no permit may be issued under section 12-79.1 unless and until the applicant has provided to the town a certificate of insurance stating that the applicant has in effect a comprehensive liability insurance policy covering the event in the minimum amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), which policy must contain an endorsement naming the Town of Tarboro, specifically and separately, as an additional insured. The insurance company must be licensed to do business in the State of North Carolina. The policy or the endorsement must obligate the insurance company to notify the town in writing not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date such policy is terminated or modified if such termination or modification is to occur prior to the indicated expiration date on the face of the certificate. If the policy is cancelled or modified in such a way as to lessen the town's coverage prior to the event, the permit shall be automatically revoked. 
(b)  Subsection (a) shall not apply to expressive events. 
(c)  The town manager may publish a list of recreational facilities whose nature is such that events held in such facilities are unlikely to pose a significant risk of liability for the town or damage to such facilities, and subsection (a) shall not apply to events held in the facilities on that list. Similarly, subsection (a) shall not apply to particular events or categories of events which the manager concludes create no significant exposure to liability for the town or likelihood of damage to town recreational facilities. The manager shall publish a list of any categories of events (e.g. weddings, family reunions, etc.) with respect to which such a determination is made.

The cost of providing such additional equipment and services will be charged to the applicant pursuant to section 12-79.5. 
(b)  It is the applicant's responsibility to deposit any trash into appropriate trash receptacles following the event in order to avoid being charged under section 12-79.5 for the cost incurred by the town of picking up such trash.

For all events (other than expressive events) of four (4) hours duration or more, the town manager may condition the reservation or permit on the applicant making necessary arrangements at its expense to have county EMS medical personnel available on site if the manager concludes that having such medical personnel on site is warranted given the nature of and expected attendance at the event. 
(c)  Utilities. Applicants for reservations or permits for events that will require more than an incidental amount of electricity, or any temporary wiring systems other than a maximum of twenty-five (25) feet of extension cords plugged into existing outlets, or the use of lighting other than from existing fixtures, shall submit with their applications complete information describing their proposed use of electricity and electrical fixtures.

Applicants for reservations or permits for events where sound amplification equipment will be used shall submit with their application information as to the nature and extent of the use of such sound amplification equipment. Pursuant to section 11-18.2 of this Code of Ordinances, outdoor concerts and other amplified sound must conclude by 10:00 p.m.

To this end, the manager will, from time to time, make comparative studies of all factors affecting the level of salary ranges and will recommend to the town council such changes in salary ranges as appear to be pertinent.

Sec. 13-40. - Use of salary ranges.

The following provisions shall govern the granting of within-the-range increases: 
(1)  The minimum rate established for the class is the normal hiring rate for new employees, except in those cases where unusual circumstances appear to warrant appointment at a higher rate. Appointment above the minimum step may be made when the town manager determines that it is necessary in the best interest of the town. Approval will be based on the qualifications of the applicant being in excess of the requirements of the position or that there is a shortage of qualified applicants available at the minimum step or that qualified applicants decline employment at the minimum step. 
(2)  Advancement within the salary range to a higher level of pay shall be at the recommendation of the department head based on the quality of the individual's work performance. The anniversary date shall be the date of employment plus one (1) year.

Hours worked beyond the FLSA-established limit will be paid at the appropriate overtime rate, usually time-and-a-half the employee's regular rate. 
(c)  Wherever practicable, departments will schedule time off on an hour-for-hour basis within the applicable work period for nonexempt employees instead of paying overtime.

(1)  No more than one (1) twelve-week leave may be taken in a twelve-month period, except by permission of the town manager. The inception of that twelve-month period shall begin with the first day of such leave. 
(2)  "Serious medical condition" is defined as an illness, injury, physical impairment or mental condition involving inpatient care in a hospital, residential medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider requiring an absence of more than three (3) days from work, school or other regular daily activities and does not include minor illnesses of short duration. 
(3)  In cases where the need for leave is foreseeable, such as expected birth or planned medical treatment, the employee is required to give the town thirty (30) days' notice or as much notice as is practicable and to make every effort to schedule planned medical treatment in such a manner that the town's operations will not be unduly disrupted. 
(4)  Under some circumstances, leave may be taken intermittently or in blocks of time, or by reducing the employee's normal weekly or daily schedule, when it is medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child or parent) or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work. Use of intermittent leave for birth or placement of a child for foster care or adoption shall be subject to approval by the town manager. 
(5)  The use of accrued sick or vacation leave for purposes of compensation during the leave shall normally be at the option of the employee, who shall notify the town of such election prior to the inception of the leave. The town does, however, reserve the option of requiring the use of accrued vacation or sick leave if it so chooses. 
(6)  An employee who requests leave under the provisions of this section because of his or her medical condition or the medical condition of a family member shall provide verification of medical necessity by the attending physician prior to the inception of the leave and at any other time during the leave, as requested by the town. Such verification shall include the date the condition began; the probable duration of the condition; appropriate medical facts as known by the physician with respect to the condition; and any additional data the town may require if the leave is to be of an intermittent nature. The town may, at its option and expense, require a second medical opinion and, if the second opinion conflicts with that of the attending physician, a third may be required. The third opinion shall be binding both on the employee and the town. 
(7)  All medical, dental and life insurance benefits normally provided by the town for the employees' benefit shall be continued at the town's expense during the course of the leave. Any expenses for optional life, medical or dental insurance which are normally borne by the employee shall be paid by the employee on a scheduled monthly basis. 
(8)  Upon returning from leave, as required by this section, the employee will be restored to his or her job or placed in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits and all other terms and conditions of employment. An employee who is identified as a "key" employee, i.e., one who is salaried and among the highest paid ten (10) percent of all employees, may be denied restoration to employment after return from leave. Such denial can occur only if necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic harm to the operations of the town. 
(9)  The provisions of this section are in no way to be construed in a manner which will deprive the employee of any other privileges or benefits which may be provided for elsewhere.

(Ord. No. 88-34, § 1(19-182), 6-13-88) 
Sec. 13-299. - Procedure. 
(a)  Generally. The following steps shall be followed in all employee grievances except that if the employee alleges sexual harassment, the employee may file the complaint or grievance directly with the personnel director, as set forth in section 13-111 of this Code. All grievances must be in writing and all documents used in the procedure must be dated and signed by the respondent and the recipient. Time limits at every step may be extended by mutual consent. Prior to the first formal step of the grievance procedure, it is required that employee and supervisor meet to discuss the problem and seek to resolve it informally. This meeting should be scheduled by the employee considering filing a grievance with his supervisor within five (5) working days of the incident or action giving rise to the problem. Ongoing conditions are not subject to this deadline. At any stage, the employee may request the assistance of the personnel office in accurately writing the grievance. At each stage, the employee shall sign a copy of the decision or determination to acknowledge receipt and the date of the response. 
(b)  Step 1. If the informal meeting does not resolve the problem, the employee may file a written grievance within five (5) working days of the meeting. Ordinarily, the supervisor will respond, in writing, within five (5) days of receipt of the written grievance. In some cases, the supervisor may feel that a second meeting would be constructive. If so, the supervisor will schedule a meeting with the employee within five (5) working days of receiving the written grievance, will thoroughly investigate the matter and will render a written decision on the grievance within five (5) days of the meeting. The supervisor and division head, if appropriate, should and are encouraged to consult with any town employee or officer they may deem necessary to reach a correct, impartial, fair and equitable determination or decision concerning the grievance. 
(c)  Step 2. If the employee is not satisfied with the Step 1 decision and if the department head was not involved in Step 1, the employee may file an appeal with the department head within five (5) days following receipt of the Step 1 decision.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 17-1. - Economic development investment policy. 
    The Town of Tarboro encourages and supports, within the limitations of the North Carolina General Statutes and financial constraints of the town, the development of the industrial base of the town. Though assistance is normally provided through the provision of infrastructure, such assistance may also be provided through land development, site preparation, building preparation and other means authorized in GS 158-7.1. Consideration in providing infrastructure funding or other direct assistance will be provided only upon the following terms and assurances: 
(1)  Prior to the town's agreement to participate in any industrial development project, it must be established that: 
a.  Within ten (10) years from the date the town and the applicant enter into the agreement specified in paragraph (10), the applicant's investment will increase the town's property tax base by at least five million dollars ($5,000,000.00); and 
b.  Any expenditure incurred by the town for infrastructure improvements that primarily benefit the applicant or for direct contributions to the applicant will, within ten years of the date of such expenditure, be recouped by the town by ad valorem tax revenue increases resulting from increases in the assessed valuation of the applicant's real and personal property caused by the applicant's investment. The calculation determining the assurance will be based on the then current year tax levy computed at one hundred (100) percent. 
(2)  Estimates of valuation of property enhancement must be based on an architect's estimate, contracted construction/development costs, and/or development contracts in hand if third parties are involved. Other forms of proving the level of financial commitment may be considered on an individual basis. 
(3)  All direct assistance to the applicant by the town will be paid in annual installments over a ten-year period and will be prorated based on the amount of each year's taxable property valuation. The annual installment amount shall be limited to fifty (50) percent of the amount of the annual tax revenue. The installment will not be paid until the current year's tax bill has been paid. 
(4)  Actual tax valuations as set by the Edgecombe County Tax Assessor will be used to determine if and when the five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) investment has been reached. Because the taxable valuation of personal property is depreciated over its useful life, the valuation of any personal property used to satisfy the five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) minimum investment requirement must be sufficient in amount to offset the effect of depreciation. At the end of the ten-year period, the combined additional real property value and depreciated personal property value must total at least five million dollars ($5,000,000.00). 
(5)  Projects will be evaluated on no more than ten-year projections. Increased tax revenues beyond the initial ten (10) years will enhance the project's desirability but will not qualify the project for town funding. 
(6)  The facilities of applicants must be located within the corporate limits of the Town of Tarboro or the owner must agree to petition for annexation. 
(7)  Conveyance of land by the town must be valued at an amount equal to the fair market value of the property conveyed. 
(8)  Projects must not be deemed harmful to the environment, require excessive use of water and sewer, create harmful emissions, or be potentially harmful to the surrounding neighborhood as determined by the Town Council of the Town of Tarboro. 
(9)  Applicants shall, on their corporate letterhead, detail the parameters of the request including what the general nature of the manufacturing or industrial process will be, where the site (or sites) is (are) located, how much the real estate and tangible personal property value shall initially represent, and when the facility operation shall begin. Projected daily use of municipal water, anticipated quality and quantity of wastewater, level of electric Kwh usage and electric Kw demand will be provided. The applicant will also indicate that new jobs to be offered will meet average wage levels as set forth in the state enabling laws. The applicant letter, from a corporate official, will be addressed to the Town Manager of the Town of Tarboro. 
(10)  Investment by the town under this policy shall take place only pursuant to a written agreement between the town and the applicant that sets forth the mutual obligations of the parties, establishes a time frame for performance, and spells out the consequences of a failure of performance.

Sec. 20-319. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
    The town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the POTW director. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than ninety (90) days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the town. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 20-315 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 20-311, 20-313 and 20-314 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this division, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and town. 
(Ord. No. 12-11, 9-10-2012) 
Sec. 20-321. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and ninety-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a twenty-four-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

DIVISION 6. - COMPLIANCE MONITORING 

Sec. 20-351. - Monitoring facilities. 
    The town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of the town and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the town. 
(Ord. No. 12-11, 9-10-2012) 
Sec. 20-352. - Inspection and sampling.

Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The town, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the town's, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Ord. No. 12-11, 9-10-2012) 
Sec. 20-353. - Search warrants. 
    If the town, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the town designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the town, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the court having jurisdiction within the town.

Sec. 20-376. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the town by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to section 20-376(d), below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The POTW director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 20-377 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director under this section subject to an administrative appeal under division 10. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The POTW director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or nondischarge permit. Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or, 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
    Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 20-376 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken.

I. - PURPOSE 
    The Town of Tarboro finds that the development of cable television and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the people of Tarboro. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the Town further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the Town or such persons as the Town shall designate. It is the intent of this Ordinance and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
    Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the Town's residents, but also a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve Town agencies and other public institutions, by providing governmental, educational or health care communications. 
    For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained herein: 
A.  Communications services should be provided to the maximum number of Town residents. 
B.  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the Town. 
C.  The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of this system shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible with existing facilities. 
D.  The communications system authorized by this Ordinance shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public. 
E.  Each of the goals enumerated in (a)-(d) above shall be sought taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of Tarboro.

IV. - GRANT OF FRANCHISE 

4.1. - Grant. 
A.  In the event that the Town shall grant to the Grantee a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, and maintain a cable communications system within the Town, said franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable communications system as regulated by the provisions of this Ordinance and the franchise. The franchise shall include by reference those provisions of the Grantee's Application For Franchise that are finally negotiated and accepted by the Town and Grantee. 
B.  The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions contained herein, consistent with the town's Charter and/or other applicable Federal or State statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this Ordinance, the Franchise, or the terms and conditions on which the Town can grant a franchise, the Charter and/or statutory requirements shall control. 
C.  Any franchise granted by the Town is hereby made subject to the general Ordinance provisions of general applicability now in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the Town regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
4.2. - Franchise Area. 
    The Franchise Area shall be the entire Town, or portions thereof, for which a franchise is granted. 
4.3. - Use of Public Rights-of-Way. 
    For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the Town, the Grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public streets and way within the Town such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary to the operation of the cable communications systems; provided, however, that Grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained in this Ordinance, the Franchise Agreement, and other applicable local ordinances. 
4.4. - Use of Town Facilities. 
    At the Town's option, the Town may require a Grantee to utilize Town-owned utility poles for any portion of its cable communications system. The consideration for the use of Town conduit or other facilities shall be in accordance with the Town's regular and then current charges for such use of general applicability. A reasonable fee for the use of Town poles and facilities shall be established in the Pole Agreement. 
4.5. - Use of Grantee Facilities. 
    No poles shall be erected by the Grantee without prior approval of the Town with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole of the Grantee shall be a vested right and such poles shall be removed or modified by the Grantee at its own expense whenever the Town determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The Grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The Town shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the Grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the Cable System operations of the Grantee. 
4.6. - Franchise Required. 
    No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets of the Town or be allowed to operate without a franchise. At the minimum, the Franchise Agreement shall contain representations by the Grantee that: 
A.  It accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this Ordinance, and any supplementary specifications, as to construction, operation or maintenance of the system, which the Town may include in the Franchise Agreement. 
B.  It has examined all of the provisions of this Ordinance and waives any claims that any provisions hereof are unreasonable, arbitrary or void (except where voided by Federal or State laws). 
C.  It recognizes the right of the Town to make reasonable amendments to the Franchise Ordinance or Franchise Agreement during the term of the franchise, provided that no such change shall conflict with the Grantee's rights under this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement (except as authorized by Federal or State laws) or shall compromise the Grantee's ability to perform satisfactorily its obligations or rights under this Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement. It further recognizes and agrees that the Town shall in no way be bound to renew the franchise at the end of any franchise term, except as provided by Section 4.13 of this Ordinance. 
D.  It acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the Town to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the Town pursuant to such power. 
4.7. - Term of Franchise. 
    The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be in the franchise. 
4.8. - Franchise Nonexclusive. 
    The franchise discussed herein is nonexclusive. The Town specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance as it may be amended. 
4.9. - Time is of the Essence to this Agreement. 
    Whenever the Agreement shall set forth any time for any act to be performed by or on behalf of the Grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of the Grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the Town to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the franchise. 
4.10. - Law Governs. 
    In any controversy or dispute under this Ordinance, the law of the State of North Carolina shall apply. 
4.11. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Ordinance or the franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by and Federal, State or Local statute or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
4.12. - Transfer of Ownership or Control. 
A.  Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means without the prior consent of the Town, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and then only under such conditions as the Town may establish. 
B.  The Grantee shall promptly notify the Town of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the Grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the Grantee, directly or indirectly by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of fifteen (15) percent or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or twenty (20) percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interest to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. 
C.  Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the Grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the Town shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the Town may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the Town in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the Town as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
D.  Assumption of control. The Town agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the Town that it or its designees satisfactory to the Town will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one (1) year, unless extended by the Town at its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another Grantee. If the Town finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the Town will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the Town to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
E.  The consent or approval of the Town to any transfer of the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Town in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the Franchise. 
F.  The Town reserves the right to review the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system. Any assignee of the Franchise expressly agrees that any negotiated sale value which the Town deems unreasonable may not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate increases, if applicable, under Federal or State law. 
G.  Any approval by the Town of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the Franchise. 
H.  The Town reserves the right of first purchase in any sale, transfer, lease, assignment or disposal of the system at the system's fair market value. In the event that the Town and Grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the system, the matter will be submitted to arbitration as specified in Section 4.21A of this Ordinance. 
4.13. - Franchise Renewal. 
A.  Renewal discretionary. Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this Ordinance, the Town may in its sole discretion grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the Grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The Grantee shall own the cable communication system, but shall have no property right in the public rights-of-way upon the completion of the franchise term. 
4.14. - Police Powers. 
A.  In accepting the franchise, the Grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the Town to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the Town pursuant to such power. 
B.  Any conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance or the franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the Town's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to Grantee or cable communications systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this Ordinance shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the Town finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by law. 
4.15. - Franchise Fees. 
A.  Because the Town finds that: 
(1)  The streets of the County, State, and Town to be used by the Grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the County, State, and Town at great expense to its taxpayers; and 
(2)  The grant to the Grantee relating to the said streets is a valuable property right without which the Grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and 
(3)  The administration of this Ordinance and the franchise imposes upon the Town additional regulatory responsibility and expense; 
The Grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the Town a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise, but in no event less than five (5) percent of the gross annual revenue, or upon notification by the Grantor the maximum amount permitted under applicable Federal, State, or Local law, if such maximum is greater than five (5) percent. This annual franchise payment shall be in addition to any other fee and commence as of the effective date of the franchise. The Town shall be furnished a statement of said payment by a Certified Public Accountant, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenue and the above charges and computations for the period covered by the payment. 
B.  This payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the Governments or other taxing jurisdiction by the Grantee. Payment of the Franchise Fee made by the Grantee to the Town shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any Federal, State or Local law. 
C.  Acceptance by the town. No acceptance of any payment by the Town shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Town may have for further or additional sums payable as a Franchise Fee under this Ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of the Grantee. 
D.  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, the Grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the Town's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
E.  The Franchise Fee and any other cost or damages assessed shall be payable quarterly to the Town of Tarboro. The Grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the Town during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the Town not later than forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and December. 
F.  The Town shall have the right to inspect the Grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Ordinance. Audits shall be at the expense of the Grantee. Any additional amount due to the Town as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Grantee by the Town which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
4.16. - Forfeiture or Revocation. 
A.  Grounds for Revocation. The Town reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under the Ordinance and the Franchise Grant: 
(1)  If the Grantee shall default in the performance of any of the material obligations under this Ordinance or under such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the Town and the Grantee. 
(2)  If the Grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond and construction bonds as required herein. 
(3)  If the Grantee shall violate any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Grantee relative to this Ordinance or the Franchise, and after notice thereof shall continue the violation and not remedy the same within thirty (30) days. 
(4)  If the Grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this Ordinance or the Franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the Town or cable subscribers. 
(5)  The Grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the Town.

B.  Effect of Circumstances Beyond Control of Grantee. The Grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this Ordinance in any case, in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the Grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the Grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which the Grantee holds a controlling interest whether held directly or indirectly. 
C.  [Performance of Obligations Pending Limitation.] Pending litigation or appeal to any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the Grantee shall not excuse the Grantee from the performance of its obligations under this Ordinance of the Franchise.

D.  Procedure Prior to Revocation. 
(1)  The Town shall make written demand that the Grantee do so comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.

(4)  If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by the Grantee was without just cause, then the Council shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the Grantee shall be terminated and bond forfeited unless there be compliance by the Grantee within ninety (90) days.

F.  Restoration of Property. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the Grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a condition or better than that prevailing prior to the Grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The Town shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after removal.

G.  Restoration by Town; Reimbursement of Costs. In the event of a failure by the Grantee to complete any work required by Sections 4.3 and 4.5 and/or (F) above, or any other work required by Town law or Ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the Town, the Town may cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall reimburse the Town the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the Town may recover such costs through the performance bond provided by Grantee. The Town shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Section. 
H.  Extended Operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, the Town may require the Grantee to continue to operate the system for a period of six (6) months from the date of such expiration or revocation, or until such time as is mutually agreed upon. The Grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable communications system under the terms and condition of this Ordinance and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at the time. The Town shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Section. 
4.17. - Receivership and Foreclosure.

(1)  The Town shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the manner this Ordinance provides; and 
(2)  Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the Town to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise.

The Grantee shall be required to advise the Town of such address(es) and telephone numbers and any change thereof. 
4.20. - Failure of Town to Enforce This Franchise, no Waiver of the Terms Thereof.

4.21. - Rights Reserved to the Grantor. 
A.  Right to Purchase of the System by the Town. 
(1)  Right to Purchase. In the event the Grantee forfeits and the Town terminates the franchise, pursuant to provisions of this Ordinance, or at the normal expiration of the franchise term, absent a franchise renewal, the Town shall have the right, directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the franchised cable communications system. Purchase price shall be based upon the fair market value of the system determined pursuant to this Section. 
(2)  Date of Valuation. The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following the date of expiration or termination and no later than the date the Town makes a fair and reasonable offer for the system or the date of transfer of ownership, whichever occurs first. 
(3)  System Valuation. The fair market value of the cable system shall be determined by a qualified appraiser appointed by the Town. The appraiser shall determine the current worth of the assets based upon what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the assets involved, not including the value of the franchise itself if not renewed, less the value of the goodwill. Under no circumstances shall the value under this Section be less than the book value of the assets less book basis accumulated depreciation. 
(4)  Intent to Purchase. Upon receipt of notice of the Town's intent to purchase the system at the value established above, the Grantee shall have thirty (30) days within which to accept that valuation as the purchase price of the system. In the event that purchase price is not acceptable, the parties shall have one hundred twenty (120) days in which to negotiate an acceptable purchase price. 
(5)  Transfer to Town. Upon exercise of this option, and the payment of the agreed upon sum by the Town and its service of official notice of such action upon the Grantee, the Grantee shall immediately transfer to the Town possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable communications system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the Town in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the Grantee shall execute such warranty, deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the Town as shall be necessary for this purpose.

Notwithstanding the above provisions of this subsection, the Town Council may in its sole discretion waive said bond or reduce the required amount thereof after six and one-half (6 1/2) years of operation of a system under the franchise, by the franchisee, its successors or assigns, which in the sole opinion of the Town Council, has been satisfactory. The waiving of the bond for any particular year shall not prevent the Town Council from reimposing the bond requirement up to the amount authorized in the franchise prior to the annual renewal thereof. Failure to keep a performance bond in force at all times as herein provided and to file with the Town Manager all renewals thereof shall constitute an event default. 
B.  Deposit in Lieu of Bond. In lieu of the performance bond by a surety company as herein provided, the franchisee may file and deposit with the Town a performance bond without a corporate surety but secured by a Certificate of Deposit in some bank or savings and loan association in the Town of Tarboro, North Carolina, in the same amount as the bond conditioned in the same manner as the performance bond of a surety company hereinbefore described. The income from such deposit shall be payable to the franchisee. As an alternative, the franchisee may provide such other security as may be approved by the Town Council, but absent such approval it shall provide a bond or deposit in lieu thereof as above provided.

The bond shall provide that at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of intention not to renew, or of cancellation, or material change be given to the Town by filing the same with the Town Manager. Failure to keep a construction bond in force at all times as herein and in the franchise agreement provided and to file with the Town Manager all renewals thereof shall constitute an event default. 
D.  Conditions. The performance bond shall provide the following conditions. 
(1)  There shall be recoverable by the Town jointly and severally from the principal and surety, any and all fines and liquidated damages due to the Town and any and all damages, losses, costs, and expenses suffered or incurred by the Town resulting from the failure of the Grantee to: faithfully comply with the material provisions of this Ordinance and the Franchise; comply with all orders, permits and directives of any Town agency or body having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults; pay fees due to the Town; pay any claims, liens or taxes due the Town which arise by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system.

Reductions granted or denied upon application by the Grantee shall be without prejudice to the Grantee's subsequent applications or to the Town's right to require the full bond at any time thereafter. However, no application shall be made by the Grantee within one (1) year of any prior application. 
F.  Use of Performance Bond. Prior to filing a claim upon the performance bond for the purposes described in this Section, the Town shall demand that the Grantee perform its obligations, and if Grantee fails to do so within thirty (30) days the Town shall notify the Grantee in writing that payment is due and the Grantee shall have ten (10) days from the receipt of such written notice to make a full and complete payment.

(3)  Not interfere with the free and proper use of public streets, alleys, bridges, easements or other public ways, places or property, except to the minimum extent possible during actual construction or repair; 
(4)  Not interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of private property owners, except to the minimum extent possible during actual construction or repair; and 
(5)  Not obstruct, hinder or interfere with any gas, electric, water or telephone facilities or other utilities located within the Town.

In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the Grantee shall, at its own costs and expense and in a manner approved by the Town, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley disturbed, in as good a condition as, or better than, before said work was commenced and in a good workmanlike, timely manner in accordance with standards for such work by the Town. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no more than ten (10) business days after the damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as possible thereafter.

A.  No poles shall be erected by the Grantee without prior approval of the Town with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole or wireholding structure of the Grantee shall give rise to a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Grantee at its own expense whenever the Town determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
B.  Where poles already exist for use in serving the Town and are available for use by the Grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the Town may require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the Grantee are just and reasonable.

(c)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter [appendix], in acting upon conditional use permit requests or in considering amendments to this chapter [appendix] or the zoning map, the council shall follow the regular, voting, and other requirements as set forth in other provisions of the town code, the town charter, or general law. 
(d)  The town council, in considering the approval of a site specific development plan (as defined in Section 328, Vested Right), shall follow the procedural requirements set forth in Articles IV and VI of this chapter [appendix] for the issuance of a conditional use permit.

ARTICLE IV. - PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL 
PART I. - ZONING, SPECIAL USE, AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS 

Section 46. - Permits Required. 
(a)  Subject to Section 271 (Sign Permits), the use made of property may not be substantially changed (see Section 152); substantial clearing, grading or excavation may not be commenced, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved, or substantially altered except in accordance with and pursuant to one (1) of the following permits: 
(1)  A zoning permit issued by the administrator; 
(2)  A special use permit issued by the planning board; 
(3)  A conditional use permit issued by the town council; 
(4)  An erosion control permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources, if required. 
(b)  Zoning permits, special use permits, conditional use permits and sign permits are issued under this chapter [appendix] only when a review of the application submitted, including the plans contained therein, indicates that the development will comply with the provisions of this chapter [appendix] if completed as proposed. Such plans and applications as are finally approved are incorporated into any permit issued, and except as otherwise provided in Section 64, all development shall occur strictly in accordance with such approved plans and applications. 
(c)  Physical improvements to land to be subdivided may not be commenced except in accordance with a conditional use permit issued by the council for major subdivisions or after final plat approval by the planning director for minor subdivisions (see Part II of this article). 
(d)  A zoning permit, conditional use permit, special use permit, or sign permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant (except that applications submitted by an agent shall be issued in the name of the principal), shall identify the property involved and the proposed use, shall incorporate by reference the plans submitted, and shall contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority. All conditional use permits issued with respect to tracts of land in excess of one (1) acre shall be recorded in the Edgecombe County Registry after execution by the record owner as provided in Section 64. 
(Ord. No. 00-04, § 1, 3-16-00; Ord. No. 00-09, § 9, 5-8-00; Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 47. - No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled. 
    Issuance of a conditional use, special use, or zoning permit authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a change in use of the land or, (subject to obtaining a building permit), to commence work designed to construct, erect, move, or substantially alter buildings or other substantial structures or to make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as provided in Sections 53, 61, and 62, the intended use may not be commenced, no building may be occupied, and in the case of subdivisions, no lots may be sold until all of the requirements of this chapter [appendix] and all additional requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a conditional use or special use permit have been complied with. 
Section 48. - Who May Submit Permit Applications/Submission Requirements. 
(a)  Applications for zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permits or minor subdivision plat approval will be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit or the minor subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, in general this means that applications should be made by the owners or lessees of property, or their agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to acquire the necessary permits under this chapter [appendix], or the agents of such persons (who may make application in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract vendees). 
(b)  The administrator may require an applicant to submit evidence of his authority to submit the application in accordance with Subsection (a) whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this authority. 
(c)  All applications for permits requiring planning board review shall be submitted to the administrator fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date of the planning board meeting at which the permit will be reviewed. If the submission deadline date falls on a Saturday, the application must be received by the preceding Friday. If the submission deadline date falls on a Sunday, the application must be received by the following Monday. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 49. - Applications To Be Complete. 
(a)  All applications for zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permits must be complete before the permit-issuing authority is required to consider the application. 
(b)  An application is complete when it contains all of the information that is necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. 
(c)  The presumption established by this ordinance is that all of the information set forth in Appendix A is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit-issuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular case. For applications submitted to the town council or planning board, the applicant may rely in the first instance on the recommendations of the administrator as to whether more or less information than that set forth in Appendix A should be submitted. 
(d)  The administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional sheets, checklists, or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted. In classes of cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the administrator to determine compliance with this ordinance, such as applications for zoning permits to construct single-family or two-family houses, or applications for sign permits, the administrator shall develop standard forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 50. - Staff Consultation Before Formal Application. 
(a)  To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter [appendix], preapplication consultation between the developer and the planning staff is encouraged or required as provided in this section. 
(b)  Before submitting an application for a conditional use permit authorizing a development that consists of or contains a major subdivision, the developer shall submit to the administrator a sketch plan of such subdivision, drawn approximately to scale (1 inch = 100 feet). The sketch plan shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the developer; 
(2)  The proposed name and location of the subdivision; 
(3)  The boundaries of the tract and the portion of the tract to be subdivided; 
(4)  The approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision; 
(5)  The tentative street and lot arrangement; 
(6)  Topographic lines; 
(7)  A sketch vicinity map showing the location of the subdivision in relation to the neighboring tracts, subdivisions, roads and waterways; 
(8)  The existing and proposed uses of the land within the subdivision and adjoining it, including the streets and lots of adjacent developed or platted tracts; 
(9)  The zoning classification(s) of the tract and of adjacent tracts; 
(10)  Any impact the proposed development will have on endangered habitat; 
(11)  Any impact the proposed development will have on any public water supply watershed or other environmentally sensitive areas; 
(12)  Any other information the developer believes necessary to obtain the informal opinion of the planning staff as to the proposed subdivision's compliance with the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. 
The administrator shall meet with the developer as soon as conveniently possible to review the sketch plan. 
(c)  Before submitting an application for any other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the planning staff concerning the application of this chapter [appendix] to the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93) 
Section 51. - Staff Consultation After Application Submitted. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit, or minor plat approval, the administrator shall review the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that he understands the planning staff's interpretation of the applicable requirements of this chapter [appendix], that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to submit, and that the application represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do. 
(b)  If the application is for a special use or conditional use permit, the administrator shall place the application on the agenda of the appropriate board when the applicant indicates that the application is as complete as he intends to make it. However, as provided in Sections 56 and 57, if the administrator believes that the application is incomplete, he shall recommend to the appropriate board that the application be denied on that basis. 
Section 52. - Zoning Permits. 
(a)  A completed application form for a zoning permit shall be submitted to the administrator by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department. 
(b)  The administrator shall issue the zoning permit unless he finds, after reviewing the application and consulting with the applicant as provided in Section 50, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within his jurisdiction according to the Table of Permissible Uses; or 
(2)  The application is incomplete; or 
(3)  If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one (1) or more requirements of this chapter [appendix] (not including those requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in Article VIII, Nonconforming Situations). 
(c)  If the administrator determines that the development for which a zoning permit is requested will have or may have substantial impact on surrounding properties, he shall, at least ten (10) days before taking final action on the permit request, send a written notice to those persons who have listed for taxation real property, any portion of which is within one hundred (100) feet of the lot that is the subject of the application, informing them that: 
(1)  An application has been filed for a permit authorizing identified property to be used in a specified way; 
(2)  All persons wishing to comment on the application should contact the administrator by a certain date; and 
(3)  Persons wishing to be informed of the outcome of the application should send a written request for such notification to the administrator. 
Section 53. - Authorizing Use or Occupancy Before Completion of Development Under Zoning Permit. 
    In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoning permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance prior to commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the administrator may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this ordinance are concerned) if the permit recipient provides an adequately secured completion bond or other security satisfactory to the administrator in the amount of one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cost of the improvement to ensure that all of the requirements of this ordinance will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve (12) months) determined by the administrator. The bond and security shall be reviewed and approved by the town attorney, however, prior to the administrator authorizing the intended use or occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 98-11, § 1, 11-9-98) 
Section 54. - Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits. 
(a)  An application for a special use permit shall be submitted to the planning board by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department. The review process for a special use permit shall include: 
(1)  Planning department review and recommendation in accordance with Section 56; 
(2)  Public hearing held by the planning board; and 
(3)  Planning board review and action pursuant to Section 59 and 60. 
(b)  An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the council by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department. The review process for a conditional use permit shall include: 
(1)  Development review committee review and recommendation pursuant to Subsection 57(a); 
(2)  Planning board review in accordance with Subsection 57(b) through (e); 
(3)  Town council review and decision on setting a public hearing date pursuant to Subsection 58(a); 
(4)  Public hearing held by the town council; and 
(5)  Town council review and action pursuant to Section 58. 
(c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the planning board or the council, respectively, shall issue the requested permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within its jurisdiction according to the Table of Permissible Uses; or 
(2)  The application is incomplete; or 
(3)  If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one (1) or more requirements of this chapter [appendix] (not including those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in Article VIII, Nonconforming Situations). 
(d)  Even if the permit-issuing board finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this chapter [appendix], it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that if completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not: 
(1)  Will materially endanger the public health or safety; or 
(2)  Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; or 
(3)  Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; or 
(4)  Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the council. 
(e)  No special use nor conditional use permit shall be approved until a public hearing has been held by the permit-issuing board. 
(f)  The town clerk shall publish a notice of the public hearing once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall be published for the first time, not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days, before the date affixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the hearing shall be. The notice required by this section shall: 
(1)  State the date, time, and place of the public hearing; 
(2)  Summarize the nature and character of the permit request; 
(3)  Reasonably identify the property affected by the permit request; 
(4)  State that the full permit request application can be reviewed at the office of the administrator; and 
(5)  State that substantial changes in the permit request may be made following the public hearing. 
(g)  The administrator shall mail written notice of the public hearing to the owners of all properties involved in the permit request as well as the owners of all properties, any portion of which is within one hundred (100) feet of the property involved in the permit request. 
(h)  The administrator shall also post notices of the public hearing in the vicinity of the property involved in the permit request and take any other action deemed by the administrator to be useful or appropriate to give notice of the public hearing on any permit request. 
(i)  The administrator shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this section. However, it is the permit-issuing board's intention that no failure to comply with any of the notice provisions (except those set forth in Subsection (f)) shall render any permit request invalid. 
(j)  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the permit-issuing board may proceed to vote on the permit request, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure. 
(k)  The permit-issuing board is not required to take final action on a permit request within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on permit requests since inordinate delays can result in the applicant incurring unnecessary costs. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 55. - Burden of Presenting Evidence; Burden of Persuasion. 
(a)  The burden of presenting a complete application (as described in Section 49) to the permit-issuing board shall be upon the applicant. However, unless the board informs the applicant at the hearing in what way the application is incomplete and offers the applicant an opportunity to complete the application (either at that meeting or at a continuation hearing), the application shall be presumed to be complete. 
(b)  Once a completed application has been submitted, the burden of presenting evidence to the permit-issuing board sufficient to lead it to conclude that the application should be denied for any reasons stated in Subsection 54(c) shall be upon the party or parties urging this position, unless the information presented by the applicant in his application and at the public hearing is sufficient to justify a reasonable conclusion that a reason exists to so deny the application. 
(c)  The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this chapter [appendix] remains at all times on the applicant. The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the application should be turned down for any of the reasons set forth in Subsection 54(d) rests on the party or parties urging that the requested permit should be denied. 
Section 56. - Recommendations on Special Use Permit Applications. 
(a)  When presented to the planning board at the hearing, the application for a special use permit shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with Section 49 (Application To Be Complete) and the other requirements of this chapter [appendix], as well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the planning board. 
(b)  If the staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with Section 49 or any other requirement of this chapter [appendix], it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions. 
(c)  The planning board may, by general rule applicable to all cases or any class of cases, or on a case by case basis, refer applications to the planning board to obtain its recommendations. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 57. - Recommendations on Conditional Use Permits. 
(a)  Before being presented to the council, an application for a conditional use permit shall be referred to the town development review committee for a recommendation and to the planning board for action in accordance with this section. The council may not hold a public hearing on a conditional use permit application until the planning board has had an opportunity to consider the application pursuant to standard agenda procedures. 
(b)  When presented to the planning board, the application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the development review committee's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with Section 49 and other requirements of this chapter [appendix], as well as any staff review committee recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the council. If the development review committee report proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with Section 49 or any other requirement of this chapter [appendix], it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions. 
(c)  The planning board shall consider the application and the attached development review committee report within sixty (60) days from the initial date the application was reviewed by the planning board. If the planning board fails to act on the application within the sixty-day period, the administrator shall forward the application to the town council. The planning board, at its discretion, may hear from the applicant or members of the public. 
(d)  After reviewing the application, the planning board shall report to the council whether it concurs in whole or in part with the development review committee's proposed findings and conditions, and to the extent there are differences, the planning board shall propose its own recommendations and the reasons therefor. 
(e)  In response to the planning board's recommendations, the applicant may modify his application prior to submission to the council, and the development review committee may likewise revise its recommendations. 
(f)  Following the planning board's review of the application, the permit request shall be placed on the agenda of the town council for consideration. 
(Ord. No. 95-5, § 3, 3-6-95) 
Section 58. - Council Action on Conditional Use Permits. 
(a)  Upon receipt of the planning board's recommendation, the town council shall review the application for a conditional use permit, the planning board's recommendation and the development review committee's recommendation and shall establish a date for a public hearing to be held on the application before the town council. Public notice of the public hearing shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsections 54(f), (g), and (h). 
(b)  Following the public hearing, the town council may proceed to vote on the permit request, refer it to committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure. 
(c)  In considering whether to approve an application for a conditional use permit, the council shall proceed according to the following format: 
(1)  The council shall consider whether the application is complete. If no member moves that the application be found incomplete (specifying either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete) then this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the council that the application is complete. 
(2)  The council shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this chapter [appendix]. If a motion to this effect passes, the council need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a motion fails or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one (1) or more of the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. Such a motion shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. Separate votes may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the council to be unsatisfied through this process. 
(3)  If the council concludes that the application fails to comply with one (1) or more requirements of this chapter [appendix], the application shall be denied. If the council concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for one (1) or more of the reasons set forth in Subsection 54(d). Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. 
Section 59. - Planning Board Action on Special Use Permits. 
    In considering whether to approve an application for a special use permit, the planning board shall proceed in the same manner as the council when considering conditional use permit applications (Section 58), except that the format of the planning board's proceedings will differ as a result of the four-fifths voting requirement set forth in Subsection 32(a). 
(1)  The board shall consider whether the application is complete. If the board concludes that the application is incomplete and the applicant refuses to provide the necessary information, the application shall be denied. A motion to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete. A motion to this effect, concurred in by two (2) members of the board, shall constitute the board's finding on this issue. If a motion to this effect is not made and concurred in by at least two (2) members, this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the board that the application is complete. 
(2)  The board shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this chapter [appendix]. If a motion to this effect passes by the necessary four-fifths vote, the board need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a motion fails to receive the necessary four-fifths vote or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one (1) or more requirements of this chapter [appendix]. Such a motion shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. A separate vote may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application, and the vote of the number of members equal to more than one-fifth ( 1/5 ) of the board membership (excluding vacant seats) in favor of such a motion shall be sufficient to constitute such motion a finding of the board. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the board to be unsatisfied through this process. As provided in Subsection 54(c), if the board concludes that the application fails to meet one (1) or more of the requirements of this chapter [appendix], the application shall be denied. 
(3)  If the board concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for one (1) or more of the reasons set forth in Subsection 54(d). Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. Since such a motion is not in favor of the applicant, it is carried by a simple majority vote. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 04-06, § 1, adopted May 10, 2004, abolished the board of adjustment, therefore, section 59 was amended to read as herein set out. Formerly, such section pertained to board of adjustment action on special use permit. 
Section 60. - Additional Requirements on Special Use and Conditional Use Permits. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b), in granting a special or conditional use permit, the planning board or town council, respectively, may attach to the permit such reasonable requirements in addition to those specified in this chapter [appendix] as will ensure that the development in its proposed location: 
(1)  Will not endanger the public health or safety; 
(2)  Will not injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; 
(3)  Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located; and 
(4)  Will be in conformity with the land use plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the council. 
(b)  The permit-issuing board may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this ordinance unless the development in question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements. 
(c)  Without limiting the foregoing, the permit-issuing board may attach to a permit a condition limiting the permit to a specified duration. 
(d)  All additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit. 
(e)  All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this ordinance. 
(f)  A vote may be taken on application conditions or requirements before consideration of whether the permit should be denied for any of the reasons set forth in Subsections 54(c) or (d). 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 61. - Authorizing Use, Occupancy, or Sale Before Completion of Development Under Special Use or Conditional Use Permits. 
(a)  In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the special use or conditional use permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this chapter [appendix] before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings or selling lots in a subdivision, the permit-issuing board may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings or the sale of subdivision lots (insofar as the requirements of this chapter [appendix] are concerned) if the permit recipient provides an adequately secured completion bond or other security satisfactory to the board in the amount of one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the cost of the improvement to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve (12) months). The proposed completion bond and security shall be reviewed and approved by the town attorney and engineer however, prior to the permit-issuing board authorizing the intended use or occupancy. 
(b)  When the board imposes additional requirements upon the permit recipient in accordance with Section 60, or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install amenities beyond those required by this chapter [appendix], the board may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the property or to occupy any building or to sell any subdivision lots before the additional requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed if it specifies a date by which, or a schedule according to which, such requirements must be met or each amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of any one (1) or more of the following: 
(1)  A completion bond and security satisfactory to the town attorney and engineer is furnished; 
(2)  A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be reviewed when application for renewal is made; 
(3)  The nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient assurance of compliance is given by Section 114 (Penalties and Remedies For Violations) and Section 115 (Permit Revocation). 
(c)  With respect to subdivisions in which the developer is selling only undeveloped lots, the council may authorize final plat approval and the sale of lots before all the requirements of this chapter [appendix] are fulfilled if the subdivider provides a completion bond and security satisfactory to the town attorney to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within not more than twelve (12) months after final plat approval. 
(Ord. No. 98-12, § 1, 11-9-98) 
Section 62. - Completing Developments in Phases. 
(a)  If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this section, then, subject to Subsection (c), the provisions of Section 47 (No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled) and Section 61 (exceptions to Section 47) shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development. 
(b)  As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of Subsection (a), the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this chapter [appendix] that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage. 
(c)  If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one (1) or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit, provided that: 
(1)  If the improvement is one required by this chapter [appendix], then the developer may utilize the provisions of Subsections 61(a) or 61(c); or 
(2)  If the improvement is an amenity not required by this chapter [appendix] or is provided in response to a condition imposed by the board, then the developer may utilize the provisions of Subsection 61(b). 
Section 63. - Expiration of Permits. 
(a)  Zoning permits, special use permits, sign permits and certificates of appropriateness shall expire automatically if, within one (1) year after the issuance of such permits: 
(1)  The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation or similar work is necessary before commencement of such use; or 
(2)  Less than ten (10) percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition or similar work on any development authorized by such permits has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development (see Section 62), this requirement shall apply only to the first phase. 
(b)  If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins, such work is discontinued for a period of one (1) year, then the zoning permit, special use permit, sign permit or certificate of appropriateness authorizing such work shall immediately expire. The expiration of such permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 64. With respect to certificates of appropriateness, if the incomplete work which was subject to the certificate of appropriateness effects an exterior feature of an historically significant structure, then the administrator may, after giving the permittee written notice of intent to do so, seek an order of abatement or other appropriate remedy. 
(c)  The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6) months, the date when a zoning, special use, or sign permit would otherwise expire pursuant to Subsections (a) or (b) if it concludes that the permit has not yet expired, the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six (6) months upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit. 
(d)  For purposes of this section, the special use permit within the jurisdiction of the planning board is issued when such board votes to approve the application and issue the permit. A zoning or sign permit within the jurisdiction of the zoning administrator is issued when the earlier of the following takes place: 
(1)  A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the permit applicant; or 
(2)  The administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the property owner so it can be recorded if required under Subsection 64(b). 
(e)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article VIII (Nonconforming Situations), this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective. 
(f)  Conditional use permits shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period established in accordance with Section 328 (Vested Right). 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04; Ord. No. 09-14, §§ 1, 2, 12-14-09) 
Section 64. - Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns. 
(a)  Zoning, special use, conditional use and sign permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then: 
(1)  No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the permit, except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and 
(2)  The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for, or in connection with, purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in Subsection (b)) of the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest. 
(b)  Whenever a conditional use permit is issued to authorize development on a tract of land in excess of one (1) acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a written acknowledgement that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the Edgecombe County Registry and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor. 
Section 65. - Amendments to and Modifications of Permits. 
(a)  Insignificant deviations from the permit (including approved plans) issued by the town council, the planning board, or the administrator are permissible and the administrator may authorize such insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. 
(b)  Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained without a formal application, public hearing, or payment of any additional fee. For purposes of this section, minor design modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. 
(c)  All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as a modification to the original application. If such requests are to be acted upon by the council or planning board, new conditions may be imposed only on the specific site or area requested to be modified in accordance with Section 60, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his request for an amendment, and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit. 
(d)  The administrator shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth above in Subsections (a), (b), and (c). 
(e)  A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval to the administrator, which request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be given in writing. 
(f)  A vested right established in accordance with Section 328 shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved site specific development plan unless expressly provided for by the town council. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 66. - Reconsideration of Board Action. 
(a)  Whenever the town council disapproves a conditional use permit application, or the planning board disapproves an application for a special use permit or a variance, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not be reconsidered by the respective board at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that: 
(1)  Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed; or 
(2)  New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed with the administrator within the time period for an appeal to superior court (see Section 116). However, such a request does not extend the period within which an appeal must be taken. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the council or planning board may at any time consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously considered. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 67. - Applications to be Processed Expeditiously. 
    Recognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose unnecessary costs on the appellant or applicant, the town shall make every reasonable effort to process appeals and permit applications as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to ensure that all development conforms to the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. 
Section 68. - Maintenance of Common Areas, Improvements, and Facilities. 
    The recipient of any zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit, or his successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements or facilities required by this chapter [appendix] or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements or facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by the appropriate public authority. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines, and recreational facilities must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended, and required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must be replaced if they die or are destroyed. 
    Specific operation and maintenance agreements are required for developments located within watershed overlay districts that utilize the high density development option (see Section 268(c)).

Section 81. - Plat Approval Not Acceptance of Dedication Offers. 
    Approval of a plat does not constitute acceptance by the town of the offer of dedication of any streets, sidewalks, parks or other public facilities shown on a plat. However, the town may accept any such offer of dedication by resolution of the Council or by actually exercising control over and maintaining such facilities. 
Section 82. - Protection Against Defects. 
(a)  Whenever (pursuant to Section 61) occupancy, use or sale is allowed before the completion of all facilities or improvements intended for dedication, then the performance bond or the surety that is posted pursuant to Section 61 shall guarantee that any defects in such improvements or facilities that appear within one (1) year after the dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted shall be corrected by the developer. 
(b)  Whenever all public facilities or improvements intended for dedication are installed before occupancy, use, or sale is authorized, then the developer shall post a performance bond or other sufficient surety to guarantee that he will correct all defects in such facilities or improvements that occur within one (1) year after the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted. 
(c)  An architect or engineer retained by the developer shall certify to the town that all facilities and improvements to be dedicated to the town have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. This certification shall be a condition precedent to acceptance by the town of the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements.

If such defects appear, the guaranty may be enforced regardless of whether the facilities or improvements were constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. 
Section 83. - Maintenance of Dedicated Areas Until Acceptance.

ARTICLE V. - APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS 

Section 91. - Appeals. 
(a)  An appeal from any final order or decision of the administrator may be taken to the planning board by any person aggrieved. An appeal is taken by filing with the town clerk and the planning board a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefore. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the town clerk and the planning board when delivered to the clerk's office, and the date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice by the clerk. 
(b)  An appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days after the date of the decision or order appealed from. 
(c)  Whenever an appeal is filed, the administrator shall forthwith transmit to the planning board all the papers constituting the record relating to the action appealed from. 
(d)  An appeal stays all actions by the administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the administrator certifies to the planning board that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the planning board or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the administrator. 
(e)  The planning board may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

(a)  An application for a variance shall be submitted to the planning board by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department. Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for special use permits in conformity with the provisions of Sections 48, 49, and 56. 
(b)  A variance may be granted by the planning board if it concludes that strict enforcement of the ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of the ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. It may reach these conclusions if it finds that: 
(1)  If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of the ordinance, he can make no reasonable use of his property; 
(2)  The hardship of which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant rather than by neighbors or the general public; 
(3)  The hardship relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal circumstances; 
(4)  The hardship is unique, or nearly so, rather than one shared by many surrounding properties; 
(5)  The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions; and 
(6)  The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation in violation of Article VIII nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land. 
(c)  In granting variances, the planning board may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. 
(d)  A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. 
(e)  The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this chapter [appendix].

(a)  The planning board is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions. If such questions arise in the context of an appeal from a decision of the administrator, they shall be handled as provided in Section 91. 
(b)  An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the planning board by filing a copy of the application with the office of the administrator in the planning department. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the board to make the necessary interpretation. 
(c)  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys, streets, highways, streams, or railroads shall be construed to follow such centerlines; 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, town limits or extraterritorial boundary lines, shall be construed as following such lines, limits or boundaries; 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as following such shorelines; 
(4)  Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map, the boundary shall be determined by measurement, using the scale of the Official Zoning Map; 
(5)  Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or abandonment. 
(d)  Interpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines may be made by the administrator as provided in Section 259. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 95. - Requests to be Heard Expeditiously. 
    As provided in Section 67, the planning board shall hear and decide all appeals, variance requests, and requests for interpretations as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to follow regularly established agenda procedures, provide notice in accordance with Article VI, and obtain the necessary information to make sound decisions. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 96. - Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances. 
(a)  When an appeal is taken to the planning board in accordance with Section 91, the administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the board sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion. 
(b)  The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the planning board to reach the conclusions set forth in Subsection 92(b), as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 97. - Board Action on Appeals and Variances. 
(a)  With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of facts that support the motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not made or fails to receive the majority vote necessary for adoption (see Section 32), then a motion to uphold the decision appealed from shall be in order. This motion is adopted as the board's decision if supported by more than one-fifth ( 1/5 ) of the board's membership (excluding vacant seats). 
(b)  Before granting a variance, the board must take a separate vote and vote affirmatively (by a four-fifths majority, see Section 32) on each of the six (6) required findings stated in Subsection 92(b). Insofar as practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements set forth in Subsection 92(b) shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact supporting such motion. 
(c)  A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one (1) or more of the six (6) criteria set forth in Subsection 92(b) are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the board's decision if supported by more than one-fifth ( 1/5 ) of the board's membership (excluding vacant seats).

ARTICLE VI. - HEARING PROCEDURES FOR APPEALS AND APPLICATIONS 

Section 101. - Hearing Required on Appeals and Applications. 
(a)  Before making a decision on an appeal or an application for a variance, special use permit, or conditional use permit, or a petition from the planning staff to revoke a special use permit or conditional use permit, the planning board or the town council as the case may be, shall hold a hearing on the appeal or application. 
(b)  Subject to Subsection (c), the hearing shall be open to the public and all persons interested in the outcome of the appeal or application shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and arguments and ask questions of persons who testify. 
(c)  The planning board or council may place reasonable and equitable limitations on the presentation of evidence and arguments and the cross examination of witnesses so that the matter at issue may be heard and decided without undue delay. 
(d)  The hearing board may continue the hearing until a subsequent meeting and may keep the hearing open to take additional information up to the point a final decision is made. No further notice of a continued hearing need be published unless a period of six (6) weeks or more elapses between hearing dates. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 102. - Notice of Hearing. 
    The administrator shall give notice of any hearing required by Section 101 as follows: 
(1)  Notice shall be given to the appellant or applicant and any other person who makes a written request for such notice by mailing to such persons a written notice not later than ten (10) days before the hearing. 
(2)  Notice shall be given to neighboring property owners by mailing a written notice not later than ten (10) days before the hearing to those persons who have listed for taxation real property, any portion of which is located within one hundred (100) feet of the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal. Notice shall also be given by prominently posting signs in the vicinity of the property that is the subject of the proposed action. Such signs shall be posted not less than seven (7) days prior to the hearing. 
(3)  In the case of conditional use permits, notice shall be given to other potentially interested persons by publishing a notice in a newspaper having general circulation in the area one (1) time, not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty-five (25) days prior to the hearing. 
(4)  The notice required by this section shall state the date, time and place of the hearing, reasonably identify the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal, and give a brief description of the action requested or proposed. 
Section 103. - Evidence. 
(a)  The provisions of this section apply to all hearings for which a notice is required by Section 101. 
(b)  All persons who intend to present evidence to the permit-issuing board, rather than arguments only, shall be sworn. 
(c)  All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested permit or appeal (crucial findings) shall be based upon reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may crucial findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be particularly reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed. 
Section 104. - Modification of Application at Hearing. 
(a)  In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the town council or planning board, the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications submitted. 
(b)  Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it, the board may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the planning staff. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 105. - Record. 
(a)  A tape recording shall be made of all hearings required by Section 101, and such recordings shall be kept for at least two (2) years. Accurate minutes shall also be kept of all such proceedings, but a transcript need not be made. 
(b)  Whenever practicable, all documentary evidence presented at a hearing as well as all other types of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings and shall be kept by the town for at least two (2) years. 
Section 106. - Written Decision. 
(a)  Any decision made by the planning board or town council regarding an appeal or variance or issuance or revocation of a conditional use permit or special use permit shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant or appellant and all other persons who make a written request for a copy. 
(b)  In addition to a statement of the board's ultimate disposition of the case and any other information deemed appropriate, the written decision shall state the board's findings and conclusions, as well as supporting reasons or facts, whenever this chapter [appendix] requires the same as a prerequisite to taking action.

    The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any situation that is contrary to the requirements of this chapter [appendix], may be held responsible for the violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided. 
Section 113. - Procedures Upon Discovery of Violations. 
(a)  If the administrator finds that any provision of this chapter [appendix] is being violated, he shall send a written notice to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be sent at the administrator's discretion. 
(b)  The final written notice (and the initial written notice may be the final notice) shall state what action the administrator intends to take if the violation is not corrected and shall advise that the administrator's decision or order may be appealed to the planning board in accordance with Section 91. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this chapter [appendix] or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the administrator may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or remedies authorized in Section 114. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 114. - Penalties and Remedies for Violations. 
(a)  Violations of the provisions of this chapter [appendix] or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or special use or conditional use permits, shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day that the violation continues to exist, or a maximum thirty (30) days' imprisonment. 
(b)  Any act constituting a violation of the provisions of this chapter [appendix] or a failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards established in connection with the grants of variances or special use or conditional use permits, shall also subject the offender to a civil penalty in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). If the offender fails to pay this penalty within ten (10) days after being cited for a violation, the penalty may be recovered by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt. A civil penalty may not be appealed to the planning board if the offender was sent a final notice of violation in accordance with Section 113 and did not take an appeal to the planning board within the prescribed time. 
(c)  This chapter [appendix] may also be enforced by any appropriate equitable action. 
(d)  Each day that any violation continues, after notification by the administrator that such violation exists, shall be considered a separate offense for purposes of the penalties and remedies specified in this section.

(Ord. No. 98-10, § 1, 11-9-98; Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 115. - Permit Revocation. 
(a)  A zoning, sign, special use, or conditional use permit may be revoked by the permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this section) if the permit recipient fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements of this chapter [appendix], or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing board. 
(b)  Before a conditional use or special use permit may be revoked, all of the notice and hearing and other requirements of Article VI shall be complied with. The notice shall inform the permit recipient of the alleged grounds for the revocation. 
(1)  The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to authorize the permit-issuing authority to conclude that a permit should be revoked for any of the reasons set forth in Subsection (a) shall be upon the party advocating that position. The burden of persuasion shall also be upon that party. 
(2)  A motion to revoke a permit shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support the motion. 
(c)  Before a zoning or sign permit may be revoked, the administrator shall give the permit recipient ten (10) days' notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the alleged reasons for the revocation and of his right to obtain an informal hearing on the allegations. If the permit is revoked, the administrator shall provide to the permittee a written statement of the decision and the reasons therefor. 
(d)  No person may continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner authorized by any zoning, sign, special use or conditional use permit after such permit has been revoked in accordance with this section.

ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 

Section 121. - Definitions. 
    Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article. 
(1)  Dimensional nonconformity. A nonconforming situation that occurs when the height, size, or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. 
(2)  Effective date of this chapter [appendix]. Whenever this article refers to the effective date of this chapter [appendix], the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this chapter [appendix], if the amendment, rather than this chapter [appendix] as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation. 
(3)  Expenditure. A sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation. The term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures, as well as any other substantial changes in position. 
(4)  Nonconforming lot. A lot existing at the effective date of this chapter [appendix] (and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter [appendix]) that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located. 
(5)  Nonconforming project. Any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this chapter [appendix] and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned. 
(6)  Nonconforming sign. A sign (see Section 270 for definition) that, on the effective date of this chapter [appendix] does not conform to one (1) or more of the regulations set forth in this chapter [appendix], particularly Article XVII, Signs. 
(7)  Nonconforming use. A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located. (For example, a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use.) The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property. (For example, all the activity associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use.) 
(8)  Nonconforming situation. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of this chapter [appendix], an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one (1) or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and set-back requirements) is not in conformity with this chapter [appendix], because signs do not meet the requirements of Article XVII of this chapter [appendix], or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this chapter [appendix]. 
Section 122. - Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completion of Nonconforming Projects. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter [appendix] (e.g., Section 129, Nonconforming Signs), and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections 123 through 128, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter [appendix] may be continued. 
(b)  Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 128. 
Section 123. - Nonconforming Lots. 
(a)  When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in Sections 181 and 183, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use (e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(b)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements (Section 184) cannot reasonably be complied with, then the entity authorized by this chapter [appendix] to issue a permit for the proposed use (the administrator, planning board, or council) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that: 
(1)  The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations; 
(2)  These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(c)  For purposes of Subsection (b), compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(d)  This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with Section 126. 
(e)  Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this section becomes effective, an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one (1) or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if fifty (50) percent or more of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within five hundred (500) feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 124. - Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations. 
(a)  Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in: 
(1)  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
(2)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements. 
(b)  Subject to Subsection (d), a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter [appendix], was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section 128 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(c)  Subject to Section 128 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten (10) percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this chapter [appendix]. 
(d)  The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind, and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur. 
(e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in Section 127 (abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations). 
(f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), whenever there exists a lot with one (1) or more structures on it; and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot; and the parking or loading requirements of Article XVIII that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with Section 298 if parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required, and such satellite parking is reasonably available. If such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional use permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit. 
Section 125. - Repair, Maintenance and Reconstruction. 
(a)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than sixty (60) percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a special use permit issued pursuant to this section. 
(b)  If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a special use permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in Subsection 124(e). 
(c)  For purposes of Subsections (a) and (b): 
(1)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. 
(2)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Subsections (a) or (b) by doing such work incrementally. 
(3)  The "appraised valuation" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser. 
(d)  The planning board shall issue a special use permit authorized by this section if it finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work: 
(1)  There is no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming use; 
(2)  There is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations, or density requirements or other requirements such as parking, loading and landscaping requirements; and 
(3)  There is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
In issuing a special use permit, the board may affix other reasonable and appropriate conditions such as, but not limited to, landscaping and buffering to separate dissimilar uses or to screen parking and loading areas. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 126. - Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists. 
(a)  A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning, special use, or conditional use permit in accordance with Section 46 may not be made except in accordance with Subsections (b) through (d). However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. 
(b)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this chapter [appendix] applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this chapter [appendix] is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status. 
(c)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter [appendix] applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the planning board issues a special use permit authorizing the change. This special use permit may be issued if the planning board finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter [appendix], that: 
(1)  The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 124; and 
(2)  All of the applicable requirements of this chapter [appendix] that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter [appendix] is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created. 
(d)  If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then the change is permissible if the planning board issues a special use permit authorizing the change. The planning board may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other findings that may be required by this chapter [appendix], that: 
(1)  The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit; and 
(2)  All of the conditions applicable to the special use permit authorized in Subsection (c) of this section are satisfied; and 
(3)  The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the special use permit is applied for. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 127. - Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations. 
(a)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes. 
(b)  If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the planning board issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. This special use permit may be issued if the planning board finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained, or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The special use permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected. 
(c)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one (1) apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one hundred eighty (180) days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter, so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(d)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter [appendix] is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this chapter [appendix], the one hundred eighty-day period, for purposes of this section, begins to run on the effective date of this chapter [appendix]. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 128. - Completion of Nonconforming Projects. 
(a)  All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least one hundred eighty (180) days before the effective date of this chapter [appendix] as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten (10) percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this chapter [appendix], may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. In addition, as provided in G.S. Section 160A-385(b), neither this ordinance nor any amendment to it shall, without the consent of the property owner, affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been issued pursuant to G.S. Section 160A-417 prior to the enactment of the ordinance making the change, so long as the building permit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked. 
(b)  Except as provided in Subsection (a), all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this chapter [appendix], and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this chapter [appendix] to issue permits for the type of development proposed. The permit-issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter [appendix], and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the permit-issuing authority shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations: 
(1)  All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building, zoning, sign, or special or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter [appendix] became effective. 
(2)  Except as provided in subdivision (b)(1), no expenditures made more than one hundred eighty (180) days before the effective date of this chapter [appendix] may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter [appendix] became effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure. 
(3)  To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property. 
(4)  To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures. 
(5)  An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project, and the ordinary business practices of the developer. 
(6)  A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him. 
(7)  Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site, the permit-issuing authority may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. The permit-issuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development; and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures. 
(8)  In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the permit-issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages thereof) as originally proposed or approved. Upon proper submission of plans by the applicant, the permit-issuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming. 
(c)  When it appears from the developer's plans, or otherwise, that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under Subsection (b). In addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions (1) through (6) of Subsection (b), the permit-issuing authority shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in addition to other relevant factors: 
(1)  Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural, or engineering work. 
(2)  Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet completed. 
(3)  Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale, in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations. 
(d)  The permit-issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by Subsection (b) that is submitted more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of this chapter [appendix]. The permit-issuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one (1) year. 
(e)  The administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for tax purposes (and developers, if different from the owners) of all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development. This notice shall be sent by certified mail not less than fifteen (15) days before the effective date of this chapter [appendix]. 
(f)  The permit-issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this section. These applications shall be heard, whenever possible, before the effective date of this chapter [appendix], so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted. 
Section 129. - Nonconforming Signs. 
    Signs in existence on the effective date of this ordinance which do not conform to the provisions of this ordinance, but which were constructed, erected, affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs. Although it is not the intent of the ordinance to encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs, nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as follows: 
(1)  No nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign. 
(2)  No nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for periodic change of message. 
(3)  No nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape, size, type or design of the sign. 
(4)  No nonconforming sign shall be re-established after the activity, business or use to which it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed. 
(5)  No nonconforming sign shall be re-established and all remains of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction, if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds fifty (50) percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction. If damaged by less than fifty (50) percent, but repairs are not made within three (3) months of the time such damage occurred, the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be removed. 
(6)  No nonconforming sign shall be relocated. 
(7)  Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is permitted providing the shape, size, type or design of the sign is not altered. 
    Signs located on premises which come within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of Tarboro after the effective date of this ordinance and which signs do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance shall be subject to the requirements listed above. 
    Any nonconforming sign which is structurally altered, relocated or replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this ordinance. 
    Signs in existence on the effective date of this ordinance which do not comply with provisions regulating use of strobe lights, zip lights, flashing lights or rotating beacons; flags, streamers or strings of lights; or permanently installed or situated merchandise, shall be made to conform within ninety (90) days form the effective date of this ordinance. 
    The administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed, accordingly: the administrator shall give ninety (90) days' written notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this ordinance. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign within ninety (90) days after the ninety-day written notice has been given, the administrator or his duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings according to the procedures specified in G.S. Section 160A-175. 
Section 130. - Termination of Miscellaneous Nonconforming Situations. 
(a)  Within one (1) year after the effective date of this ordinance any violation of Subsection 149(c)(3) shall cease, and thereafter any situation in violation of that subdivision shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation. 
(b)  Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this ordinance any violation of Subsection 149(c)(4) shall cease, and thereafter any situation in violation of that subdivision shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation. 
(c)  Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of subsection 150(d) or any amendments thereto, any violation of that section shall cease, and thereafter any situation in violation of that subsection shall no longer be regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation.

ARTICLE IX. - ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP 
PART I. - ZONING DISTRICTS 

Section 135. - Residential Districts Established. 
(a)  The following residential districts are hereby established: AR-20, RA-20, RA-12, RA-8, RA-6, and MHP. Each of these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other objectives of some of these districts are explained in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The AR-20 district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for very low-density, single-family residential and agricultural purposes. Single-family detached residences and manufactured homes situated on individual lots are permitted in this district at a density of two and one tenth (2.1) dwelling units per acre. The AR-20 district is intended to encourage land uses that do not require major utility extensions and street improvements. 
(c)  The RA-20 district is established to allow principally single-family residences, including manufactured homes on individual lots, at a density of two and one tenth (2.1) dwelling units per acre which are interspersed with large, undeveloped open areas. 
(d)  The RA-12 district is established to allow primarily single-family residences on individual lots at a density of three and six-tenths (3.6) dwelling units per acre. 
(e)  The RA-8 district is established to allow a variety of single-family residences, two-family residences, and multifamily residences (other than apartments) at a density of up to eight (8) dwelling units per acre. 
(f)  The RA-6 district is established to allow a variety of single-family residences, two-family residences, and multifamily residences at a density of up to ten (10) units per acre. 
(g)  The MHP district is established to allow primarily manufactured home parks in areas that have the necessary public utilities to support such developments. 
(Ord. No. 00-09, § 2, 5-8-00; Ord. No. 03-09, § 1, 3-10-03) 
Section 136. - Commercial Districts Established. 
(a)  The following commercial districts are hereby established: B-1, B-2, B-3 and OI. Each of these districts is created to accomplish the purpose and serve the objectives set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The B-1 district is established as a district in which to accommodate a wide variety of commercial activities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) in an intensive development pattern in the town's central business district. The regulations of this district are intended to preserve the general character and integrity of the current development in the central business district; encourage land uses which provide for a multipurpose central business district including retail, offices, services, entertainment, and living space; encourage land uses which do not require large amounts of outdoor use areas; and encourage common or shared off-street parking. 
(c)  The B-2 district is established as a district in which to include shopping centers which provide areas for commercial and service uses and in which parking and traffic congestion are regulated to keep disruption to surrounding residential areas to a minimum. 
(d)  The B-3 district is established as a district in which to accommodate highway-oriented retail and commercial service businesses which generally have as their market area the entire town and surrounding area. The major objectives of this district are to encourage planned commercial and office parks; discourage small lot development on major highways; encourage vehicular access from service drives and other local commercial streets rather than directly from arterial streets; and provide a location for major shopping facilities and land uses requiring large outdoor spaces. 
(e)  The OI district is established as a district in which to allow primarily office and institutional land uses. In addition, single-family residential uses are permitted within the OI district. The major objectives of this district are to encourage land uses which serve as an adequate buffer between intensive nonresidential uses and residential uses; and provide aesthetic controls and dimensional requirements to ensure compatible office and service development with surrounding residential uses. 
Section 137. - Industrial Districts Established. 
(a)  The following industrial districts are hereby established: I-1 and I-2. Land uses in industrial districts are limited to those uses determined to be compatible with the character of the community. Uses permitted in industrial districts are restricted to the Standard Industrial Classification Code-designated uses delineated in Section 166. Each of these districts is created to accomplish the purposes and to serve the objectives set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The I-1 district is established to allow light manufacturing, wholesale sales, limited retail sales, and accessory land uses incidental to and in support of industrial uses. 
(c)  The I-2 district is established to allow general manufacturing, wholesale sales, and accessory land uses incidental to and in support of industrial uses. 
Section 138. - Overlay Districts Established. 
(a)  Five (5) special control overlay districts are hereby established: FHO (Flood Hazard Overlay), AHO (Airport Hazard Overlay), HO (Historic Overlay), WCA (Watershed Critical Area Overlay), and WPA (Watershed Protected Area Overlay). These special control overlay districts are intended to be superimposed over the underlying general zoning district, and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district. In addition, the AO (Apartment Overlay) district is hereby established. This district is intended to be superimposed over certain property zoned RA-8, and authorizes such property to be developed as provided in subsection (f) of this section in addition to the purposes authorized within the RA-8 zoning district. The specific objectives of each of these overlay districts are explained in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The FHO district is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for the purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard districts are further described in Part I of Article XVI of this ordinance. 
(c)  The AHO district is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts in the vicinity of the Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport. The purpose of the AHO is to protect the airport environs from encroachment of incompatible land uses which present hazards to users of the airport as well as to persons residing or working in the airport vicinity. The additional regulations imposed in the AHO are designed to place additional height restrictions on buildings and trees. The additional regulations governing land development in the AHO district are delineated in Section 167. 
(d)  The HO district is established as an overlay district for all general zoning districts that contain structures or other facilities of historic significance. The purpose of the HO is to protect and conserve the heritage and character of the Tarboro community by providing for the preservation of designated historical areas within the planning jurisdiction. No new historic districts nor any change to the boundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources shall have been given an opportunity, in accordance with Chapter 160A, Article 19, Part 3A of the North Carolina General Statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the establishment of such new district or change in the boundaries of an existing district. The additional regulations governing land development in the HO district are delineated in Section 168. 
(e)  The watershed districts are established as overlay districts for all general zoning districts for the purpose of (i) protecting portions of the designated Tar River public water supply watershed from activities which could degrade water quality, (ii) reducing the volume of nutrients and other chemicals which could enter the water supply by reducing the amount of runoff which any given development will generate, (iii) minimizing land disturbances to reduce the amount of sediment entering the river, and (iv) providing for natural and engineered methods of managing stormwater. The watershed overlay districts consist of two separate districts: the Watershed Critical Area Overlay District (WCA) and the Watershed Protected Area Overlay District (WPA). 
    The WCA District consists of that part of the Tar River public water supply watershed designated by the N.C. Environmental Management Commission and located within the Town of Tarboro planning jurisdiction that is one-half (1/2) mile upstream from and draining to the town's Tar River water intake or to the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first). The WPA District consists of that part of the Tar River public water supply watershed designated by the N.C. Environmental Management Commission and located within the Town of Tarboro planning jurisdiction that is ten (10) miles upstream from and draining to the town's Tar River water intake or to the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first). 
    The boundaries of the areas included in the watershed overlay districts are delineated on the official zoning map, as defined in Section 142. Land use within a watershed district must comply with all of the requirements of both the underlying general zoning district and the applicable watershed overlay district. Supplementary watershed district standards are delineated in Section 180.9. The supplementary standards and requirements of Section 180.9, however, are applicable only to new development activities which require an erosion and sedimentation control plan in accordance with the rules established by the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission. 
(f)  The AO district is established as an overlay district that may be superimposed over property zoned RA-8 where the Council concludes that such property is suitable for development for the full range of residential alternatives, including multifamily apartments, at the density allowable in the RA-6 district. Property that is zoned AO may be developed as authorized in the underlying RA-8 district. Such property may also be developed for any of the single-family, two-family, or multifamily residential purposes authorized in the RA-6 district, in accordance with the density regulations applicable to property zoned RA-6. Except as provided herein or in Section 169, all regulations applicable to the underlying RA-8 district shall apply to property zoned AO. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93; Ord. No. 03-09, § 2, 3-10-03) 
Section 139. - Conditional Zoning Districts. 
(a)  Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property so zoned are governed by the regulations applicable to one of the general use zoning districts established in Sections 135, 136, and 137, as modified by the conditions and restrictions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be established: AR-20-C, RA-20-C, RA-12-C, RA-8-C, RA-6-C, MHP-C, B-1-C, B-2-C, B-3-C, OI-C, I-1-C, I-2-C. 
(b)  The conditional zoning districts authorized by this section may be applied to property only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included within such district. 
(c)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (f), the uses permissible within a conditional zoning district authorized by this section, and the regulations applicable to property within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within and those regulations that are applicable to the general use zoning district to which the conditional district corresponds, except as those uses and regulations are limited by conditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. For example, property that is rezoned to a B-2-C district may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2, subject to any conditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d). 
(d)  When a rezoning petition for a conditional zoning district is submitted (in accordance with Article XX of this ordinance), the application shall include a list of proposed conditions (which may be in the form of written statements, graphic illustrations, or any combination thereof) to be incorporated into the ordinance that rezones the property to the requested conditional zoning district. The list of proposed conditions may be modified by the planning staff, planning board, or council as the rezoning application works its way through the process described in Article XX, but only those conditions mutually approved by the applicant and the council may be incorporated into the conditional zoning district. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to (i) those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to the provisions of this ordinance or to applicable plans adopted by the council, and (ii) those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. Such conditions and site-specific standards may add to the restrictions that would be applicable to the property if it were subject to the general use zoning district to which the conditional zoning district corresponds, but may not relieve the property of any such restrictions. To illustrate, a conditional zoning district may limit the uses that would be allowed or increase the setback requirements that would be applicable if the property were subject to the general use zoning district to which the conditional zoning district corresponds, but may not allow more uses or less restrictive setbacks than would be permissible under the corresponding general use district. 
(e)  All uses that are permissible in the conditional zoning district shall require the issuance of the same type of permit that such use in the corresponding general use district would ordinarily require according to the Table of Permissible Uses, i.e., a zoning permit or conditional use permit. 
(f)  Property that is zoned to a conditional zoning district shall also be subject to the requirements of any applicable overlay district (see Section 138).

PART II. - ZONING MAP 

Section 142. - Official Zoning Map. 
(a)  There shall be a map known and designated as the Official Zoning Map, which shall show the boundaries of all zoning districts within the town's planning jurisdiction. This map shall be drawn on acetate or other durable material from which prints can be made, shall be dated, shall be maintained by the town engineer, and current prints shall be kept in the Department of Planning and in the town clerk's office. 
(b)  The Official Zoning Map dated November 4, 1991, is adopted and incorporated herein by reference. Amendments to this map shall be made and posted in accordance with Section 143. 
(c)  Should the Official Zoning Map be lost, destroyed, or damaged, the administrator may have a new map drawn on acetate or other durable material from which prints can be made. No further council authorization or action is required so long as no district boundaries are changed in this process. 
Section 143. - Amendments to Official Zoning Map. 
(a)  Amendments to the Official Zoning Map are accomplished using the same procedures that apply to other amendments to this ordinance, as set forth in Article XX. 
(b)  The administrator shall update the Official Zoning Map as soon as possible after amendments to it are adopted by the town council. Upon entering any such amendment on the map, the administrator shall change the date of the map to indicate its latest revision. New prints of the updated map may then be issued. 
(c)  No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Zoning Map. 
(d)  The Planning Department shall keep copies of superseded prints of the zoning map for historical reference.

Section 147. - Use of the Designations Z and C in Table of Permissible Uses. 
(a)  Subject to Section 148, when used in connection with a particular use in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 146), the letter "Z" means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator. The letter "C" means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the town council. 
(b)  Use of the designation "ZC" for combination uses is explained in Section 154. 
(Ord. No. 00-09; § 4, 5-8-00) 
Section 148. - Planning Board Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible With a Zoning Permit. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of Permissible Uses (interpreted in the light of Section 147 and the other provisions of this article) provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit, a special use permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this determination, the administrator shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 04-06, § 1, adopted May 10, 2004, abolished the board of adjustment, therefore section 148 is amended to read as herein set out. Formerly, such section pertained to board of adjustment jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit. 
Section 149. - Permissible Uses and Specific Exclusions. 
(a)  The presumption established by this chapter [appendix] is that all legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one (1) zoning district in the town's planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the list of permissible uses set forth in Section 146 (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all-inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses. 
(b)  If a use cannot be interpreted by the administrator for inclusion in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 146) as provided for in Subsection (a), that use shall be prohibited. Section 146 (Table of Permissible Uses) shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one (1) zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts: 
(1)  Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the town's fire prevention code. 
(2)  Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants. 
(3)  Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence. (Situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of this chapter [appendix] are required to conform within one (1) year. See Section 130.) 
(4)  Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is conducted. (Situations that do not comply with this subdivision on the effective date of this chapter [appendix] are required to conform within thirty (30) days. See Section 130.) This subsection shall not, however, apply to temporary uses allowed in accordance with Section 161. 
Section 150. - Accessory Uses. 
(a)  The Table of Permissible Uses (Section 146) classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit (use classification 6.210). 
(b)  For purposes of interpreting Subsection (a): 
(1)  A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use; 
(2)  To be "commonly associated" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of Subsections (a) and (b), the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above: 
(1)  Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation. 
(2)  Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature. 
(3)  Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three (3) days (whether consecutive or not) during any ninety-day period. 
(4)  The temporary use of a travel trailer, camper, or recreational vehicle by visitors to the occupant of a principal building, so long as such temporary use does not exceed seven (7) days. 
(5)  Daycare center providing services to five (5) non-resident children or less. 
(d)  Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts. 
(1)  Parking or storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither currently licensed nor operational. 
(2)  On premises within use classifications 1.100, 1.200, or 1.400, parking or storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than a total of five (5) vehicles or more than a total of two (2) vessels. For purposes of this subsection (d)(2), the term "vehicle" shall include an all terrain vehicle, farm tractor, golf cart, house trailer, moped, motorcycle, motor vehicle, property hauling vehicle, recreational vehicle, road tractor, trailer (including boat trailer), truck tractor, or other vehicle (other than a bicycle) as these terms are defined in G.S. § 20-4.01, and the term "vessel" shall mean any type of watercraft or structure designed, used, or capable of being used as a means of transportation or habitation on the water. A vessel upon a trailer shall be considered one unit. (This subdivision shall not apply to motor vehicles temporarily parked on the premises on an occasional basis by guests of the occupant of such premises). 
(3)  On premises within use classifications 1.100, 1.200, or 1.400, parking or storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of currently licensed motor vehicles (including trailers) outside a driveway clearly designated as such by covering such area with an all weather surface or by delineating the edges of such area through the use of landscape timbers, plantings, or other materials. (This subdivision shall not apply to motor vehicles temporarily parked on the premises on an occasional basis by guests of the occupant of such premises). 
(4)  On any residential premises within use classifications 1.100, 1.200, or 1.400 displaying motor vehicles for sale or trade under the following circumstances. 
a.  Displaying more than one such vehicle at any one time. 
b.  During a twelve month period commencing on January 1 and ending December 31 each year, displaying any such individual motor vehicle for more than one (1) period of any number of consecutive days or for more than forty-five (45) consecutive days. 
c.  During a twelve-month period commencing on January 1 and ending December 31 each year, displaying more than one such motor vehicle. 
d.  Displaying any such motor vehicle that is not owned by the occupant or an immediate family member of the occupant of the premises. 
e.  Displaying any such motor vehicle within a public right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 02-08, § 3, 5-13-02; Ord. No. 08-13, § 1, 11-10-08) 
Section 151. - Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter [appendix], no zoning or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses: 
(1)  Streets. 
(2)  Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way. 
(3)  Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the permission of the owner (state or town) of the right-of-way. 
Section 152. - Change in Use. 
(a)  A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever: 
(1)  The change involves a change from one principal use category to another. 
(2)  If the original use is a combination use (27.000), the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered. 
(3)  If the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes. 
(4)  If the original use is a planned residential development, the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change. 
(5)  If there is only one (1) business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one (1) individual principal use or a combination use), that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one (1) building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification 2.114. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one (1) business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center, combination use) has not changed. 
(b)  A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two (2) active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or has been abandoned. 
(c)  A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use. 
Section 153. - Reserved. 
Section 154. - Combination Uses. 
(a)  When a combination use comprises two (2) or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning or conditional use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be: 
(1)  A conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit. 
(2)  A zoning permit in all other cases. 
This is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation "ZC" in each of the columns adjacent to the 27.000 classification. 
(b)  When a combination use consists of a single-family detached residential subdivision that is not structurally integrated (see Section 188) and two-family or multifamily uses, the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot. 
(c)  When a combination use consists of a single-family detached, structurally integrated subdivision and two-family or multifamily uses, then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in Section 182. 
Section 155. - More Specific Use Controls. 
    Whenever a development could fall within more than one (1) use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 146), the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130, "physicians' and dentists' offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling. 
Sections 156, 157. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XI. - SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS 

Section 158. - Planned Residential Developments. 
(a)  Planned residential developments (PRD's) are permissible only as a conditional use on tracts of at least five (5) contiguous acres located within a RA-20, RA-12, RA-8, B-1, B-2 or B-3 zoning district. 
(b)  The overall density of a tract developed by a PRD shall be determined as provided in Section 182 for the underlying district in which the PRD is located. 
(c)  Permissible types of residential uses within a PRD include single-family detached dwellings (use classifications 1.111 and 1.112), single-family attached dwellings (1.130), two-family residences (1.200), and multifamily residences (1.300). At least fifty (50) percent of the total number of dwelling units must be single-family detached residences on lots of at least six thousand (6,000) square feet. 
(d)  A PRD shall be an structurally integrated subdivision. 
(e)  To the extent practicable, the two-family and multifamily portions of a PRD shall be developed more toward the interior rather than the periphery of the tract so that the single-family detached residences border adjacent single-family detached properties. 
(f)  In a planned residential development, the screening requirements that would normally apply where two-family or multifamily development adjoins a single-family development shall not apply within the tract developed as a planned residential development, but all screening requirements shall apply between the tract so developed and adjacent lots. 
(g)  Recreational space in each PRD shall be provided in accordance with Article XIII. 
Section 159. - Manufactured Home Parks. 
(a)  The minimum lot area for a manufactured home park is five (5) acres; the minimum number of manufactured home spaces for a manufactured home park is ten (10) spaces.

(c)  Each manufactured home space shall contain a minimum of six thousand (6,000) square feet. 
(d)  No manufactured home shall be located closer than twenty-five (25) feet from another manufactured home or any other principal building within the manufactured home park. No manufactured home shall be located closer than thirty (30) feet from a public street right-of-way or fifteen (15) feet from a private, interior manufactured home park street. No manufactured home shall be located closer than twenty (20) feet to an exterior manufactured home park boundary. 
(e)  Recreational space in each manufactured home park shall be provided in accordance with Article XIII.

(b)  Certification by a registered engineer shall be required to ensure the prevention of petroleum and petroleum related product runoffs into the existing municipal storm drainage system. 
(c)  All garbage and refuse shall be stored in mechanical loading containers located near the rear of the lot or building, but not less than twenty (20) feet from any adjacent property lines. 
(d)  All pump islands shall be set back from property or street lines in accordance with the provisions of Section 184 or a minimum of twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater. 
(e)  Bulk storage of petroleum products shall be located underground. 
Section 161. - Temporary Uses.

Section 167. - Airport Hazard Overlay District Requirements. 
(a)  The Airport Hazard Overlay (AHO) District is not intended to be utilized as a district classification, but as a designation which identifies areas subject to regulations which are supplementary to the regulations of the district to which such designation is attached, appended or "overlaid." Regulations which apply to areas designated on the zoning map as being within such appended or overlaid designation must be determined by joint reference to the regulations of both the basic district classification and the appended or overlay classification. 
(b)  It is the intent of this section to restrain influences which are adverse to the property and safe conduct of aircraft in the vicinity of the Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport, to prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation, to prevent conflict with land development which may result in loss of life and property, and to encourage development which is compatible with airport use characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, the AHO designation, when appended to a basic district classification, is intended to coordinate the purpose and intent of this section with other regulations duly established by the Town of Tarboro whose primary intent is to further the purposes set out above. 
(c)  The following definitions shall apply to this section: 
(1)  Airport: Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport. 
(2)  Airport elevation: The highest point of an airport's useable landing area measured in feet above mean sea level (52.0 feet). 
(3)  Approach surface: A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in Subsection (4) below. 
(4)  Approach zone: The inner edge approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and begins two hundred (200) feet from the runway end and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of two thousand (2,000) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(5)  Conical surface: A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
(6)  Conical zone: The conical zone is established on the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom for a distance of four thousand (4,000) feet, and upward at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1). 
(7)  Hazard to navigation: An obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. 
(8)  Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in the airport height restrictive area, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
(9)  Horizontal surface: A horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincided with the perimeter of the horizontal zone. 
(10)  Horizontal zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand (5,000) feet radii from the center of the end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(11)  Obstruction: Any structure, growth or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limited height set forth in Subsection (d) of this section. 
(12)  Primary surface: A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The primary surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is five hundred (500) feet. 
(13)  Runway: A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
(14)  Transitional surfaces: These surfaces extend outward at right angles (ninety-degree angles) to the runway centerline and extend at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. 
(15)  Transitional zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(d)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no trees shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this section to a height in excess of the applicable height limitations herein established for each zone in questions as follows: 
(1)  Approach Zone (AHO-A): Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway centerline. The inner dimension is five hundred (500) feet and its outer dimension is two thousand (2,000) feet. 
(2)  Transitional Zones (AHO-T): Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the side of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or two hundred and two (202) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the horizontal surface. 
(3)  Horizontal Zone (AHO-H): Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport or at an elevation of two hundred and two (202) feet above the mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical Zone (AHO-C): Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred and fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to an elevation of four hundred and two (402) feet above mean sea level. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this section in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
(f)  The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this section, and is diligently prosecuted. 
    Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport Authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport Authority. 
(g)  The administrator shall not issue a zoning permit within an AHO-A, AHO-H or AHO-T area until it has been determined that the proposal upon which he is requested to act is in compliance with the terms of these regulations. 
(1)  Except as specifically provided in (i), (ii), and (iii) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Subsection (4). 
(i)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(ii)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(iii)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet above the ground, except when such tree or structure because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions, shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this section except as set forth in Subsection (c). 
(2)  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this section, or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(3)  Whenever the administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than sixty (60) percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(4)  Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in this section may apply to the planning board for a variance in accordance with the provisions of Section 92. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief, if granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in accordance with the spirit of this section. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this section may be considered by the planning board unless a copy of this application has been furnished to the airport manager and/or the airport authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager and/or airport authority does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the planning board may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(5)  Any permit or variance granted, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and be reasonable in the circumstances, may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate or maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the planning board, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Tarboro-Edgecombe Airport Authority, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 168. - Historic Overlay District Requirements. 
(a)  The use and development of any land or structure within the Historic Overlay (HO) District shall comply with the use regulations and intensity regulations applicable to the underlying zoning district except that no manufactured home, multifamily conversion, multifamily townhome, or multifamily apartment shall be located within an Historic Overlay District. 
(b)  No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), or any above-ground utility structure, or any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within the Historic District until after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to and approved by the Historic District Commission. 
    For purposes of this article, "exterior architectural features" shall include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, "exterior architectural features" shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, and location of all such signs. 
    Such a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued by the Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or any other permit granted for purposes of constructing, altering, or demolishing buildings or structures. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required whether or not a building permit is required. Any building permit or other permit not issued in conformity with this section shall be invalid. 
(c)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the Historic District that does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, or to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or demolition of any such feature that the Building Inspector or similar official shall certify is required by the public safety because of unsafe or dangerous condition. Ordinary maintenance or repair shall include, but is not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Painting of structures, when said painting is not connected with alteration or new construction. 
(2)  Interior work which does not result in any exterior changes. 
(3)  Planting of yard vegetables, shrubbery, trees, etc. 
(4)  Replacement of window glass with a pane of equal dimensions and transparency. 
(5)  Caulking and weatherstripping. 
(6)  Installation on the rear or side of the house, window air condition[er]s, television antennas, and other temporary mechanical equipment. 
(7)  Repairs to walks, patios, fences, and driveways, so long as the replacement materials match the original. 
(8)  Replacement of small amounts of missing or deteriorated siding, roof shingles, porch flooring, steps or railing, so long as the replacement materials are identical to the original. (For siding, roofing and porch flooring, twenty (20) square feet or less shall be considered normal maintenance.) 
On the basis of preliminary sketches or drawings and other supporting data, the administrator may exempt from requirements for a Certificate of Appropriateness projects involving the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature that does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof. The administrator shall notify the Commission of all such exemptions. 
(d)  Procedures for approval of certificates of appropriateness: 
(1)  Application Submittal Requirements: 
Applications for Certificates of Appropriateness shall be filed with the administrator. 
The administrator shall prescribe the form(s) on which applications are made, as well as any other material which may reasonably be required to determine the nature of the application. 
The Commission may specify criteria for situations in which the administrator may waive any of the application material requirements. 
No application shall be accepted by the administrator unless it complies with such requirements. Applications which are not complete shall be returned forthwith to the applicant, with a notation of the deficiencies in the application. 
(2)  Notification of affected property owners: Prior to approval or denial of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Public hearing: In cases where the Commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
(4)  Commission Action: Within sixty (60) days of the acceptance of an application, or within such further time consented to by written notice from the applicant, the Commission shall take action on the application. Such action shall be based upon the review criteria established in Subsection (c) of this section, and shall be one (1) of the following: 
a.  Approval. 
b.  Approval subject to conditions. 
c.  Denial. 
Failure of the Commission to take final action on an application within the prescribed time limit, or extensions thereof, shall result in approval of the application as submitted. 
The Commission may impose such reasonable conditions on its approval of an application as will ensure that the spirit and intent of this article are achieved. 
An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the relocation, demolition, or destruction of a building or structure within the Historic District may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period, the Commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the Commission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the Historic District, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. 
In every case, the record of the Commission's action shall include the reasons for its action. 
(5)  Actions subsequent to decision: The administrator shall notify the applicant of the Commission's decision in writing, and shall file a copy of it with the Town's Planning Department. If the applicant is denied, the notice shall include the reasons for such action. 
(6)  Appeal of decision: A decision by the Commission on an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be appealed to the planning board in accordance with the provisions of Article V. 
(7)  Submission of new application: If the Commission denies an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted only if substantive change is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving. 
(8)  Modifications to applications: An approved or pending application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be modified by a written request from the applicant to the Commission. Such a request shall include a description of the proposed change and shall be accompanied by elevations, plans or sketches, where necessary. If the Commission finds that the modification constitutes a substantial change which might affect surrounding property owners, it shall request the applicant to notify affected property owners following the procedures set out in Subsection (d)(2) before taking action on the modification. The Commission shall thereupon treat the request in the same manner as any other application as outlined in Subsection (d). 
(e)  Review criteria. In considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall take into account the historical and/or architectural significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure that are visible from a public right-of-way. The Commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use. 
    The Commission, using the criteria below, shall make findings of fact indicating the extent to which the application is or is not congruous with the historic aspects of the Historic District. The following criteria shall be considered, when relevant, by the Commission in review applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness: 
(1)  The height of the building in relation to the average height of the nearest adjacent and opposite buildings. 
(2)  The setback and placement on lot of the building in relation to the average setback and placement of the nearest adjacent and opposite buildings. 
(3)  Exterior construction materials, including texture and pattern. 
(4)  Architectural detailing, such as lintels, cornices, brick bond, and foundation materials. 
(5)  Roof shapes, forms, and materials. 
(6)  Proportion, shape, positioning and location, pattern, and size of any elements of fenestration. 
(7)  General form and proportions of buildings and structures. 
(8)  Appurtenant fixtures and other features such as lighting. 
(9)  Structural conditions and soundness. 
(10)  Architectural scale. 
(f)  Where the Historic District Commission, in considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall find that the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance for a building or structure for which a building permit is requested would render the building and/or parking area incongruous with the historic aspects of the district, it shall recommend to the planning board a waiver, in part or in whole, of the off-street parking requirements. The planning board may authorize a lesser number of off-street parking spaces, provided: 
(1)  The board finds that the lesser number of off-street parking spaces will not create problems due to increasing on-street parking; and 
(2)  Will not constitute a threat to the public safety. 
(g)  Where it is found by the Historic District Commission that an application for a building permit covers activity constituting an authentic restoration or reconstruction in the same location as the original location and in the original configuration of a structure of historic and/or architectural significance to the Historic District, such activity may be approved by the planning board, following approval by the Historic District Commission. This allows the waiver of zoning requirements which would otherwise prevent the authentic restoration or reconstruction of a structure so long as said improvement shall meet the requirements of the Commission. 
    The planning board shall not be authorized, in action undertaken by this section, to approve a use of property which is not a use permitted by right or as a conditional use within the district in which the property is located. 
    In addition to any other conditions the planning board may make regarding such authorization, any items restored, reconstructed or maintained on, over or within a public sidewalk, public alley area or other such public way shall be the responsibility of the owner, his heirs and assigns. The owner's restoration, reconstruction or maintenance of any such item within such area shall constitute the owner's agreement to protect and hold the Town of Tarboro harmless against any and all liability, cost, damage or expense suffered by the Town of Tarboro as a result of or growing out of the restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored, reconstructed or maintained. Any such item projecting over the right-of-way of a street or alley shall be, at its lowest point, twelve (12) feet above the travel way. 
(h)  The planning director or his designee is authorized to approve minor works with a Certificate of Appropriateness with prior categorical consent by the Commission. For any work not approved as minor, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness must be reviewed by the commission. 
    The planning director or his designee shall use the following criteria in determining whether a proposed action is a minor work: 
(1)  Renewal of expired Certificate of Appropriateness where no change or circumstances under which the certificate was approved originally. 
(2)  Street, sidewalk and underground utility work which does not substantially change the appearance of the streetscape, such a replacement of water and sewer lines, street resurfacing and installation or replacement of sidewalk and curbing. 
(3)  Replacement of missing or deteriorated siding, porch floors or roof shingles in excess of twenty (20) square feet; trim, ceiling, columns and balustrades or architectural details with new materials that are identical to the original. 
(4)  Removal of asbestos, asphalt or other artificial siding when the original siding is to be repaired and repainted. 
(5)  Installation of metal foundation vents on side and rear only, soffit and roof vents, gable end vents and replacement of wood access doors. Installation of foundation access doors which cannot easily be seen from the street. 
(6)  Installation of mechanical equipment such as satellite receiving dishes, heating and air conditioning units, etc., which cannot be seen easily from the street or are screened from view with shrubbery or appropriate fencing. 
(7)  Minor work where there is no change in materials or appearance of the structure and where the visual character of the structure is not changed, i.e., replacement of a deteriorated front porch floor when new material matches the original. 
(8)  Repair or replacement of masonry foundation where the original foundation material is retained or where new material matches the original. 
(9)  Small identification signs or historic markers previously approved by the Commission. 
(10)  Repainting and other masonry repairs when the color and composition of the mortar matches the original and new brick or stone matches the original. 
(11)  Installation of storm windows so long as they are of one-over-one construction and the sash and trim are not covered and a baked enamel finish which compliments or matches the structure is used. 
(12)  Installation of storm doors so long as they are of "full view" type and highlight the features of the main door and frame and a baked enamel finish which compliments or matches the structure is used. 
(Ord. No. 00-09, § 5, 5-8-00; Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 169. - Multifamily Residences. 
(a)  Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, multifamily residences (use classification 1.300) located in any permitted nonresidential zoning district shall comply with the minimum lot area, width, and setback requirements of the RA-6 district. 
(b)  The minimum spacing between multifamily residential structures shall be twenty (20) feet.

No single-family residential lot area shall be less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or fourteen thousand five hundred (14,500) square feet for projects without a curb and gutter street system, unless located within an approved cluster development in accordance with subsection (d). All other types of residential development shall comply with the built-upon area requirements of (c)(2). 
Where public water and/or public sewer service is not available, a greater lot area may be required by the Edgecombe County Health Department. 
(2)  Built-upon area. All residential development, other than single-family development, and all nonresidential development shall be allowed a twenty-four-percent built-upon area or thirty-six-percent built-upon area for projects without a curb and gutter street system. For purposes of calculating built-upon area, total project area shall include acreage in the tract on which the project is to be developed. 
(3)  Permitted uses. Uses allowed in the underlying general zoning district or another applicable overlay district are permitted within the WPA, except for the following: 
a.  Storage and treatment of hazardous material unless a spill containment plan is implemented. 
b.  Reserved. 
(4)  Best management practices. Forestry operations, if allowed in the underlying general zoning district, are subject to the provisions of the Forest Practice Guidelines Related to Water Quality (15 ANCAC II.0101-.0209). 
The construction of new roads and bridges and nonresidential development shall minimize built-upon area, divert stormwater away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ best management practices to minimize water quality impacts. The N.C. Department of Transportation shall use best management practices as outlined in their document entitled "Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters." 
(d)  Cluster developments. To the extent authorized in Section 187, cluster development is allowed in all WCA and WPA overlay districts, provided that the following conditions are met:

(2)  All built-upon areas shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow. 
(3)  The remainder of the tract not built upon shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. Where the development has an incorporated homeowners' or property owners' association, the title of the reserved open space area shall be conveyed to the association for management. Where a property association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds. 
(4)  The proposed cluster development will be served by public water and sewer facilities. 
(e)  Buffer areas. A minimum one-hundred-foot vegetative buffer is required for all new development activities that utilize the high density development option authorized by Section 180.9(i); otherwise, a minimum thirty-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government studies. Desirable artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization is permitted. 
    Agricultural activities in a WCA overlay district shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or equivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps. 
    No new development is allowed in the buffer except for water-dependent structures and public projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practicable alternative exists. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization of stormwater best management practices. 
(f)  Existing development. Existing development, as defined in Section 15, is not subject to the provisions of the watershed overlay district requirements. Redevelopment of and expansion to existing development is allowed as provided for herein.

(3)  Lighting shall not exceed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) minimum if lighting is required by the FAA. To the extent allowed by the FAA, strobes shall not be used for nighttime lighting. The lights shall be oriented so as not to project directly onto surrounding residential property, consistent with FAA requirements. The applicant shall be required to submit documentation from the FAA that the lighting is the minimum lighting required by the FAA. 
(4)  Towers and antennas shall be constructed and operated so as not to disturb or interfere with the use or operation on adjoining or nearby properties of radios, televisions, telephones, or similar equipment. 
(5)  Commercial messages may not be displayed. 
(6)  The output from the tower may not exceed federally approved levels for exposure to electronic magnetic force (EMF). The applicant shall be required to submit documentation with the application verifying compliance with this standard. 
(7)  If the tower is up to 180 feet in height, the tower shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate at least one (1) additional telecommunication user. If the tower exceeds one hundred eighty (180) feet, the tower shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate at least two (2) additional telecommunication users. Furthermore, the site plan must show locations for accessory buildings necessary to accommodate a minimum of two users, even if the tower is proposed for a single user. 
(8)  The base of the tower and each guy anchor shall be surrounded by a fence or wall at least eight (8) feet in height and constructed of materials that cannot be easily climbed or penetrated, unless the tower and all guy wires are mounted entirely on a building at least eight (8) feet in height. 
(9)  The base of the tower, any guy wires, and any associated structures, walls, or fences shall be surrounded by a Type A screening. The site developer shall have the option of (i) providing the screening around the tower base and associated items individually, or (ii) providing the screening around the perimeter of the entire site. 
(10)  Outdoor storage shall not be permissible on tower sites. 
(11)  In addition to other information that must be submitted with the application, the application for a tower must contain the following information: 
a.  Identification of the intended user(s) of the tower. 
b.  Documentation provided by a registered engineer that the tower has sufficient structural integrity to accommodate more than one (1) user. 
c.  Documentation by the applicant that no suitable existing facilities within the coverage area are available to the applicant. Documentation may include maps, letters from adjacent tower owners, or calculations. Facilities include other towers, or other buildings or structures. 
d.  A statement indicating the owners intent to allow shared use of the tower and how many other users can be accommodated. 
(12)  The recipient of a permit for a tower shall be required as a continuing condition on the validity of the permit, to submit to the zoning administrator by January 31st of each year documentation, including but not limited to an FCC license, that the tower is being utilized. Towers, which are not used for a period of six (6) months or more, shall be removed by the owner within ninety (90) days thereafter. A statement of financial responsibility and performance security shall be posted for each tower to guarantee compliance with this requirement. 
(13)  In any residential zone, associated buildings or other buildings located on the same lot and owned or used by the applicant, its associates, or any co-users shall not be used as an employment center for any worker. This subsection does not prohibit the periodic maintenance or periodic monitoring of instruments and equipment. 
(14)  The tower shall be constructed with a grounding system that provides adequate protection from destruction or damage by lighting. 
(15)  The proposed addition of another users antenna to a preexisting tower, or any substantial change in the previously approved tower, shall constitute a minor modification. 
(16)  In addition to the considerations for conditional or special use permits found in Section 54 of this ordinance, the approving bodies in determining whether a tower is in harmony with the area of a tower on the value of adjoining or abutting properties may consider the aesthetic effects of the tower as well as mitigating factors concerning aesthetics, and may disapprove a tower on the grounds that such aesthetic effects are not acceptable. Factors relevant to aesthetic effects are the protection of the view in sensitive or particularly scenic areas and areas specially designated in adopted plans such as unique natural features, scenic roadways and historic sites; the concentration of towers in the proposed areas; and whether the height, design, placement or other characteristics of the proposed tower could be modified to have a less intrusive impact. 
(Ord. No. 95-1, § 2, 2-13-95; Ord. No. 99-4, § 1, 5-10-99; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1, 12-11-06) 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 95-1, § 2, adopted February 13, 1995, amended App. B by adding a new § 180.10. Inasmuch as § 180.10 already existed herein, such new provisions were added as § 180.11 at the discretion of the editor. 
Section 180.12. - Adult Establishments. 
(a)  Adult uses/establishments are subject to the restrictions set forth in this section because such uses may have significant secondary effects on the neighborhoods in which they are located. Numerous studies from cities such as Kansas City, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and the following specific studies (A Report on the Secondary Impacts of Adult Use Businesses in the City of Denver, City of Denver, January, 1998; Adult Entertainment Study, New York Department of City Planning, New York, 1994; Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis, City of Indianapolis, 1984) have indicated that a concentration of adult businesses can have significant negative impacts on the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and that the establishment of adult uses offering on-premise entertainment frequently results in secondary impacts related to public safety and neighborhood property values. Studies have shown that a concentration of adult businesses is correlated to an increase in crime rates in the areas where such businesses are clustered. Regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods. 
(b)  The town council has also determined that adult uses should be separated from schools, churches, child care centers, parks and playgrounds, libraries, and residential neighborhoods where children and young adults may congregate. The council concludes that the negative secondary impacts of adult establishments are heightened when such uses are in proximity to residential areas or uses where children or young adults assemble. It is the intent of this Section to establish reasonable regulations to prevent the concentration of adult establishments within the Town of Tarboro and to require the separation of adult establishments from the sensitive uses identified herein. 
(c)  Adult establishments shall include an adult bookstore, adult motion picture theater, adult mini motion picture theater, adult live entertainment business or massage business as they are defined in G.S. 14-202.10, except that only those massage businesses in which a person performing the massage does so while exhibiting "specified anatomical areas" (as defined in G.S. 14-202.10) or in which the massage involves the intentional stimulation of specified anatomical areas shall be restricted by the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Adult establishments shall be allowed in accordance with Section 146 Table of Permissible Uses subject to the following: 
(1)  No property associated with the use shall be within one thousand (1,000) feet of any area zoned or used for residential purposes (including retirement/nursing homes). 
(2)  No property associated with the use shall be within one thousand (1,000) feet of any existing child day care center, park, playground, public or private school, library, and/or church; 
(3)  The minimum straight line distance between the property lines of two (2) adult establishments shall be one thousand (1,000) feet. No two (2) adult establishments shall be located within the same building. 
(4)  Outside advertising of an adult establishment shall be limited to one (1) sign, which shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in surface area, and shall contain only the name of the establishment. It shall not contain any advertising, or identification of any product, service, etc. 
(5)  In order to reduce exposure to minors and protect surrounding businesses, all exterior windows shall be opaque. 
(e)  This ordinance does not conflict with North Carolina state laws regulating pornographic materials and activities; but rather it regulates the operation and location of adult establishments whose materials or activities are legal. 
(Ord. No. 08-05, § 2, 5-12-08) 
Section 180.13. - Internet cafés. 
(a)  It is the intent of this provision to establish reasonable regulations to prevent a concentration of internet cafés within the town and to provide a buffer between internet cafes and the protected uses specified below. Internet cafés are permitted in B-2 and B-3 districts subject to the following standards: 
(1)  Separation from other internet café uses. Any structure in which an internet cafe is operating shall be separated by a distance of at least five hundred (500) feet (determined by a straight line and not street distance, without regard to intervening structures or objects) from any other internet café use. 
(2)  Separation from other uses. Any structure in which an internet cafe is operating shall be separated by a distance of at least five hundred (500) feet (determined by a straight line and not street distance, without regard to intervening structures or objects) from any residential zoning district, OI (office and institutional) zoning district, adult entertainment establishment, any school, church, childcare center, public park, or playground. 
(3)  Such internet café uses shall only be allowed as principal or primary use and shall not be permitted as an accessory use to any other principal or primary use. 
(4)  The distance for the separation from residential zoning and other protected uses shall be measured from the closest edge of the building occupied by an internet cafe to the nearest property line of the residential zoning district or OI (office and institutional) zoning district, or to the property line of a protected use. The distance for the separation between adult establishments shall be measured from the closest edges of the buildings occupied by internet cafe use. 
(5)  No more than one (1) internet café may be located within the same structure. 
(6)  Internet cafés shall not be permitted in any local historic district. 
(Ord. No. 10-04, § 3, 5-10-10) 
Section 180.15. - Microbrewery. 
    The following requirements apply to microbreweries in the B-1 and B-3 zoning districts: 
(1)  No drive thru facilities permitted. 
(2)  The area designated for brewing beer shall not exceed ten thousand (10,000) square feet. 
(3)  To the extent practicable, an off street or alley loading area shall be required. If an off street or alley loading area is not practicably available, the use may be approved with a side street loading area if the development review committee concludes that the use of such street for this purpose will not endanger or unduly inconvenience motorists, pedestrians, customers, or employees of the microbrewery. 
(Ord. No. 13-07, § 4, 6-10-2013) 
Section 180.16. - Minor solar energy facility. 
(a)  In residential zoning districts, minor solar facilities shall be allowed in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Front yard placement is prohibited. 
(2)  Front façade and roof slope placement (if facing street or common access) is prohibited unless solar panels are integrated in design and not noticeable from said street or common access. 
(3)  Side and rear slope placement permitted as an accessory use in all districts subject to the issuance of a zoning permit. 
(4)  Side and rear yard placement permitted as an accessory use in all districts subject to the issuance of a zoning permit. 
(b)  In non-residential zoning districts, minor solar energy facilities shall be allowed in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Minor free-standing solar facilities on non-residential property are subject to the same supplementary use standards as a major solar energy facility except the minimum lot size standard. 
(2)  Minor solar energy facilities on flat roofs, roof slopes not facing a street or common access, and building integrated solar panels on roof slopes facing the street that are not noticeable are permitted in any non-residential district. 
(c)  Minor free-standing facilities must comply with accessory structure setbacks. 
(d)  Minor free-standing facilities shall be a maximum of five (5) feet in height as measured from the grade at the base of the structure to the apex of the structure. 
(e)  Minor rooftop solar energy facilities shall not be considered as rooftop equipment on any building type and therefore do not require screening. 
(Ord. No. 13-06, § 4, 6-10-2013) 
Section 180.17. - Major solar energy facility. 
(a)  Major solar energy facilities are exempt from the parking requirements of article XVIII if there is no commercial or office building component. 
(b)  Major solar energy facilities shall meet the minimum required setbacks for the underlying zoning district for installations in the I-1 and I-2 zoning districts. 
(c)  Free standing major solar facilities shall be a maximum of eight (8) feet in height as measured from the grade at the base of the structure to the apex of the structure. 
(d)  The minimum lot size requirement for major solar facilities is ten (10) acres. 
(e)  Any major solar energy facility shall be enclosed with an opaque fence at least eight (8) feet in height. 
(f)  Town of Tarboro shall be given copies of any lease agreement and plan for removal of facility/equipment. 
(g)  Glare resistant solar panels shall be used if the solar facility is adjacent to any airport. 
(h)  Rooftop major solar energy facilities shall not be considered as rooftop equipment of any building type and therefore do not require screening. 
(Ord. No. 13-06, § 4, 6-10-2013) 
ARTICLE XII. - DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS 

Section 181. - Minimum Lot Size. 
(a)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 187 (Cluster Subdivisions) and 188 (Structurally Integrated Subdivisions), all lots in the following zones shall have at least the amount of square footage indicated in the following table:** 
Zone Minimum Square Feet AR-20 20,000 RA-20 20,000 RA-12 12,000 RA-8  8,000 RA-6  6,000 MHP 5 acres B-1 No minimum B-2 1 acre B-3 No minimum OI 5,000; 6,000 for 
residential use I-1 10,000 I-2 No minimum  
(b)  The minimum lot sizes set forth in this section are permissible only if and to the extent that adequate water and sewer facilities are or can be made available to serve every lot in accordance with the provisions of Article XV of this ordinance. For example, in some areas zoned RA-20 that are not served by public sewer, lots may have to exceed the twenty thousand-square-feet-minimum required below in order to accommodate septic tanks. In such cases and in cases where lots of less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet are proposed and such lots do not have access to sewage treatment facility or county sewer lines, the Health Department, Environmental Health Division shall review and approve proposed plans as provided in Sections 238 and 239. 
Section 182. - Residential Density. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b) and the provisions of Sections 187 (Cluster Subdivisions) and 188 (Structurally Integrated Subdivisions), every lot developed for residential purposes shall have the number of square feet per dwelling unit indicated in the following table. In determining the number of dwelling units permissible on a tract of land, fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
Zone Minimum Square Feet 
Per Dwelling Unit AR-20 20,000 RA-20 20,000 RA-12 12,000 RA-8 8,000 for 1 unit; 
10,500 for 2 units; 2,600 for each

additional unit MHP 6,000 B-1 Same as RA-6 B-2 Same as RA-6 B-3 Same as RA-6 OI 6,000  
(b)  In districts permitting two-family or multifamily dwellings, where the area of the property is such that a portion remains after full requirements have been met for other dwelling units on the same property, the following rules shall apply in determining density, and no relaxation of these rules shall be permitted by a variance. If otherwise permitted by the regulations of a district: 
(1)  A total of two (2) units shall be permitted on a lot containing area for one unit and ninety-five (95) percent of the area for the second. 
(2)  A total of three (3) units shall be permitted on a lot containing area for two (2) units and ninety (90) percent of the area required for a third. 
(3)  A total of four (4) units shall be permitted on a lot containing area for three (3) units and eighty-five (85) percent of the area for a fourth. 
(4)  One (1) additional unit shall be permitted on a lot containing area for four (4) or more units and eighty (80) percent of the area required for the additional unit. 
Section 183. - Minimum Lot Widths. 
(a)  No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that it would be impracticable to construct on it a building that: 
(1)  Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district; and 
(2)  Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, the following minimum average lot widths are recommended and are deemed presumptively to satisfy the standard set forth in Subsection (a). The lot width shall be measured along a straight line connecting the points at which a line that demarcates the required setback from the street intersects with lot boundary lines at opposite sides of the lot. 
Zone Average Minimum 
Lot Width AR-20 100 feet RA-20 100 feet RA-12 80 feet RA-8 70 feet, 1 unit; 
80 feet, 2 units; 
100 feet, 3 or 
more units RA-6 60 feet, 1 unit; 
70 feet, 2 units; 
100 feet, 3 or 
more units MHP None B-1 None B-2 None B-3 None OI 60 feet I-1 75 feet I-2 None  
(c)  No lot created after the effective date of this chapter [appendix] that is less than the recommended width shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement. 
Section 184. - Building Setback Requirements. 
(a)  Subject to Sections 185 and 188 and the other provisions of this section, no portion of any building may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-way line than is authorized in the table set forth below. 
(1)  If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set irons, or other means), the setback shall be measured from such right-of-way line. 
(2)  As used in this section, the term "lot boundary line" refers to lot boundaries other than those that abut streets. 
(3)  As used in this section, the term "building" includes any substantial structure which, by nature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual obstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated with a building. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following structures shall be deemed to fall within this description: 
a.  Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs. 
b.  Fences running along lot boundaries adjacent to public street rights-of-way if such fences exceed six (6) feet in height and are substantially opaque. 
Minimum Minimum Minimum Distance (in feet) Distance (in feet) Distance (in feet) From Street From Side Lot From Rear Lot Zone Right-of-Way Boundary Line Boundary Line AR-20 40 12 30 RA-20 40 12 30 RA-12 40 12 30 RA-8 40 10 30 RA-6 30  8 30 MHP 30 20 20 B-1 - - - B-2 30 - - B-3 30 - - OI 15 10 15 I-1 30 20 25 I-2 30 - -  
(b)  Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot in a residential district, and the property line setback requirement applicable to the residential lot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential lot, then the lot in the nonresidential district shall be required to observe the property line setback requirement applicable to the adjoining residential lot. 
(c)  Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to a point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building that is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a flagpole, etc.). 
(d)  Whenever a private road that serves more than three (3) lots or more than three (3) dwelling units or that serves any nonresidential use tending to generate traffic equivalent to more than three (3) dwelling units is located along a lot boundary, then: 
(1)  If the lot is not also bordered by a public street, buildings and freestanding signs shall be set back from the boundary line of the private road just as if such road were a public street. 
(2)  If the lot is also bordered by a public street, then the setback distance on lots used for residential purposes (as set forth above in the column labeled "Minimum Distance from Side Lot Boundary Line") shall be measured from the inside boundary of the travelled portion of the private road. 
(e)  If a vacant lot of record, or lot of record that becomes vacant, is adjacent to a lot where an existing dwelling is located which is constructed less than the required minimum front yard setback, the required minimum front yard setback for the vacant lot shall not be less than the existing front yard setback for the adjacent dwelling. In cases where existing dwellings are located on both sides of the vacant lot and each is constructed less than the required minimum front yard setback, the required minimum front yard setback for the vacant lot shall not be less than the average of the two (2) existing dwellings. 
(f)  In residential districts, no structure of any type, size or configuration shall be constructed or be allowed closer than twenty (20) feet to a side property line when the side property line abuts a street. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 6-8-92) 
Section 185. - Accessory Building Setback Requirements. 
    All accessory buildings in residential districts (i.e., those established by Section 135) must comply with the street right-of-way and side lot boundary setbacks set forth in Section 184 but (subject to the remaining provisions of this subsection) shall be required to observe only a five-foot setback from side lot boundary lines and a three-foot setback from rear lot boundary lines. 
    Where the high point of the roof or any appurtenance of an accessory building exceeds twenty (20) feet in height, the accessory building shall comply with setback restrictions applicable to the principal building. 
Section 186. - Building Height Limitations. 
(a)  For purposes of this section: 
(1)  The height of a building shall be the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade at the front of the building to the highest point of the building. 
(2)  A point of access to a roof shall be the top of any parapet wall or the lowest point of a roof's surface, whichever is greater. Roofs with slopes greater than seventy-five (75) percent are regarded as walls. 
(b)  Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, building height limitations in the various zoning districts shall be as follows: 
Zone Height Limitations AR-20 35 feet RA-20 35 feet RA-12 35 feet RA-8 35 feet, except no height limitations for multifamily dwellings RA-6 35 feet, except no height limitations for multifamily dwellings MHP 35 feet B-1 None B-2 35 feet B-3 35 feet OI 35 feet I-1 None, except 40 feet when within 100 feet of a residential district I-2 None, except 40 feet when within 100 feet of a residential district  
(c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the following features are exempt from the district height limitations set forth in Subsection (b): 
(1)  Chimneys, antennas, church spires, water tanks, elevator shafts, scenery lofts, and similar structural appendages not intended as places of occupancy or storage; 
(2)  Flagpoles and similar devices; 
(3)  Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors, and similar equipment, fixtures and devices. 
(d)  The features listed in Subsection (c) are exempt from the height limitations set forth in subsection (b) if they conform to the following requirements: 
(1)  Not more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the total roof area may be consumed by such features. 
(2)  The features described in subdivision (c)(3) above must be set back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one (1) foot for every foot by which such features extend above the roof surface of the principal building to which they are attached. 
(3)  The permit-issuing authority may authorize or require that parapet walls be constructed (up to a height not exceeding that of the features screened) to shield the features listed in subdivisions (c)(1) and (3) from view. 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (b), in any zoning district the vertical distance from the ground to a point of access to a roof surface of any nonresidential building or any multifamily residential building containing four (4) or more dwelling units may not exceed thirty-five (35) feet unless the fire chief certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such building is designed to provide adequate access for fire-fighting personnel, or the building inspector certifies that the building is otherwise designed or equipped to provide adequate protection against the dangers of fire. 
Section 187. - Cluster Subdivisions. 
(a)  In any single-family residential subdivision in the zones indicated below, a developer may create lots that are smaller than those required by Section 181 if such developer complies with the provisions of this section and if the lots so created are not smaller than the minimums set forth in the following table: 
Zone Minimum Square Feet RA-20 15,000 RA-12  9,000 RA-8   6,000 RA-6   4,500  
(b)  The intent of this section is to authorize the developer to decrease lot sizes and leave the land "saved" by so doing as usable open space, thereby lowering development costs and increasing the amenity of the project without increasing the density beyond what would be permissible if the land were subdivided into the size of lots required by Section 181. 
(c)  The amount of usable open space that must be set aside shall be determined by: 
(1)  Subtracting from the standard square footage requirement set forth in Section 181 the amount of square footage of each lot that is smaller than that standard; 
(2)  Adding together the results obtained in (1) for each lot. 
(d)  The provisions of this section may only be used if the usable open space set aside in a subdivision comprises at least ten thousand (10,000) square feet of space that satisfies the definition of usable open space set forth in Section 198 and if such usable open space is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of Article XIII. 
(e)  The setback requirements of Sections 184 and 185 shall apply in cluster subdivisions. 
Section 188. - Structurally Integrated Subdivisions. 
(a)  In any structurally integrated subdivision, the developer may create lots and construct buildings without regard to any minimum lot size, lot width, or setback restrictions except that: 
(1)  Lot boundary setback requirements shall apply where and to the extent that the subdivided tract abuts land that is not part of the subdivision; and 
(2)  Each lot must be of sufficient size and dimensions that it can support the structure proposed to be located on it, consistent with all other applicable requirements of this chapter [appendix]. 
(b)  The number of dwelling units in a structurally integrated subdivision may not exceed the maximum density authorized for the tract under Section 182. 
(c)  To the extent reasonably practicable, in residential subdivisions the amount of land "saved" by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set forth in Section 181 shall be set aside as usable open space. 
(d)  The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public health and safety and without increasing overall density, to the developer who subdivides property and constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with a unified and coherent plan of development. 
Section 189. - Density on Lots Where Portion Dedicated to Town. 
(a)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, if any portion of a tract lies within an area designated on any officially adopted town plan as part of a proposed public park, greenway, or bikeway, and before the tract is developed, the owner of the tract, with the concurrence of the town, dedicates to the town that portion of the tract so designated, then, when the remainder of the tract is developed for residential purposes, the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(b)  If the proposed use of the remainder is a single-family detached residential subdivision, then the lots in such subdivision may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Sections 187 and 188, except that the developer need not set aside usable open space to the extent that an equivalent amount of land has previously been dedicated to the town in accordance with Subsection (a). 
(c)  If the proposed use of the remainder is a two-family or multifamily project, then the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated by regarding the dedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part of the lot proposed for development. 
(d)  If the portion of the tract that remains after dedication, as provided in Subsection (a), is divided in such a way that the resultant parcels are intended for future subdivision or development, then each of the resultant parcels shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the "density bonus" provided for in Subsections (b) and (c). 
Sections 190-195. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIII. - RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE 

Section 196. - Miniparks Required. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (c), all residential developments shall provide (through dedication or reservation, see Sections 199 and 200) recreational areas in the form of miniparks (as described in Section 197) in an amount equal to .0025 acres (108.9 square feet) per person expected to reside in that development (as determined in accordance with Subsection (b)). Such recreational areas shall be provided in addition to the open space areas required by Section 198. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, one-bedroom dwelling units shall be deemed to house an average of one and four tenths (1.4) persons; two-bedroom units, two and two tenths (2.2) persons; three-bedroom units, three and two tenths (3.2) persons; and units with four (4) or more bedrooms, four and zero tenths (4.0) persons. In residential subdivisions that are not approved as structurally integrated subdivisions, each lot that is large enough for only a single dwelling unit shall be deemed to house an average of three and two tenths (3.2) persons. Each lot that is large enough to accommodate more than one (1) dwelling unit shall be deemed to house two and two tenths (2.2) persons for each dwelling unit that can be accommodated. 
(c)  The council recognizes that miniparks must be of a certain minimum size to be usable and that such miniparks will not serve the intended purpose unless properly maintained. Therefore, residential developments that are small enough so that the amount of required minipark space does not exceed two thousand (2,000) square feet are exempt from the provisions of this section. However, as used in the foregoing sentence, the term "development" refers to the entire project developed on a single tract or contiguous multiple tracts under common ownership, regardless of whether the development is constructed in phases or stages. In addition, subdivided residential developments of less than twenty-five (25) dwelling units shall also be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
Section 197. - Miniparks: Purpose and Standards. 
(a)  The purpose of the minipark is to provide adequate active recreational facilities to serve the residents of the immediately surrounding neighborhood within the development. The following are illustrative of the types of facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs, and therefore to count toward satisfaction of the minipark requirements of this article: Tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms, meeting or activity rooms within clubhouses, basketball courts, swings, slides, and play apparatus. 
(b)  Each development shall satisfy its minipark requirement by installing the types of recreational facilities that are most likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of persons likely to reside in that development. However, unless it appears that less than five (5) percent of the residents of any development are likely to be children under twelve (12), then at least fifteen (15) percent of the minipark must be satisfied by the construction of "tot lots" (i.e., areas equipped with imaginative play apparatus oriented to younger children, as well as seating accommodations for parents). 
(c)  The total acreage of miniparks required by Section 196 shall be divided into miniparks of not less than two thousand (2,000) square feet, nor more than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. 
(d)  Miniparks shall be attractively landscaped and shall be provided with sufficient natural or manmade screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent residences. 
(e)  Each minipark shall be centrally located and easily accessible so that it can be conveniently and safely reached and used by those persons in the surrounding neighborhood it is designed to serve. 
(f)  Each minipark shall be constructed on land that is relatively flat, dry, and capable of serving the purposes intended by this article. 
Section 198. - Usable Open Space. 
(a)  Every multifamily residential and manufactured home park development shall be developed so that at least five (5) percent of the total area of the development remains permanently as usable open space. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, usable open space means an area that: 
(1)  Is not encumbered with any substantial structure; 
(2)  Is not devoted to use as a roadway, parking area, or sidewalk; 
(3)  Is left in its natural or undisturbed state (as of the date development began), if wooded, except for the cutting of trails for walking or jogging, or, if not wooded at the time of development, is landscaped for ballfields, picnic areas, or similar facilities, or is properly vegetated and landscaped with the objective of creating a wooded area or other area that is consistent with the objective set forth in subdivision (4); 
(4)  Is capable of being used and enjoyed for purposes of informal and unstructured recreation and relaxation; and 
(5)  Is legally and practicably accessible to the residents of the development out of which the required open space is taken, or to the public if dedication of the open space is required pursuant to Section 200. 
(6)  Consists of land no more than twenty-five (25) percent of which lies within an area of special flood hazard or a floodway as those terms are defined in Section 251. 
Section 199. - Ownership and Maintenance of Recreational Areas and Required Open Space. 
(a)  Except as provided in Section 200, or unless the town agrees to accept the dedication, recreation facilities and usable open space required to be provided by the developer in accordance with this article shall not be dedicated to the public but shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or his successor) or a homeowners association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria established in Section 203. 
(b)  The person or entity identified in Subsection (a) as having the right of ownership and control over such recreational facilities and open space shall be responsible for the continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of the same. 
Section 200. - Dedication of Open Space. 
(a)  If any portion of any lot proposed for multifamily residential or manufactured home park development lies within an area designated on the officially adopted recreation master plan as a neighborhood park or part of the greenway system or bikeway system, the area so designated (not exceeding five (5) percent of the total lot area) shall be included as part of the area set aside to satisfy the requirement of Section 198. This area shall be dedicated to public use. 
(b)  If more than five (5) percent of a lot proposed for multifamily residential or manufactured home park development lies within an area designated as provided in Subsection (a), the town may attempt to acquire the additional land in the following manner: 
(1)  The developer may be encouraged to resort to the procedures authorized in Sections 187 or 188 and to dedicate the common open space thereby created; or 
(2)  The town may purchase or condemn the land. 
(c)  An executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the Town of Tarboro shall be submitted to the town within thirty (30) working days of the approval by the town council of a subdivision plat or development plan. 
Section 201. - Payments in Lieu of Dedication. 
(a)  Any developer required to dedicate land pursuant to this article or any developer wishing to make a dedication rather than developing minipark recreational space as required in Section 196, with the approval of the town council, may make a payment in lieu of such dedication, or may make combination dedication and partial payment in lieu of dedication, whichever, in the opinion of the town council, shall be in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served. 
(b)  Any such payment in lieu of dedication shall be the product of the number of acres to be dedicated multiplied by the average fair market value of the land being subdivided at the time of the submission of the final subdivision plat or, in the case of a planned development, the final development plan. 
(c)  In case of a disagreement between the town and the developer as to the fair market value, such determination shall be made by a special appraisal committee made up of one (1) professional appraiser appointed by the town manager, one (1) professional appraiser appointed by the developer, and one (1) professional appraiser appointed by the initial two (2) committee appointees. The committee shall view the land and hear the contentions of both the town and the developer. The findings of the committee shall be by a majority vote and shall be certified to the town council in writing within thirty (30) days of the time of appointment of the third member of the committee. The costs of all professional land appraisers shall be borne entirely by the developer. (A professional appraiser is an individual who can show by legal credentials and experience that he or she has a knowledge of land appraisals of a similar type.) 
(d)  All monies received by the town pursuant to this section shall be used only for the acquisition or development of recreational and park sites benefitting the new development and the residents in the vicinity of the development. 
Section 202. - Procedure for Requesting Payment in Lieu of Dedication of Land. 
(a)  The developer shall attach to the subdivision plat, or in the case of a planned development, the preliminary development plan, a letter requesting approval to make payment in lieu of dedication of land pursuant to this article. In this letter, the developer shall state the proposed per acre value and include, in writing, the basis for determination of this value. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the subdivision plat, or in the case of a planned development, the preliminary development plan, the administrator shall submit a copy thereof with attached letter requesting approval to make payment in lieu of dedication to the town manager at least twenty (20) working days prior to the town council's next scheduled meeting. The town manager shall submit any and all recommendations concerning payment in lieu of dedication to the town council at its next scheduled meeting following review by the town manager. 
(c)  Upon approval by the town council, payment in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of final plat submittal or within one (1) year of the approval of the final development plan, except as otherwise approved by the town council. 
Section 203. - Homeowners Associations. 
    Homeowners associations or similar legal entities that, pursuant to Section 199, are responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas, including recreational facilities and open space, shall be established in such a manner that: 
(1)  Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity is made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied; 
(2)  The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over such common areas and facilities; 
(3)  The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel contributions from residents of the development to cover their proportionate shares of the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common areas and facilities. 
Section 204. - Flexibility in Administration Authorized. 
(a)  The requirements set forth in this article concerning the amount, size, location and nature of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the council as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted town plans. The council recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit-issuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and because of peculiarities in the developer's tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards. 
(b)  Whenever the permit-issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this article pursuant to Subsection (a), the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation. 
Section 205. - Authority to Sell. 
    The town council shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this article with the proceeds of any such sale used solely for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites. 
Section 206. - Land Acceptance. 
    The town council shall have the authority to accept or reject land dedications made as a requirement of this article. At the developer's request, the town council may accept a land dedication located elsewhere in the town's jurisdiction in lieu of a land dedication at the site of the proposed development.

ARTICLE XIV. - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 

Section 210. - Street Classification. 
(a)  In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in Subsection (b). 
(1)  The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day; 
(2)  The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive; 
(3)  Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision, or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision. 
(b)  The classification of streets shall be as follows: 
(1)  Residential: A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve no more than twenty-five (25) dwelling units and is expected to or does handle up to two hundred (200) trips per day. 
(2)  Cul-de-sac: A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around and which complies with the requirements of Subsection 217(b) and (c). 
(3)  Subcollector: A street whose principal function is to provide access to abutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to connect minor and residential streets with collector or arterial streets. Including residences indirectly served through connecting streets, it serves or is designed to serve at least twenty-six (26) but not more than one hundred (100) dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between two hundred (200) and eight hundred (800) trips per day. 
(4)  Collector: A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor, residential and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve, directly or indirectly, more than one hundred (100) dwelling units and is designed to be used or is used to carry more than eight hundred (800) trips per day. 
(5)  Arterial: A major street in the town's street system that serves as an avenue for the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the town and carries high volumes of traffic. Arterial streets are further classified as minor thoroughfares, major thoroughfares, or freeways according to the town's adopted thoroughfare plan. 
(6)  Marginal access street: A street that is parallel to and adjacent to an arterial street and that is designed to provide access to abutting properties so that these properties are somewhat sheltered from the effects of the through traffic on the arterial street, and so that the flow of traffic on the arterial street, is not impeded by direct driveway access from a large number of abutting properties. 
Section 211. - Access to Lots. 
    Every lot shall have access to a street so as to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use. 
    All lots shall front upon a public or approved private street, except as provided below, and shall conform with the minimum standards or dimensions contained herein. A maximum of three (3) subdivision lots may be allowed with frontage on a perpetual easement provided that: 
(a)  The perpetual easement is not less than twenty (20) feet in width and connects to a public road; 
(b)  Proof of the permanence of the easement is submitted prior to final plat approval; 
(c)  Restrictive covenants prohibiting further re-subdivision of the individual lots are recorded with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds prior to final plat approval; 
(d)  Each subdivision lot contains at least five (5) acres in land area; and 
(e)  Each subdivision lot is zoned AR-20. 
Section 212. - Access to Arterial Streets. 
    Subdivisions shall not be approved that propose individual residential lots with direct vehicular access to roads that have, in the opinion of the NCDOT and/or the Development Review Committee, capacity deficiencies or traffic safety concerns warrant the prohibition of the platting of lots with direct vehicular access. 
(Ord. No. 03-03, § 1, 2-10-03) 
Section 213. - Entrances to Streets. 
(a)  All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the town's planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that: 
(1)  Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles travelling in abutting streets; and 
(2)  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized. 
(b)  A driveway permit, issued by the town's building inspector, is required prior to the installation of a driveway. All driveways must conform to the town's specification for driveways (see Appendix C) and Article III of Chapter 16 of the Town of Tarboro Code of Ordinance. 
Section 214. - [Subdivisions with 20 or more lots; ingress and egress requirements.] 
    To the extent feasible, subdivisions containing twenty (20) or more lots shall have at least two (2) means of ingress and egress from a public street so as to afford emergency and maintenance vehicles reasonable access to the properties in the subdivision. If such access is not feasible at the time the subdivision is developed but may become feasible at a later date when adjoining property is developed, then the street system serving the subdivision shall be extended to the property line of the tract that is being subdivided at the point where a future connection is anticipated so that a second point of access can be provided at a later time. 
(Ord. No. 01-12, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Section 215. - Street Grades. 
(a)  The maximum and minimum grades at any point on a street shall be as detailed in The Manual of Standard Design, Details and Specifications (Appendix B).

(c)  The town council may require the construction of sidewalks adjacent to one (1) side of new streets in subdivisions in which pedestrian traffic is projected to be heavy due to the proximity of schools, parks, open space, playgrounds, or other community or private facilities. The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least four (4) feet in width and constructed according to the specifications set forth in Appendix B. 
Section 217. - General Layout of Streets. 
(a)  To the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards. 
(b)  All permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets) shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth in Subsection (c). Except where no other practicable alternative is available, as determined by the town engineer, such streets shall be designed so as to extend no more than eight hundred (800) feet as measured to the center of the turnaround. 
(c)  The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac turnaround shall have a radius of fifty (50) feet. The radius of the paved portion of the turnaround (measured to the outer edge of the pavement) shall be thirty-five (35) feet, and the pavement width shall be twenty-two (22) feet without curb and gutter or twenty-eight (28) feet with curb and gutter. Any unpaved center of the turnaround area shall be landscaped. 
Section 218. - Reserved. 
Section 219. - Construction Standards and Specifications. 
    Construction and design standards and specifications for streets, sidewalks, and curbs and gutters are contained in Appendix B, Town of Tarboro Manual of Standard Design, Details, and Specifications; and all such facilities shall be completed in accordance with these standards. 
Section 220. - Private Streets and Private Roads in Subdivisions. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date of this section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in Section 211. For purposes of this subsection, the term "public street" includes a pre-existing public street, as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the public street standards of this chapter [appendix] and is dedicated for public use. Unless the recorded plat of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private, the recording of such a plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street. 
(b)  Subdivisions may be developed with private roads so long as: 
(1)  The private roads are built to the same street construction standards and specifications as public streets; 
(2)  The proposed development will have direct access onto a public street or, if the tract has access to a public street only via a private road, such private road is improved to public street standards; 
(3)  No road intended to be private is planned to be extended to serve property outside of that development; 
(4)  The subdivider demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the council that the private roads will be properly maintained by a property owner's association or similar maintenance procedure; and 
(5)  The standards applicable to unsubdivided development set forth in Sections 221 and 222 are complied with. 
(c)  No final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notations as well as the disclosure statement required in Section 80(6): 
(1)  "Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road may be prohibited by the Tarboro Land Development Ordinance." 
(2)  "The policy of the Town of Tarboro is that, if the town improves streets (i) that were never constructed to the standards required in the Tarboro Land Development Ordinance for dedicated streets, and (ii) on which 75% of the dwelling units were constructed after the effective date of this chapter, then 100% of the costs of such improvements shall be assessed to abutting landowners." 
(3)  "The maintenance of all private streets and roads shown on this plat shall be the responsibility of property owners of lots within this subdivision. The Town of Tarboro will not maintain any private street or road." 
(d)  The recorded plat of any subdivision that includes a private road shall clearly state that such road is a private road. Further, the initial purchaser of a newly created lot served by a private road shall be furnished by the seller with a disclosure statement, in accordance with the provisions of G.S. Section 136-102.6, outlining the maintenance responsibilities for the road. 
Section 221. - Road and Sidewalk Requirements in Unsubdivided Developments. 
(a)  Within unsubdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving specifications shall be determined by the provisions of the chapter [appendix] dealing with parking (Article XVIII) and drainage (Article XVI). To the extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing articles, and to the extent that the requirements set forth in this article for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in unsubdivided developments, the requirements of this article may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth in the first sentence of this subsection. 
(b)  Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two (2) or more collector or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in unsubdivided developments within the town are constructed in accordance with the specifications for subdivision streets, the town may accept an offer of dedication of such streets. 
(c)  In all unsubdivided residential developments, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, sidewalks shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a road that serves not more than nine (9) dwelling units. The sidewalk requirement may also be waived where, in the opinion of the administrator, an adequate system of hiking and/or bicycling trails are provided which would offer acceptable pedestrian facilities and access. 
(d)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten (10) feet to provide such access. 
(e)  The sidewalks required by this section shall be constructed according to the specifications set forth in Appendix B. 
Section 222. - Attention to Handicapped in Street and Sidewalk Construction.

(b)  Street names shall include a suffix such as the following: 
(1)  Circle: A short street that returns to itself. 
(2)  Court or place: A cul-de-sac or dead-end street. 
(3)  Loop: A street that begins at the intersection with one (1) street and circles back to end at another intersection with the same street. 
(4)  Street, avenue, drive, boulevard and other common suffixes not applying above: All public streets not designated by another suffix. 
(c)  Building numbers shall be assigned by the town. 
Section 224. - Bridges.

ARTICLE XV. - UTILITIES 

Section 236. - Utility Ownership and Easement Rights. 
(a)  In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, sewer, electrical power, telephone, or cable television facilities and intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated or maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the developer, the developer shall transfer to such utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the utility or entity to operate and maintain such facilities. In addition, the developer, in accordance with Section 247, shall dedicate sufficient easement rights to accommodate the extension of utility facilities which will serve adjacent or nearby developments. 
(b)  The developer shall provide a minimum fifteen (15) foot cleared utility easement or width that would be sufficient as determined by the administrator to accommodate such facilities immediately adjacent and parallel to the street right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1, 8-13-01) 
Section 237. - Lots Served by Governmentally Owned Water or Sewer Lines. 
(a)  All lots within the Town of Tarboro corporate limits shall be served by a public water and sewer system. 
(b)  Water and sewer improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the town's Manual of Standard Design, Details, and Specifications (see Appendix B). 
Section 238. - Sewage Disposal Facilities Required. 
    Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a sewage disposal system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that complies with all applicable health regulations. 
Section 239. - Determining Compliance With Section 238. 
(a)  Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 238 often lies with an agency other than the town, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed sewage disposal system, the authority issuing a permit under this section may rely upon a preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage disposal system to determine compliance with Section 238. However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency. 
(b)  In the following table, the column on the left describes the type of development and the column on the right indicates the agency that must certify to the town whether the proposed sewage disposal system complies with the standard set forth in Section 238. 
If Then (1) The use is located on a lot that is served by the town sewer system or a previously approved, privately-owned package treatment plant, and the use can be served by a simple connection to the system (as in the case of a single-family residence) rather than the construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex): No further certification is necessary. (2) The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot that is served by the town sewer system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and a. The internal collection system is to be transferred to and maintained by the town: The Division of Environmental Management (DEM) must certify to the town that the proposed internal collection system meets the town's specifications and will be accepted by the town. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from the Division of Environmental Management.) b. The internal collection system is to be privately maintained: The public work director must certify that the proposed collection system is adequate. (3) The use (other than a subdivision) is not served by the town system but is to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (that has not previously been approved) with three thousand (3,000) gallons or less design capacity, the effluent from which does not discharge to surface water: The County Health Department (CHD) must certify to the town that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations. If the proposed use is a single dwelling other than a manufactured home, the developer must obtain an improvements permit from the CHD. If the proposed use is a single-family manufactured home, the developer must present to the town a certificate of completion from the CHD. (4) The use (other than a subdivision) is to be served by a privately operated sewage system (not previously approved) that has a design capacity of more than three thousand (3,000) gallons or that discharges effluent into surface waters: The Division of Environmental Management must certify to the town that the proposed system complies with all applicable state regulations. (A "permit to construct" and a "permit to discharge" must be obtained from DEM.) (5) The proposed use is a subdivision; and a. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by simple connection to existing town lines or lines of a previously approved private system: No further certification is necessary. b. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by the town system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to the town system: The public works director must certify to the town that the proposed system meets the town's specifications an will be accepted by the town. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from the Division of Environmental Management of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources.) c. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a sewage treatment system that has not been approved, that has a design capacity of three thousand (3,000) gallons or less, and that does not discharge into surface waters: The County Health Department must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations. If each lot within the subdivision is to be served by a separate on-site disposal system, the CHD must certify that each lot shown on a major subdivision preliminary plat can probably be served, and each lot on a major and minor subdivision final plat can be served by an on-site disposal system. d. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (not previously approved) that has a design capacity in excess of three thousand (3,000) gallons or that discharges effluent into surface waters: The Division of Environmental Management must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state regulations. (A "permit to construct" and a "permit to discharge" must be obtained from DEM.)  
Section 240. - Water Supply System Required. 
    Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a water supply system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that complies with all applicable health regulations. 
Section 241. - Determining Compliance with Section 240. 
(a)  Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 240 often lies with an agency other than the town, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed water supply system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter [appendix] may rely upon a preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed water supply system to determine compliance with Section 240. However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency. 
(b)  In the following table, the column on the left describes the type of development and the column on the right indicates the agency that must certify to the town whether the proposed water supply system complies with the standard set forth in Section 240: 
If Then (1) The use is located on a lot that is served by the town water system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system and the use can be served by a simple connection to the system (as in the case of a single family residence) rather than the construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex): No further certification is necessary. (2) The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot that is served by the town water system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and a. The internal distribution system is to be transferred to and maintained by the town: The Division of Health Services (DHS) must certify to the town that the proposed internal distribution system meets town specifications and will be accepted by the town. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from the Division of Health Services.) b. The internal distribution system is to be privately maintained: The public works director must certify that the proposed collection system is adequate. (3) The use (other than a subdivision is located on a lot not served by the town system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system; and a. The use is to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved; The Division of Health Services must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from DHS.) The Division of Environmental Management must also approve the plans if the water source is a well and the system has a design capacity of one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons per day or is located in certain areas designated by DEM. The public works director must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the town system. b. The use is to be served by some other source (such as an individual well): The County Health Department must certify that the proposed system meets all applicable state and local regulations. (4) The proposed use is a subdivision; and a. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by simple connection to existing town lines or lines of a previously approved public water supply system: No further certification is necessary. b. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by the town system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to such system: The public works director must certify to the town that the proposed system meets town specifications and will be accepted by the town. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from the Division of Health Services.) c. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved: The Division of Health Services must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. (A "permit to construct" must be obtained from DHS.) The Division of Environmental Management must also approve the plans if the water source is a well and the system has a design capacity of one hundred thousand (100,000) per day or is located within certain areas designated by DEM. The public works director must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the town system. d. Lots within the subdivision are to be served by individual wells: The County Health Department must certify to the town that each lot intended to be served by a well can be served in accordance with applicable health regulations.  
Section 242. - Lighting Requirements. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b), all public streets, sidewalks, and other common areas or facilities in subdivisions created after the effective date of this chapter [appendix] shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such streets, sidewalks, and other common areas or facilities. 
(b)  To the extent that fulfillment of the requirement established in Subsection (a) would normally require street lights installed along public streets, this requirement shall be applicable only to subdivisions located within the corporate limits of the town. Street lights shall be placed at each intersection and at such block spacing as may be required by the director of the electrical department. 
(c)  All roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities in unsubdivided developments shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities.

(a)  The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures, and 
(b)  If the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with Section 254(e)(2), the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed. 
(4)  Where the base flood elevation data are not provided, the application for a permit must show construction of the lowest floor at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(5)  Where any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development, the application for a permit shall include: a description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; an engineering report on the effects of the proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties located both upstream and downstream; and a map showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation. 
(6)  When a structure is floodproofed, the applicant shall provide a certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure meets the floodproofing criteria in Section 254(e)(2). 
(7)  A floor elevation or floodproofing certification is required after the lowest floor is completed. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of establishment of the lowest floor elevation, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, or floodproofed elevation, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work done within the twenty-one-day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The administrator shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

(Ord. No. 04-13, § 1, 12-6-04) 
Section 258. - Reserved. 
Section 259. - Location of Boundaries of Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
    As used in this article, the term areas of special flood hazard refers in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of this term. This term also refers to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries are the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard shown on the map referenced in Subsections 251(15) and (16), which boundaries are intended to correspond to the actual, physical location of areas of special flood hazard. (These overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy, rather than physical criteria.) Therefore, the administrator is authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the boundaries of areas of special flood hazards if there appears to be a conflict between a mapped bound and actual field conditions. Such interpretations, like other decisions of the administrator, may be appealed to the planning board in accordance with the applicable provisions of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 04-13, § 1, 12-6-04) 
Section 260. - Amendments to the Official Flood Hazard Zoning, Flood Hazard Boundary Map, Variance Procedures. 
(a)  Amendments to the official flood hazard zoning and flood hazard boundary map. 
(1)  All requests for revisions of areas of special flood hazard boundaries and base flood elevations shall be reviewed and approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(2)  The existing location of any area of special flood hazard as hereinabove defined may be amended in cases where: 
(a)  A flood control project of the federal, state, county or town government has substantially altered the flood hazard; 
(b)  Flood data indicates that the boundaries of either of the areas as shown on the official flood boundary and floodway map are no longer correct; or 
(c)  A private individual, corporation, firm or town agency has submitted plans for a channel improvement or relocation requiring an amendment to the official flood hazard boundary map. 
(b)  Variance procedures. 
(1)  In passing upon an application for a variance, the board of adjustment, as established by Section 29, shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and: 
(a)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(b)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(c)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(d)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(e)  The necessity of the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(f)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(g)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
(h)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(i)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(j)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and; 
(k)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the planning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local law or ordinances. 
(d)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(e)  The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in subsections 260(b)(1) and (2). 
(4)  In addition to the factors to be considered under Section 260(b)(1) and the conditions required by Section 260(b)(2), the board of adjustment may grant a variance to allow new solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, or chemical storage facilities only if the board finds that all four of the following have been satisfied: 
(i)  The use serves a critical need in the community; 
(ii)  No feasible location exists for the location of the use outside the 100-year floodplain; 
(iii)  The lowest floor of any structure is elevated above the base flood elevation or is designed to be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy; and 
(iv)  The use complies with all other applicable laws and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 04-13, § 1, 12-6-04) 
Section 261. - Regulations do not Guarantee Flood Protection. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulating purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. 
(Ord. No. 04-13, § 1, 12-6-04) 
Section 262. - Setbacks From Streams Outside Designated Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
    In an area that is located outside a designated area of special flood hazard but where a stream is located, no building or fill may be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five (5) times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or twenty (20) feet on each side, whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 2004-2755, § 1, 7-12-04) 
Section 262.1. - Acquisition of Existing Structures 
    The Town may acquire, by purchase, exchange, or condemnation an existing structure located in the 100-year floodplain or 500-year floodplain if the Town Council determines that the acquisition is necessary to prevent damage from flooding. The procedure in all condemnation proceedings pursuant to this section shall conform as nearly as possible to the procedure provided in G.S. § 40A, Article 3.

PART II. - DRAINAGE, EROSION CONTROL, STORM WATER MANAGEMENT 

Section 263. - Natural Drainage System Utilized to Extent Feasible. 
(a)  To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and preexisting manmade drainage ways shall remain undisturbed. 
(b)  To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting manmade drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainage ways. 
(Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Section 264. - Developments Must Drain Properly. 
(a)  All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface water shall not be regarded as unduly retained if: 
(1)  The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or 
(2)  The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its pre-development stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety. 
(b)  No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer. 
(c)  Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets. 
(d)  Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter and storm sewers in subdivisions is provided for in Section 216. Private roads and access ways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter and storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction. 
(e)  Construction specifications for drainage swales, curbs and gutters, and storm drains are contained in Appendix B. 
(Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Section 265. - Stormwater Management. 
(a)  The general standards contained in this section shall apply throughout the planning jurisdiction. However, developments located within watershed overlay districts shall comply with the applicable additional requirements of Sections 180.9, 267, 268, and 269. 
(b)  All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. More specifically: 
(1)  No development may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and 
(2)  No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties. 
(c)  All developments shall contain an adequate drainage system for the property drainage of all surface water. No new construction and no substantial improvements of a structure may take place unless the design of a drainage system is reviewed by the administrator to assure that: 
(1)  No surface water shall be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer. 
(2)  Where feasible, the subdivider shall connect to an existing storm drainage system. 
(3)  Where an existing storm drainage system cannot feasibly be extended to the subdivision, a surface drainage system shall be designed to protect the proposed development from water damage. 
(4)  Surface drainage courses shall have side slopes of not less than the natural angle of repose for the soil but not less than a three (3) to one (1) slope in which the course is constructed and courses shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the drainage area without flooding the adjacent properties. 
(5)  The proposed storm drainage system is consistent with the Town of Tarboro Manual of Standard Design, Details, and Specifications (see Appendix B). 
(d)  A drainage plan shall be required for any development or use of land except for land developed or used for agricultural purposes which involves or would create more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of impervious ground cover. No building permit will be issued for any such development until the drainage plan is approved by the town engineer. 
(e)  A drainage plan submitted for approval under these provisions must include but is not limited to the following information: a site plan showing existing and proposed buildings, storm drainage facilities and ground cover; site construction plans and grading plans and drainage system; drainage facility design data including a drainage area map, engineering calculations, area of impervious cover and total land area. 
(f)  A drainage plan submitted for approval under these provisions will be proposed and approved using the standards of the town engineer. 
(g)  Impervious cover, for purposes of this section, means any ground cover including asphalt, concrete, stone, brick terrazzo, roofing, clay tile or any other natural or manmade material that resists the absorption of surface water. 
(h)  The standards of this section do not apply to structures or impervious ground cover in existence prior to adoption of these provisions and these previously existing areas will not be used in calculating the twenty thousand (20,000) square feet used in (c) above. 
(i)  The town engineer will not approve a drainage plan if the impervious cover which would result would increase the storm water rate of runoff from the site unless measures are taken to control and limit the rate of runoff to the level which existed prior to the installation of the impervious cover. This determination will be based on the expected ten-year flood (a flood which could be expected to occur once in ten (10) years). The town engineer will waive the requirement for a drainage plan if the land being developed is part of a larger project which has received prior approval for and has implemented an overall drainage plan so long as the rate of runoff from the property presently under consideration does not exceed that which was previously approved. The town engineer may also waive any requirements for the detention of water when it would drain directly into land subject to the floodway regulations of the Town Code. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93; Ord. No. 96-10, § 1, 7-8-96; Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 8-11-97; Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Section 266. - Sedimentation and Erosion Control. 
(a)  No zoning, special use, or conditional use permit may be issued and final plat approval for subdivisions may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land disturbing activity requiring prior approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan by the N.C. Sedimentation Control Commission under G.S. 113A-57(4) unless the commission has certified to the town, either that: 
(1)  An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the commission; or 
(2)  The commission has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case, construction of the development may not begin (and no building permits may be issued) until the commission approves the erosion control plan. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, "land disturbing activity" means any use of the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development, highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation except activities that are exempt under G.S. 113A-52(6)). Sedimentation occurs whenever solid particulate matter, mineral or organic, is transported by water, air, gravity, or ice from the site of its origin. 
(c)  Except where a larger buffer area is required for developments located in Watershed Overlay Districts (Section 180.9(e)), all developments shall maintain a twenty-five-foot vegetated buffer along each side of a stream or natural drainageway. The twenty-five-foot distance shall be measured from the top edge of the streambank or drainageway. If no drainageway bank exists, the centerline of the drainageway swale shall be used for measurement purposes. The vegetated buffer shall remain undisturbed except as may be necessary to accommodate roads (provided they cross at a horizontal angle of at least sixty (60) degrees), utilities and their easements, pedestrian paths and their easements and approved water-dependent uses such as marinas, docks, piers, boat ramps and bridges. In cases in which a twenty-five-foot buffer may not be practical nor desirable, the Planning board may consider a special exception if it finds that an acceptable alternative means of handling stormwater can be achieved without maintaining a twenty-five-foot vegetated buffer. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93; Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01; Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04) 
Section 267. - Stormwater Control Structures. 
(a)  Developments located within WPA overlay districts that have been approved for the high density development option authorized in Section 180.9(i) shall comply with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  All stormwater control structures shall be designed by either a North Carolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect, to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow. Other stormwater systems shall be designed by a North Carolina registered professional with qualifications appropriate for the type of system required; these registered professionals are defined as professional engineers, landscape architects, to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A allow and land surveyors, to the extent that the design represents incidental drainage within a subdivision, as provided in General Statutes 89(C)-3(7). 
(c)  All stormwater controls shall use wet detention ponds as a primary treatment system. Wet detention ponds shall be designed for specific pollutant removal according to modeling techniques approved by the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management. Specific requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the following design criteria: 
1.  Wet detention ponds shall be designed to remove eighty-five (85) percent of total suspended solids in the permanent pool and storage runoff from a one (1) inch rainfall from the site above the permanent pool; 
2.  The designed runoff storage volume shall be above the permanent pool; 
3.  The discharge rate from these systems following the one (1) inch rainfall design storm shall be such that the runoff does not draw down to the permanent pool level in less than two (2) days and that the pond is drawn down to the permanent pool level within at least five (5) days; 
4.  The mean permanent pool depth shall be a minimum of three (3) feet; 
5.  The inlet structure shall be designed to minimize turbulence using baffles or other appropriate design features; 
6.  Vegetative filters shall be constructed for the overflow and discharge of all stormwater wet detention ponds and shall be at least thirty feet in length. The slope and width of the vegetative filter shall be determined so as to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow-through the filter for a ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm with a ten-year, one-hour intensity with a slope of five (5) percent or less. Vegetation in the filter shall be natural vegetation, grasses or artificially planted wetland vegetation appropriate for the site characteristics. 
(d)  In addition to the vegetative filters required in subsection (c)6., all land areas outside of the pond shall be provided with a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion within thirty (30) days after any land disturbance. Upon completion of the stormwater control structure, a permanent ground cover shall be established and maintained as part of the maintenance agreement described in Section 268(c). 
(e)  A description of the area containing the stormwater control structure shall be prepared and filed, consistent with Section 269(i) and (j), as a separate deed with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds along with any easements necessary for general access to the stormwater control structure. The deeded area shall include the detention pond, vegetative filters, all pipes and water control structures, berms, dikes, etc., and sufficient area to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs and reconstruction. 
(f)  Qualifying areas of the stormwater control structure may be considered pervious when computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one (1) site, it shall not be used to compute the built-upon area for any other site or area. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93; Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Section 268. - Financial Security for Stormwater Control Structures. 
(a)  All new stormwater control structures authorized in Section 180.9(i) shall be conditioned on the posting of adequate financial assurance for the purpose of maintenance, repairs or reconstruction necessary for adequate performance of the stormwater control structures. 
(b)  Financial assurance shall be in the form of the following: 
1.  Surety performance bond or other security. The permit applicant shall obtain either a performance bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in North Carolina, an irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value payable to the Town of Tarboro or placed in escrow with a financial institution designated as an official depository of the Town of Tarboro. The bond or other instrument shall be in an amount equal to one and twenty-five one hundredths (1.25) times the total cost of the stormwater control structure, as estimated by the town engineer and approved by the town council. The total cost of the stormwater control structure shall include the value of all materials such as piping and other structures; seeding and soil stabilization; design and engineering; and, grading, excavation, fill, etc. The costs shall not be prorated as part of a larger project, but rather under the assumption of an independent mobilization. 
2.  Cash or equivalent security deposited after the release of the performance bond. Consistent with Section 269(k)1., the permit applicant shall deposit with the Town of Tarboro either cash or other instrument approved by the town council that is readily convertible into cash at face value. The cash or security shall be in an amount equal to fifteen (15) percent of the total cost of the stormwater control structure or the estimated cost of maintaining the stormwater control structure over a ten-year period, whichever is greater. The estimated cost of maintaining the stormwater control structure shall be consistent with the approved operation and maintenance plan or manual provided by the developer under Section 269(a). The amount shall be computed by estimating the maintenance cost for twenty-five (25) years and multiplying this amount by two-fifths ( 2/5 ) or four-tenths (0.4). 
(c)  Consistent with Section 180.9(i), the permit applicant shall enter into a binding operation and maintenance agreement between the Town of Tarboro and all interests in the development. Said agreement shall require the owning entity to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the stormwater control structure in accordance with the operation and management plan or manual provided by the developer. The operation and maintenance agreement shall be filed with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds by the town engineer. 
(d)  Default under the performance bond or other security. Upon default of the permit applicant to complete and/or maintain the stormwater control structure as spelled out in the performance bond or other security, the council may obtain and use all or any portion of the funds necessary to complete the improvements based on an engineering estimate. The council shall return any funds not spent in completing the improvements to the owning entity. 
(e)  Default under the cash security. Upon default of the owning entity to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the stormwater control structure in accordance with the operation and maintenance agreement, the council shall obtain and use all or any portion of the cash security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after exhausting all other reasonable remedies seeking the owning entity to comply with the terms and conditions of the operation and maintenance agreement. The council shall not return any of the deposited cash funds. 
(Ord. No. 93-9, § 1, 6-7-93; Ord. No. 01-13, § 1, 7-9-01) 
Sec. 269. - Maintenance and Inspection of Stormwater Control Structures. 
(a)  An operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be provided by the developer for each stormwater control structure authorized in Section 180.9(i), indicating what operation and maintenance actions are needed, what specific quantitative criteria will be used for determining when those actions are to be taken and, consistent with the operation and maintenance agreement, who is responsible for those actions. The plan shall clearly indicate the steps that will be taken for restoring a stormwater control structure to design specifications if a failure occurs. 
(b)  Landscaping and grounds management shall be the responsibility of the owning entity. However, vegetation shall not be established or allowed to mature to the extent that the integrity of the control structure is diminished or threatened, or to the extent of interfering with any easement or access to the stormwater control structure. 
(c)  Except for general landscaping and grounds management, the owning entity shall notify the administrator prior to any repair or reconstruction of the stormwater control structure. All improvements shall be made consistent with the approved plans and specifications of the stormwater control structure and the operation and maintenance plan or manual. After notification by the owning entity, the town engineer shall inspect the completed improvements and shall inform the owning entity of any required additions, changes or modifications and of the time period to complete said improvements. The town engineer may consult with an engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A allow) designated by the town council. 
(d)  Amendments to the plans and specifications of the stormwater control structure and/or the operation and maintenance plan or manual shall be approved by the town council. Proposed changes shall be prepared by a North Carolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A allow) and submitted to and reviewed by the town engineer prior to consideration by the town council. 
1.  If the town council approves the proposed changes, the owning entity of the stormwater control structure shall file sealed copies of the revisions with the office of the town engineer. 
2.  If the town council disapproves the changes, the proposal may be revised and resubmitted to the town council as a new proposal. If the proposal has not been revised and is essentially the same as that already reviewed, it shall be returned to the applicant. 
(e)  If the town council finds that the operation and maintenance plan or manual is inadequate for any reason, the council shall notify the owning entity of any required changes and shall prepare and file copies of the revised agreement with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds, the office of the town engineer and the owning entity. 
(f)  Processing and inspection fees shall be submitted in the form of a check or money order made payable to the town. Applications shall be returned if not accompanied by the required fee. 
(g)  A permit and inspection fee schedule, as approved by the Tarboro Town Council shall be posted in the office of the town engineer. 
(h)  Inspection fees shall be valid for sixty (60) days. An inspection fee shall be required when improvements are made to the stormwater control structure consistent with subsection (c), except in the case when a similar fee has been within the last 60 days. 
(i)  The stormwater control structure shall be inspected by the town engineer, after the owning entity notifies the town engineer that all work has been completed. At this inspection, the owning entity shall provide: 
1.  The signed deed, related easements and survey plat for the stormwater control structure ready for filing with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds; 
2.  A certification sealed by an engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow) stating that the stormwater control structure is complete and consistent with the approved plans and specifications. 
(j)  The town engineer shall present the materials submitted by the developer and the inspection report and recommendations to the town council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
1.  If the council approves the inspection report and accepts the certification, deed and easements, the council shall file the deed and easements with the Edgecombe County Register of Deeds, release up to seventy-five (75) percent of the value of the performance bond or other security and issue an occupancy permit for the stormwater control structure, consistent with Sections 7 and 47. 
2.  If deficiencies are found, the council shall direct that improvements and inspections be made and/or documents corrected and resubmitted to the council. 
(k)  No sooner than one (1) year after the filing date of the deed, easements and maintenance agreement, the developer may petition the town council to release the remaining value of the performance bond or other security. Upon receipt of said petition, the town engineer shall inspect the stormwater control structure to determine whether the controls are performing as designed and intended. The town engineer shall present the petition, inspection report and recommendations to the town council. 
1.  If the council approves the report and accepts the petition, the developer shall deposit with the town council a cash amount equal to that described in Section 268(b)2. after which, the council shall release the performance bond or other security. 
2.  If the council does not accept the report and rejects the petition, the council shall provide the developer with instructions to correct any deficiencies and all steps necessary for the release the performance bond or other security. 
(l)  All stormwater control structures shall be inspected at least on an annual basis to determine whether the controls are performing as designed and intended. Records of inspection shall be maintained on forms approved or supplied by the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management. Annual inspections shall begin within one year of filing date of the deed for the stormwater control structure. 
(m)  In the event the town engineer discovers the need for corrective action or improvements, the town engineer shall notify the owning entity of the needed improvements and the date by which the corrective action is to be completed. All improvements shall be made consistent with the plans and specifications of the stormwater control structure and the operation and maintenance plan or manual. After notification by the owning entity, the town engineer shall inspect and approve the completed improvements. The town engineer may consult with an engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow) designated by the town council.

ARTICLE XVII. - SIGNS 

Section 270. - Purpose/Definitions. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to create a comprehensive system of signage within the Town of Tarboro and is further intended to facilitate an effective and attractive means of communication. It recognizes the need for an orderly and aesthetically pleasing community as well as the need for adequate business identification. This article regulates the use of signs in order to ensure that they are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in such a manner that they do not endanger the public safety and welfare, and that they are compatible with their surroundings. However, the regulations contained herein are designed to provide flexibility for the individual identification of businesses and services. 
(b)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article. 
(1)  Sign. Any device that is sufficiently visible to persons not located on the lot where such device is located to accomplish the objective of directing attention to a business, commodity, service, entertainment or other activity sold or offered exclusively on the premises where the sign is located; or communicating information to them. 
(2)  Freestanding sign. A sign that is attached to, erected on, or supported by some structure (such as a pole, mast, frame, or other structure) that is not itself an integral part of or attached to a building or other structure whose principal function is something other than the support of a sign. A sign that stands without supporting elements, such as "sandwich sign," is also a freestanding sign. 
(3)  Off-premises signs. A sign that draws attention to or communicates information about a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other activity that is conducted, sold or offered at a location other than the premises on which the sign is located. Such signs are not permitted except those specifically exempt in accordance with Section 272. 
(4)  Portable sign. A sign that is designed to be moved from place to place and which is not permanently installed. 
(5)  Temporary sign. A sign that is used in connection with a circumstance, situation, or event that is designed, intended or expected to take place or to be completed within a reasonably short or definite period after the erection of such sign; or is intended to remain on the location where it is erected or placed for a period of not more than thirty (30) days. If a sign display area is permanent but the message displayed is subject to periodic changes, that sign shall not be regarded as temporary. 
(6)  Nonconforming sign. See Section 129, Nonconforming Signs. 
(7)  Internally illuminated sign. A sign where the source of the illumination is inside the sign and light emanates through the message of the sign, rather than being reflected off the surface of the sign from an external source. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, signs that consist of or contain tubes that are filled with neon or some other gas that glows when an electric current passes through it and are intended to form or constitute all or part of the message of the sign, rather than merely providing illumination to other parts of the sign that contain the message, shall also be considered internally illuminated signs. 
(8)  Projecting sign. A sign which is attached to and projects more than twelve (12) inches from a building face or wall. 
(9)  Wall sign. Any sign attached to, painted on, or erected against any wall of a building or structure so that the exposed face of the sign is on a place parallel to the plane of said wall and which does not extend more than twelve (12) inches from the wall. Wall sign also includes any sign erected against, installed on or painted on a penthouse above the roof of a building as long as the wall of the penthouse is on a plane parallel to the wall of the building. Wall sign also includes a sign attached to, painted on, or erected against a false wall or false roof that does not vary more than thirty (30) degrees from the plane of the adjoining wall elevation. 
Section 271. - Permit Required for Signs. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 272 (Signs Excluded from Regulation) and 273 (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exceptions and Additional Regulations), no sign may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions of this section. Mere repainting or changing the message of a sign shall not, in and of itself, be considered a substantial alteration. 
(b)  If plans submitted for a zoning permit, special use permit, or conditional use permit include sign plans in sufficient detail that the permit-issuing authority can determine whether the proposed sign or signs comply with the provisions of this chapter [appendix], then issuance of the requested zoning, special use, or conditional use permit shall constitute approval of the proposed sign or signs. 
(c)  Signs not approved as provided in Subsection (b) or exempted under the provisions referenced in Subsection (a) may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered only in accordance with a sign permit issued by the administrator. 
(1)  Sign permit applications and sign permits shall be governed by the same provisions of this chapter [appendix] applicable to zoning permits. 
Section 272. - Signs Excluded From Regulation. 
    The following signs are exempt from regulation under this chapter except for those restrictions stated in Section 283: 
(a)  Off-premises signs. 
(1)  Signs erected by or on behalf of or pursuant to the authorization of a governmental body, including legal notices, identification and informational signs, and traffic, directional or regulatory signs. 
(2)  Official signs of a noncommercial nature erected by public utilities. 
(3)  Flags, pennants, or insignia of any governmental or nonprofit organization when not displayed in connection with a commercial promotion or as an advertising device. 
(4)  Where one (1) or more commercial business establishments are located on a "dead-end" street (i.e. the businesses have frontage only on a section of street that has but one (1) outlet), but the street was once an open through street at the time one (1) or more of such commercial establishments opened for business, then: 
a.  Subject to the remaining provisions of this subsection, a sign advertising the businesses on the dead-end street may be erected on private property that is commercially zoned and that abuts the right-of-way lines of the dead-end street and the nearest intersecting through street. 
b.  Only one (1) such sign shall be authorized for each such dead-end street. 
c.  A sign permit for a sign authorized by this subsection shall be issued in the name of the owner of the property where such sign is to be located. At least ten (10) days prior to submitting an application for such sign permit, the owner of the property where the sign is to be located shall mail or deliver written notice to each business owner on such dead-end street informing such business owner that the applicant intends to apply for a permit for such sign, that only one such sign may be permitted, and inviting each such business owner to contact the applicant if he or she wishes to advertise his or her business on such sign. The applicant shall submit with the application a written certification that such notification has been provided. 
d.  A sign authorized by the subsection may not exceed sixty-four (64) square feet in surface area per side, may have not more than two (2) sides, and is subject to the provisions of Sections 281 and 283. 
(b)  All other signs exempt. 
(1)  Signs not exceeding four (4) square feet in area that are customarily associated with residential use and that are not of a commercial nature, such as signs giving property identification names or numbers or names of occupants, signs on mailboxes or paper tubes, and signs posted on private property relating to private parking or warning the public against trespassing or danger from animals. 
(2)  Integral decorative or architectural features of buildings or works of art, so long as such features or works do not contain letters, trademarks, moving parts, or lights. 
(3)  Signs directing and guiding traffic on private property that do not exceed four (4) square feet each. 
(4)  Church bulletin boards and church identification signs that do not exceed sixteen (16) square feet in area. 
(5)  Signs painted on or otherwise permanently attached to currently licensed motor vehicles and trailers that are not primarily used as signs. 
(6)  Signs proclaiming religious, political, or other noncommercial messages (other than those regulated by Subdivision 273(a)(5)) that do not exceed one (1) per abutting street and sixteen (16) square feet in area. 
(7)  Signs located on the interior of buildings, courts, lobbies, stadiums, or other structures that are not intended to be seen from the exterior of said building or structure. 
(8)  Memorial and historical plaques or markers, except that those located in the historic district shall comply with the requirements of Section 168. 
(9)  Signs painted or attached to vending machines, gas pumps, ice machines, or similar devices which indicate the contents of the machine, the price, or operating instructions. 
(10)  Community civic association signs, identifying such community, which do no exceed eighteen (18) square feet in area. 
(Ord. No. 95-5, § 1, 3-6-95; Ord. No. 03-01, § 1, 1-13-03) 
Section 273. - Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations. 
(a)  The following temporary signs are permitted without a zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit. However, such signs shall conform to the requirements set forth below as well as all other applicable requirements of this chapter except those contained in Sections 276 (Total Sign Surface Area) and 279 (Number of Freestanding and Wall Signs). 
(1)  Signs containing the message that the real estate on which the sign is located (including buildings) is for sale, lease, or rent, together with information identifying the owner or agent. Such signs may not exceed four (4) square feet in area and shall be removed immediately after sale, lease, or rental. For lots of less than five (5) acres, a single sign on each street frontage may be erected. For lots of five (5) acres or more in area and having a street frontage in excess of four hundred (400) feet, a single sign not exceeding thirty-two (32) square feet in area may be erected on each street frontage. 
One directional sign not to exceed four (4) square feet shall be allowed off the subject premises. Such sign shall only be allowed with the permission of the owner whose property the sign is being placed and shall be located out of the right-of-way. The sign shall be removed immediately after sale, lease or rental. 
(2)  Construction site/opening soon identification signs. Such signs may identify the project, the owner or developer, architect, engineer, contractor and subcontractors, funding sources, and may contain related information. Not more than one (1) such sign may be erected per site, and it may not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area. Such signs shall not be erected prior to the issuance of a building permit and shall be removed within ten (10) days after the issuance of the final occupancy permit. One (1) "opening soon" sign may be permitted per building site provided such sign does not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area and is erected for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. 
(3)  Signs attached temporarily to the interior of a building window or glass door. Such signs, individually or collectively, may not cover more than seventy-five (75) percent of the surface area of the transparent portion of the window or door to which they are attached.

(4)  Displays, including lighting, erected in connection with the observance of holidays. Such signs shall be removed within ten (10) days following the holidays. 
(5)  Signs erected in connection with elections or political campaigns no earlier than forty-five (45) days prior to a national, state, or local political election and removed within ten (10) working days following the election. Such signs shall not exceed thirty-two (32) feet in area nor a height of fifteen (15) feet. Such signs may be placed on private property with no limit on the number of signs, provided they are not located in a public street right-of-way and are not attached to or placed on utility poles, trees, or traffic signals. 
(6)  Signs erected by or on behalf of Edgecombe County Human Services informing the public of the availability of public health services, so long as all such signs comply with each of the following restrictions: 
a.  The total number of such signs located within the town's planning jurisdiction at any one time may not exceed twenty-four (24); 
b.  Not more than one (1) such sign may be located on any lot; 
c.  Such signs may be placed on a lot only with the permission of the owner of such lot or a person in possession of such lot or one who is otherwise authorized to grant such permission; 
d.  No such sign may exceed four (4) square feet in surface area; 
e.  No such sign may remain on the same lot for a consecutive period of more than ninety (90) days. When such sign is removed, it may not be replaced with a sign authorized under this subsection (a)(6) for a period of at least sixty (60) days. 
f.  Prior to placing any sign authorized under this subsection (a)(6), Edgecombe County Human Services shall deposit with the town the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) to secure the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this subsection. Upon violation of any of these requirements, this security shall be forfeited, and all signs authorized by this subsection shall be considered in violation of this ordinance unless and until all such signs are made to conform to these requirements and an additional fifty dollars ($50.00) security is deposited with the town. 
(7)  Temporary signs not covered in the foregoing categories, so long as such signs meet the following restrictions: 
a.  Not more than one (1) such sign may be located on any lot. 
b.  No such sign may exceed four (4) square feet in surface area. 
c.  Such sign may not be displayed for longer than three (3) consecutive days nor more than ten (10) days out of any three hundred sixty-five-day period. 
(8)  Temporary special event signs or banners for religious, charitable, civic, fraternal or other nonprofit organizations: 
a.  No temporary special event sign or banner shall be placed on any lot without first filing an application and receiving approval from the planning director. 
b.  Those signs or banners not receiving proper approval from the planning director can be removed immediately. 
c.  No more than four (4) signs or banners shall be erected for a special event. 
d.  The maximum sign area shall be thirty-two (32) square feet. 
e.  All signs or banners shall be located on private property with the approval of the property owner and in no case shall be located within any road right-of-way. 
f.  Temporary special event signs and banners shall be permitted for no more than four (4) events per calendar year with a maximum time period for each event of fourteen (14) calendar days. 
(b)  Other temporary signs not listed in Subsection (a) shall be regarded and treated in all respects as permanent signs. 
(Ord. No. 11-03, § 1, 4-11-11; Ord. No. 14-06, § 2, 11-10-14; Ord. No. 15-01, § 2, 1-12-15; Ord. No. 15-02, § 2, 1-12-15) 
Section 274. - Determining the Number of Signs. 
(a)  For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements, each element shall be considered a single sign. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of Subsection (a), a multi-sided sign shall be regarded as one (1) sign. 
Section 275. - Computation of Sign Area. 
(a)  The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single, continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight (8) straight lines, or a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(b)  If the sign consists of more than one (1) section or module, all of the area, including that between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area. 
(c)  With respect to two-sided, multi-sided or three-dimensional signs, the surface area shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed either to attract attention or communicate information that can be seen at one time by any person from any vantage point. For example, with respect to a typical two-sided sign where a message is printed on both sides of a flat surface, the sign surface area of one (1) side (rather than the sum total of both sides) shall be regarded as the total sign surface area of that sign, since one can see only one (1) side of the sign from any vantage point. 
(d)  With respect to V-shaped signs, the surface area shall be calculated as in Subsection (c) above, provided the angle of the intersecting sign planes does not exceed ninety (90) degrees. If the angle of the intersecting sign planes exceeds ninety (90) degrees, sign area shall be computed as it would for a one-sided sign. 
Section 276. - Total Sign Surface Area. 
(a)  Unless otherwise provided in this article, the total surface area devoted to all signs on any lot shall not exceed the limitations set forth in this section, and all signs except temporary signs shall be included in this calculation. 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided in this article or in Article XI (Supplementary Use Regulations), the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in any residential district (see Section 135) is four (4) square feet. 
(c)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in an O and I district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the lot by zero and seventy-five one hundredths (0.75) feet. However, in no case may the total sign surface area exceed two hundred (200) square feet. 
(d)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in a B-1 district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of lot frontage by two and zero tenths (2.0) feet. However, in no case may the total sign surface area exceed three hundred (300) square feet. 
(e)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, the maximum sign surface area on any lot in the B-2, B-3, I-1, or I-2 districts shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the lot by two and zero tenths (2.0) feet. However, in no case may the total sign surface area exceed four hundred (400) square feet. 
(f)  If a lot has frontage on more than one (1) street, then the total sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street on which the lot has frontage. However, the total sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign surface area allocation that is derived from frontage on that street. 
(g)  Whenever a lot is situated such that it has no street frontage on any lot boundary and an applicant desires to install on such a lot a sign that is oriented toward a street, then the total sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sign surface area that would be allowed if the lot boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such street. The applicant shall be restricted to using only one (1) street and the closest lot boundary to this street for determining the total permitted sign surface area. However, the applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine the one (1) street used in the calculations. 
(h)  The total sign area delineated in this section may be allocated among the various types of permissible signs at the discretion of the sign permit applicant. However, the maximum sign area allocated to any one (1) particular type of sign is outlined in Sections 277 and 278. Therefore, the total sign area determined by this section may not be attained in some cases because of the sign area cap for individual freestanding or wall signs. For example, a use in the B-1 district with a one hundred-foot lot frontage and five hundred (500) square feet of building facade would be allowed a total sign area of two hundred (200) square feet (100 foot lot x 2.0 = 200 square feet). If the sign permit applicant chose to erect the maximum size of freestanding sign of thirty (30) square feet (100 foot x 0.3 = 30 square feet), only one hundred fifty (150) square feet of the remaining one hundred seventy (170) square feet (200 feet minus 30 feet) total permissible sign area could be allocated to a wall sign due to the cap on the maximum size of wall signs (500 foot building wall surface area x 30 percent = 150 square feet). Consequently, the limited amount of wall surface area in this case would prevent the total sign area from being attained. The amount of total permissible sign area not utilized for freestanding and wall signs could, however, be applied to other types of allowable signs. 
Section 277. - Freestanding Sign Surface Area. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in Section 275. For example, wall signs typically have one (1) side. Freestanding signs typically have two (2) sides (back-to-back), although four-sided and other multi-sided signs are also common. 
(b)  Subject to Subsections (c) and (e), a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed zero and three tenths (0.3) square feet in surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented. However, in no case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed fifty (50) square feet in surface area if the lot on which the sign is located has less than two hundred (200) feet of frontage on the street toward which that sign is primarily oriented, seventy-five (75) square feet on lots with two hundred (200) or more but less than four hundred (400) feet of frontage, and one hundred (100) square feet on lots with four hundred (400) or more feet of frontage. 
(c)  In the B-2, B-3, I-1, and I-2 districts, a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed one and zero tenths (1.0) square foot in sign surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented. However, in no case may a single side of such signs exceed two hundred fifty (250) square feet in surface area. 
(d)  With respect to freestanding signs that have no discernible "sides," such as spheres or other shapes not composed of flat planes, no such freestanding sign may exceed the maximum total surface area allowed under Subsections (b) or (c) for a single side of a freestanding sign. 
(e)  A single side of a freestanding sign that is located immediately adjacent to an interstate grade four lane limited access highway (which sign may extend to a height of seventy (70) feet-see Subsection 281(e)) may not exceed five hundred (500) square feet. 
(Ord. No. 97-5, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-97) 
Section 278. - Wall Sign Surface Area. 
(a)  The sign surface area on any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed thirty (30) percent of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located. 
(b)  Wall surface area is calculated by multiplying the vertical distance of the building wall (measured at the average finished grade) times the horizontal distance of the building wall. 
Section 279. - Number of Freestanding and Wall Signs. 
(a)  Except as authorized by this section, no development may have more than one (1) freestanding sign. 
(b)  If a development is located on a corner lot that has at least one hundred (100) feet of frontage on each of the two (2) intersecting public streets, then the development may have not more than one (1) freestanding sign along each side of the development bordered by such streets. 
(c)  If a development is located on a lot that is bordered by two (2) public streets that do not intersect at the lot's boundaries (double front lot), then the development may have not more than one (1) freestanding sign on each side of the development bordered by such streets. 
(d)  Only one (1) wall sign per establishment per street frontage is permissible. 
(e)  If a development is located on a lot that has at least two hundred and fifty (250) feet of street frontage, then that development may have two (2) freestanding signs that are a minimum of one hundred and fifty (150) feet apart. Developments that meet these requirements may have no more than five hundred (500) square feet of total sign surface area. 
(Ord. No. 99-1, § 1, 1-11-99) 
Section 280. - Subdivision, Multifamily Development and Manufactured Home Park Entrance Signs. 
    There shall be a maximum of sixty-four (64) feet of sign with a maximum of two (2) signs per entrance at no more than two (2) entrances in the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 01-20, § 1, 8-13-01) 
Section 281. - Location and Height Requirements. 
(a)  No freestanding sign shall extend closer than ten (10) feet to a street right-of-way line or property line. 
(b)  No sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof surface, except that for purposes of this section, roof surfaces constructed at an angle of seventy-five (75) degrees or more from horizontal shall be regarded as wall space. This subsection shall not apply to displays, including lighting, erected in connection with the observation of holidays on the roofs of residential structures. 
(c)  No wall sign attached flat to a building may project more than twelve (12) inches from the building wall. Projecting signs may, however, exceed the twelve-inch requirement. 
(d)  No sign or supporting structure may be located in or over the travelled portion of any public right-of-way unless the sign is attached to a structural element of a building and an encroachment permit has been obtained from the town. 
(e)  No part of a freestanding sign may exceed a height, measured from ground level, as indicated in the following table: 
 District Height (feet) All residential districts and uses 10 O and I 15 B-1 20 B-2 35 B-3 35  
Signs with a height of up to seventy (70) feet shall be allowed immediately adjacent to interstate grade four lane limited access highways. 
(f)  Regardless of the size of the sign, no sign may be located immediately adjacent to an interstate grade four lane limited access highway within five hundred (500) linear feet of another sign that is located on the same side of and immediately adjacent to such highway. 
(Ord. No. 96-12, § 1, 7-8-96; Ord. No. 97-5, § 3, 5-12-97) 
Section 282. - Sign Illumination and Signs Containing Lights. 
(a)  Unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter [appendix], signs may be illuminated if such illumination is in accordance with this section. 
(b)  No sign within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a residential zone may be illuminated between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m., unless the impact of such lighting beyond the boundaries of the lot where it is located is entirely inconsequential. 
(c)  Lighting directed toward a sign shall be shielded so that it illuminates only the face of the sign and does not shine directly into a public right-of-way or residential premises. 
(d)  Subject to Subsection (f), illuminated tubings or strings of lights that outline property lines, sales areas, roof lines, doors, windows, or similar areas are prohibited. 
(e)  Subject to Subsection (f), no sign may contain or be illuminated by flashing or intermittent lights or lights of changing degrees of intensity, except signs indicating the time, date or weather conditions. 
(f)  Subsections (d) and (e) do not apply to temporary signs erected in connection with the observance of holidays. 
Section 283. - Miscellaneous Restrictions and Prohibitions. 
(a)  No temporary nor permanent sign shall be attached to a tree or utility pole [other than signs allowed by Subsection 272(2)]. 
(b)  No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for motorists to proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public streets or private roads. 
(c)  Signs that revolve or are animated or that utilize movement or apparent movement to attract the attention of the public are prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, banners, streamers, animated display boards, pennants, and propellers are prohibited, but signs that only move occasionally because of wind are not prohibited if their movement is not a primary design feature of the sign, and is not intended to attract attention to the sign. The restrictions of this subsection shall not apply to signs specified in Subsection 272(4) or to signs indicating the time, date, or weather conditions. 
(d)  No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature or message it would tend to obstruct the view of or be confused with official traffic signs or other signs erected by governmental agencies. 
(e)  Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial supportive structure so that there is virtually no danger that either the sign or the supportive structure may be moved by the wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons or property. 
(f)  Canopy signs are permitted when suspended or attached to the underside of a canopy, provided such signs do not exceed six (6) square feet in area and shall be located at least eight (8) feet above the sidewalk. 
(g)  The sign area of a sign permanently painted, affixed, or placed in a building window which is visible from a street right-of-way shall be restricted to no more than forty (40) percent of the total window area. The sign area of such signs shall not be included in the total sign surface area established in accordance with the provisions of Section 276. 
(h)  Off-premises are not permitted except for those specifically exempt in accordance with Section 272. 
(i)  Any permitted sign in a business or industrial district where a property has frontage of two hundred (200) feet or more, may be or included thereof an electrically activated changeable sign not to exceed fifty (50) square feet in area, provided that the size of the sign may not exceed the area originally allotted. In addition, in shopping centers, up to two hundred (200) square feet of any allotted freestanding sign may be an electrically-activated changeable sign. 
(j)  Outdoor advertising signs shall not be located less than five hundred (500) feet from any other outdoor advertising sign on the same street side as measured along the street right-of-way line. An outdoor advertising sign on one (1) street side may not be located less than three hundred (300) feet from an outdoor advertising sign on the opposite side of the same street or from any other existing outdoor advertising sign. This minimum three hundred-foot provision applies to intersections and to parallel or curved streets located within three hundred (300) feet of an existing outdoor advertising sign. 
(Ord. No. 08-03a, § 1, 3-10-2008; Ord. No. 13-09, § 2, 12-9-2013) 
Section 284. - Nonconforming Signs. 
    Nonconforming signs are subject to the provisions of Article VIII of this ordinance, particularly Section 129. 
Section 285. - Shopping Center Signs. 
(a)  Shopping center developments, regardless of the zoning district in which located, shall conform to the sign regulations contained in this section. 
(b)  Wall signs for individual businesses in shopping center developments shall be calculated as provided in Subsection (c). The intent of these provisions is to allow each separate business establishment to have a reasonable means of identification. Because shopping centers include many individual businesses, the cumulative total wall sign area permitted by Subsection (c) may exceed the total sign area authorized in Section 276. 
(c)  One (1) wall sign per separate business establishment per street frontage is permitted. Allowable wall sign area is determined as follows: 
(1)  Establishments with a building frontage of one hundred (100) linear feet or less shall have no sign greater than fifty (50) square feet. 
(2)  Establishments with a building frontage of one hundred (100) linear feet or greater shall have a maximum wall sign area of zero and five tenths (0.5) square feet of sign area for each linear foot of building frontage or two hundred fifty (250) square feet of sign area, whichever is less. 
(d)  A freestanding sign located within a shopping center development shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 277(c) and Section 279. 
Section 286. - Sign Removal. 
    Any temporary sign erected in violation of the provisions of Section 273 may be removed immediately by the zoning officer. Any sign so removed shall be retained at a designated municipal facility until recovered by the sign owner following payment to the town of a five-dollar fee per sign. Any sign not recovered within ten (10) days will be destroyed. 
Section 287. - Discontinued Signs. 
    Upon the discontinuance of a business or occupancy of an establishment for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days, the zoning officer shall require the removal of the on-premises sign(s) advertising or identifying the establishment. The zoning officer shall give thirty (30) days' notice to the property owner to remove the sign(s). Failure to remove the sign(s) within the thirty-day period shall constitute a violation of this chapter [appendix] and shall be remedied in accordance with the provisions of Article VII. 
Section 288. - Projecting Signs. 
(a)  One (1) projecting sign per separate business establishment, not to exceed six (6) square feet in sign surface area, may be allowed in any nonresidential district. Projecting sign surface areas shall be included in the total sign surface area allowed in Section 276. 
(b)  A projecting sign may not project more than five (5) feet from the building wall. 
(c)  The bottom edge of a projecting sign must be located at least ten (10) feet above the sidewalk, except in cases in which such a sign is located underneath an awning or canopy, the bottom edge shall be at least eight (8) feet above the sidewalk. 
Section 289. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XVIII. - PARKING 

Section 290. - Definitions. 
    Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined below shall have the meaning indicated when used in this section. 
(1)  Circulation area. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area used for access to parking or loading areas or other facilities on the lot. Essentially, driveways and other maneuvering areas (other than parking aisles) comprise the circulation area. 
(2)  Driveway. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area that consists of a travel lane bounded on either side by an area that is not part of the vehicle accommodation area. 
(3)  Gross floor area. The total area of a building measured by taking the outside dimensions of the building at each floor level intended for occupancy or storage. 
(4)  Loading and unloading area. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area used to satisfy the requirements of Section 300. 
(5)  Vehicle accommodation area. That portion of a lot that is used by vehicles for access, circulation, parking and loading and unloading. It comprises the total of circulation areas, loading and unloading areas, and parking areas (spaces and aisles). 
(6)  Parking area aisles. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area consisting of lanes providing access to parking spaces. 
(7)  Parking space. A portion of the vehicle accommodation area set for the parking of one (1) vehicle. 
Section 291. - Number of Parking Spaces Required. 
(a)  All developments in all zoning districts other than the B-1 district shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question. 
(b)  The presumptions established by this article are that a development must comply with the parking standards set forth in Subsection (e) to satisfy the requirement stated in Subsection (a), and any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, the Table of Parking Requirements is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in Section 292. 
(c)  Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements (Subsection (e)), are indicated by a numerical reference keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses, Section 146. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one (1) parking space. 
(d)  The council recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements set forth in Subsection (e) cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide.

Section 292. - Flexibility in Administration Required. 
(a)  The council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Subsection 291(e) may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in Section 291, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Subsection 291(e) and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Subsection 291(a). 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Subsection 291(e) when it finds that: 
(1)  A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; 
(2)  A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade. 
(c)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in Subsection 291(e), it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation. 
(d)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by Subsection 291(e) for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XX. 
Section 293. - Parking Space Dimensions. 
(a)  Subject to Subsections (b) and (c), each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least nineteen (19) feet long and nine (9) feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section. 
(b)  In parking areas containing ten (10) or more parking spaces, up to twenty (20) percent of the parking spaces may contain a rectangular area of only eight (8) feet in width by sixteen (16) feet in length. If such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only. 
(c)  Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-two (22) feet by nine (9) feet. 
(d)  Parking spaces designated for use by a handicapped person shall have a minimum width of thirteen (13) feet and a minimum of nineteen (19) feet and shall be permanently and conspicuously marked for use by handicapped persons. The minimum number of parking spaces designed for use by a handicapped person shall be determined as follows: 
Total Parking Spaces 
Required by this 
Ordinance Required Handicapped- 
designated Spaces 1-50 1 space 51 + 1 handicapped-designated space per 50 total parking spaces required  
(Ord. No. 92-7, § 1, 6-8-92) 
Section 294. - Required Widths of Parking Area Aisles and Driveways. 
(a)  Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table, which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking. 
Parking Angle (feet) Aisle Width  0°       30°       45°       60°       90° One-way traffic 13       11       13       18       24 Two-way traffic 19       20       21       23       24  
(b)  Driveways shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width for one-way traffic and eighteen (18) feet in width for two-way traffic, except that ten-feet-wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when the driveway is not longer than fifty (50) feet; it provides access to not more than six (6) spaces; and sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public street. 
Section 295. - General Design Requirements. 
(a)  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one (1) or two (2) dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged. 
(b)  Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements. 
(c)  Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction. 
(d)  Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas. 
(e)  Driveway entrances and exits to parking areas shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of Section 213. 
(f)  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of Section 319. 
Section 296. - Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces. 
(a)  Vehicle accommodation areas are required to be graded and surfaced with asphalt or concrete. Vehicle accommodation areas paved with asphalt shall be constructed in the same manner as residential street surfaces (Appendix B, Section 1.12.8 through 1.12.11). If concrete is used as the paving material, vehicle accommodation areas shall be similarly constructed except that six (6) inches of concrete shall be used instead of two (2) inches of asphalt. The town engineer may allow other paving materials to be used so long as the equivalent level of stability is achieved. 
(b)  Parking spaces in areas paved with an impervious surface shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. 
(c)  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct. 
(d)  For uses such as churches, parks, playgrounds, ball fields, stadiums, fairgrounds, and other similar outdoor recreation uses that take place in an infrequent or limited manor; grass parking or other pervious parking surfaces will be allowed for no more than fifty (50) percent of the required vehicle spaces. Where provided, such alternative parking surfaces shall be maintained in a smooth, well-graded condition. If parking demand is such that the grass or lawn is caused to be damaged or destroyed to the extent that it ceases to grow, then paving of such an area in accordance with this section may be required. 
(Ord. No. 08-15, § 1, 12-8-08) 
Section 297. - Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces. 
(a)  One (1) parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one (1) use may not be credited to any other use. 
(b)  To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety (90) percent vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety (90) percent of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty (50) percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use of fifty (50) percent of the church lot's spaces on those other days. 
(c)  If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two (2) or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 298 are also applicable. 
Section 298. - Satellite Parking. 
(a)  If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter [appendix] cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as "satellite" parking spaces. 
(b)  All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located within four hundred (400) feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking, or within four hundred (400) feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance. Satellite parking spaces must be located in a zoning district which permits parking lots for the use intended. 
(c)  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces. 
Section 299. - Special Provisions For Lots With Existing Buildings. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter [appendix], whenever there exists a lot with one (1) or more structures on it constructed before September 9, 1974; and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot; and the parking requirements of Section 291 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 291 to the extent that parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located, and satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 298. However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available. 
Section 300. - Loading and Unloading Areas. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (e), whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner. 
(b)  The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question. The following table indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard. 
Gross Leasable Area 
of Building Number of spaces with minimum 
dimensions of 12 feet × 55 feet 
and overhead clearance 
of 14 feet from street grade   1,000- 19,999 1  20,000- 79,999 2  80,000-127,999 3 128,000-191,000 4 192,000-255,999 5 256,000-319,999 6 320,000-391,999 7  
Plus one (1) for each additional 72,000 square feet or fraction thereof. 
(c)  Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle. 
(d)  No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities. 
(e)  Whenever there exists a lot with one (1) or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this chapter [appendix], and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and the loading area requirements of this section cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for loading and unloading, then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent reasonably possible. 
Sections 301-303. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIX. - SCREENING AND TREES 
PART I. - SCREENING 

Section 304. - Council Findings Concerning the Need for Screening requirements. 
    The council finds that: 
(1)  Screening between two (2) lots lessens the transmission from one (1) lot to another of noise, dust, and glare. 
(2)  Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one (1) use from the visual assault of an adjacent use. 
(3)  Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening. 
(4)  The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare. 
Section 305. - General Screening Standard. 
    Every development shall provide and maintain sufficient screening so that: 
(1)  Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development; 
(2)  The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads. 
Section 306. - Compliance With Screening Standard. 
(a)  The table set forth in Section 308, in conjunction with the explanations in Section 307 concerning the types of screens, establishes screening requirements that, presumptively, satisfy the general standards established in Section 305. However, this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered in accordance with Section 309. 
(b)  The numerical designations contained in the Table of Screening Requirements (Section 308) are keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 146), and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in Section 307. This table indicates the type of screening that is presumptively required between two (2) uses. Where such screening is required, only one (1) of the two (2) adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening. The use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the "burdened" use in Section 308, and the other use is the "benefitted" use. 
(1)  To determine which of two (2) adjoining uses is required to install the screening, find the use classification number of one (1) of the adjoining uses in the burdened use column and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in the benefitted use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use. If the intersecting square contains a letter, then the use whose classification number is in the burdened column is responsible for installing that level of screening. If the intersecting square does not contain a letter, then begin the process again, starting this time in the burdened column with the other adjoining use. 
(2)  To merely determine the type of screening a proposed new development must install, begin under the "burdened" column with the use classification number of the proposed use and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the use classification number of each use that adjoins the property to be developed. For each intersecting square that contains a letter, the developer must install the level of screening indicated. 
(c)  If, when the analysis described in subdivision (b)(1) is performed, the burdened use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place, then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation, subject to all the provisions of Article VIII of this chapter [appendix]. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a two-family or multifamily development shall be required, at the time of construction, to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in Section 308, regardless of whether, in relation to such other uses, the two-family or multifamily development is the benefitted or burdened use. 
Section 307. - Descriptions of Screens. 
    The following three (3) basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the Table of Screening Requirements set forth in Section 308. 
(1)  Opaque screen, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six (6) feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spacial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in Appendix D. 
(2)  Semi-opaque screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three (3) feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in Appendix D. 
(3)  Broken screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in Appendix D.

Section 309. - Flexibility in Administration Required. 
(a)  The council recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements. Therefore, as provided in Section 306, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Section 308 and may require either more intensive or less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 305 without imposing unnecessary costs on the developer. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of Subsection (a), the permit-issuing authority may modify the presumptive requirements for: 
(1)  Commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business zoning districts; 
(2)  Commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the same zoning district; 
(3)  Uses located within planned residential developments (for screening requirements within planned residential developments, see Section 158). 
(c)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in Section 308, it shall enter on the face of the permit the screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 305 and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation. 
(d)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that a presumption established by Section 308 is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Screening Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XX. 
Section 310. - Combination Uses. 
(a)  In determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use and another use, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly, relying on the table set forth in Section 308 interpreted in the light of Section 309. 
(b)  When two (2) or more principal uses are combined to create a combination use, screening shall not be required between the component principal uses unless they are clearly separated physically, and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 305. 
Section 311. - Subdivisions. 
    When undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold, the subdivider shall not be required to install any screening. However, every attempt shall be made to retain existing vegetation. Screening shall be required, if at all, only when the lots are developed, and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the other requirements of Part I of this article. However, in residential districts, the subdivider shall provide a buffer strip at least twenty (20) feet in depth or width (in addition to the normal lot depth or width required) adjacent to all arterial and collector highways, all railroad rights-of-way, and industrial and commercial uses or zoning districts. This strip shall be a part of the platted lots, and shall have the following restrictions lettered on the face of the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures hereon is prohibited." 
Section 312. - Maintenance of Landscaping Materials. 
    The owner of the property upon which the landscaping materials required by this article have been installed shall be responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all such landscaping materials. Landscaped areas shall be kept in a proper, neat and orderly appearance and free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced by the property owner. Failure to maintain the required landscape materials shall constitute a zoning violation and shall be remedied in accordance with the provisions of Article VII. 
Section 313. - Width of Screened Areas and Vegetation Adjacent to Walls and Fences. 
    The width of screened areas required in this article will be dependent upon the method of screening used, but in no case shall the width be less than fifteen (15) feet. When walls or fences are used to meet screening requirements, vegetation shall, at a minimum, be planted on the benefitted side of the wall or fence sufficient to obstruct at least fifty (50) percent of the wall's or fence's surface. Exposed structural supports for the fence or wall shall be located on the burdened use side. 
PART II. - SHADING 

Section 314. - Council Findings and Declaration of Policy on Shade Trees. 
(a)  The council finds that: 
(1)  Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival; 
(2)  Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing, environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe; 
(3)  Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems; 
(4)  Trees have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers; 
(5)  Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control and flood control; 
(6)  Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land; and 
(7)  For the reasons indicated in Subsection (6), trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values. 
(b)  Based upon the findings set forth in Subsection (a), the council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working within the town's planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and, under the circumstances set forth in this article, to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments. 
Section 315. - Retention and Protection of Large Trees. 
(a)  Every development shall retain all existing trees twelve (12) inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would, in the opinion of the administrator, unreasonably burden the development. 
(b)  No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree twelve (12) inches in diameter or more, and no impervious surface (including, but not limited to, paving or buildings) may be located within the drip line of any tree twelve (12) inches in diameter (measured at a height of four and five tenths (4.5) feet above ground level) or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development. For purposes of this subsection, a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground. 
(c)  The retention or protection of trees twelve (12) inches in diameter or more as provided in Subsections (a) and (b) unreasonably burdens a development if, to accomplish such retention or protection, the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer. 
(d)  If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of Subsections (a) or (b), and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in Article XVIII cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces "lost" because of the provisions of Subsections (a) and (b), up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent of the required spaces. 
Sections 316, 317. - Reserved. 
Section 318. - Compliance with Landscaping and Screening Standards. 
    No building permit shall be issued until a landscaping plan delineating how the requirements of this article will be met has been submitted to and approved by the Town of Tarboro Development Review Committee, and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the landscaping is completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the administrator, unless a bond or other acceptable guarantee of improvements has been posted. 
PART III. - PARKING AND LOADING AREA LANDSCAPING 

Section 319. - Parking Area Landscaping. 
(a)  Every vehicle accommodation area containing ten (10) or more parking spaces shall be landscaped in accordance with the standards delineated in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  A minimum five-foot perpetually maintained natural or planted buffer yard must be provided to screen any vehicle accommodation area (where such area is not screened visually by an intervening building) from an adjoining street right-of-way or property line. The buffer yard shall contain at least one (1) tree for each sixty (60) linear feet of street frontage and each tree shall have a minimum caliper of one and five tenths (1.5) inches (measured six (6) inches above the ground) at the time of planting. Each tree shall be a species which can be expected to attain a minimum height of twenty (20) feet at maturity. The required buffer yard shall also contain evergreen shrubs, planted four (4) feet on center, which are eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches in height at the time of planting and are a species which can be expected to form a continuous landscape buffer at maturity. A combination of natural vegetation, fences, walls and berms may be utilized to achieve the screening requirements of this section. All trees and shrubs selected by the developer shall meet the standards set forth in Appendix D. Land uses required by Section 308 to provide a type A or B screen between adjoining uses or a street frontage are exempt from the requirements of this subsection. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees or shrubs or covered by a wall or other barrier shall be planted with grass, ground cover, or natural mulch of a minimum depth of three (3) inches. 
(c)  A minimum of five (5) percent of the interior of a vehicle accommodation area shall be devoted to landscaping. 
(d)  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking landscaping materials. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three (3) feet six (6) inches. 
Ord. No. 96-13, § 1, 7-8-96) 
PART IV. - SCREENING OF DUMPSTERS

(1)  Persons located within any dwelling unit on residential property other than that where the dumpster is located. 
(2)  Occupants, customers, or other invitees located within any building on nonresidential property other than that where the dumpster is located, unless such other property is used primarily for purposes permitted exclusively in an I zoning district. 
(3)  Persons travelling on any public street, sidewalk, or other public way. 
(b)  When dumpster screening is required under this section, such screening shall be constructed, installed, and located to prevent or remedy the conditions requiring the screening. 
PART V. - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL LANDSCAPED AREAS 

Section 319.02. - Irrigation. 
    A means of watering plant materials is recommended for all landscaped areas required in this article. 
Section 319.03. - Revegetation. 
    All areas cleared of existing vegetation shall be revegetated with grass and trees as soon as possible after being disturbed.

    Every attempt shall be made to preserve existing vegetation. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of all areas not devoted to buildings, streets, drives, parking, and loading areas shall be maintained in a natural state unless it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the permit-issuing authority, that revegetation would meet the intent of this article and would provide a vegetative pattern superior to the existing natural vegetation. 
Section 319.05. - Specificity of Plans. 
    All plans as required by this article shall be reviewed by the administrator and shall show the specific location of plant material to be planted and shall also show the specific location of plant material that will remain.

If the submission deadline date falls on a Saturday, the application must be received by the preceding Friday. If the submission deadline date falls on a Sunday, the application must be received by the following Monday. 
(c)  If a petition to rezone property is submitted under this section; and, following the first publication of the required advertisement for the public hearing on the proposed rezoning the petition is either withdrawn by the applicant or the council takes final action on the proposed amendment, then the town will not accept another petition seeking the rezoning of the same property for a period of one (1) year from the date the petition is withdrawn or the council takes final action on the proposed amendment. 
(Ord. No. 06-04, § 1, 5-8-06) 
Section 322. - Planning Board Consideration of Proposed Amendments. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a petition for an amendment, the administrator shall forward the request to the planning board for its consideration. 
(b)  The planning board shall endeavor to review the proposed amendment in such a timely fashion that any recommendations it may have can be presented to the council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. However, if the planning board is not prepared to make such recommendations, it may request the council to delay final action on the amendment until such time as the planning board can present its recommendations. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § 1, 2-8-10) 
Section 323. - Council Action on Amendments. 
(a)  If the planning board recommends the adoption of an amendment, the town council shall schedule a public hearing on the petition. 
(b)  If the planning board recommends against the adoption of an amendment, the petition shall be placed on the agenda of the town council for consideration. If the town council approves the recommendations of the planning board, the town council may summarily deny the petition and no public hearing need be held. If the town council rejects the recommendation of the planning board, a public hearing shall be scheduled. 
(c)  At the conclusion of a public hearing on the proposed amendment, the council may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure. 
(d)  The town council need not await the recommendations of the planning board before taking action on a proposed amendment nor is the council bound by any recommendations of the planning board that are before it at the time it takes action on a proposed amendment. 
(e)  The council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs. 
(f)  Voting on amendments to this ordinance shall proceed in the same manner as other ordinances, subject to Section 326. 
(Ord. No. 95-5, § 2, 3-6-95; Ord. No. 10-01, § 2, 2-8-10) 
Section 324. - Hearing Required; Notice. 
(a)  No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this chapter [appendix] may be adopted until a public hearing has been held on such ordinance. 
(b)  The town clerk shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any ordinance that amends the provisions of this chapter [appendix] once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall be published for the first time not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the hearing shall be. 
(c)  With respect to map amendments, the administrator shall mail written notice of the public hearing to the record owners for tax purposes of all properties whose zoning classification is changed by the proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties, any portion of which is within one hundred (100) feet of the property rezoned by the amendment. The notice required in this subsection shall not be required in the case of a comprehensive revision and readoption of the entire Tarboro Zoning Map unless the revision involves the rezoning of parcels of land to less intense uses or "down zoning", in which case notification to owners of those parcels shall also be made by first class mail. For purposes of this subsection, a comprehensive revision and readoption of the Tarboro Zoning Map does not require that each and every tract of land within the zoning jurisdiction experience a change in zoning classification as long as the rezoning represents comprehensive, jurisdiction-wide map revision and does not involve "down zoning". 
(d)  The planning staff shall also post notices of the public hearing in the vicinity of the property rezoned by the proposed amendment and take any other action deemed by the planning staff to be useful or appropriate to give notice of the public hearing on any proposed amendment. 
(e)  The notice required or authorized by this section (other than the posted notice required by subsection (d)) shall: 
(1)  State the date, time, and place of the public hearing; 
(2)  Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change; 
(3)  If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district classification, reasonably identify the property whose classification would be affected by the amendment; 
(4)  State that the full text of the amendment can be obtained from the town clerk; and 
(5)  State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be made following the public hearing. 
(6)  Summarize the protest petition provisions of Section 326 if the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district classification. 
(f)  The planning staff shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this section. However, it is the board's intention that the notice requirements set forth in this section that are not required by state law shall not be regarded as mandatory, and therefore a failure to comply with such requirements shall not render any amendment invalid. 
(g)  The person or persons mailing notices to adjoining property owners, as defined in G.S. Section 160A-384, shall certify to the town council that fact. 
(h)  Except for a town-initiated zoning map amendment, when an application is filed to request a zoning map amendment and that application is not made by the owner of the parcel of land to which the amendment would apply, the applicant shall certify to the town council that the owner of the parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing has received actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing. 
(i)  Actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing required under subsection 324(h) of this section shall be by any manner permitted under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j). If notice cannot with due diligence be achieved by personal delivery, registered or certified mail, or by a designated delivery service authorized pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2), notice may be given by publication consistent with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j1). This subsection applies only to an application to request a zoning map amendment where the application is not made by the owner of the parcel of land to which the amendment would apply. This subsection does not apply to a town-initiated zoning map amendment. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, §§ 2-6, 2-8-10) 
Section 325. - Ultimate Issue Before Council on Amendments. 
    In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this chapter [appendix], the central issue before the council is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the mayor and excluded. When considering proposed map amendments: 
(1)  Except for rezoning requests submitted in accordance with Section 327, the council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one (1) of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification. 
(2)  The council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large. 
Section 326. - Protests to Zoning District Changes. 
(a)  If a petition, opposing a change in the zoning classification of any property, is filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, then the proposed amendment may be adopted only by a favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the council membership. In accordance with G.S. Section 160A-385(a), provisions concerning protests shall not be applicable to any amendment which initially zones property added to the territorial coverage of the ordinance as a result of annexation or otherwise, or to an amendment to an adopted conditional use district if the amendment does not change the types of uses that are permitted within the district or increase the approved density for residential development, or increase the total approved size of nonresidential development, or reduce the size of any buffers or screening approved for the conditional use district. 
(b)  To trigger the three-fourths vote requirement, the petition must: 
(1)  Be signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more either of the lots included in a proposed change; or the lots within one hundred (100) feet of either side or the rear of the tract to be rezoned; or the lots directly opposite the tract to be rezoned and extending one hundred (100) feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots. 
(2)  Be in the form of a written petition actually bearing the signatures of the requisite number of property owners and stating that the signers do protest the proposed change or amendment. 
(3)  Be received by the town clerk in sufficient time to allow the town at least two (2) normal working days before the date established for a public hearing on the proposed amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition. 
(4)  Be on a form provided by the town clerk and contain all the information requested on this form. 
Section 327. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-01, § 1, adopted Jan. 14, 2013, repealed § 327, which pertained to conditional use district rezonings and derived from Ord. No. 04-06, § 1, 5-10-04. 
Section 328. - Vested Right. 
(a)  A vested right shall be established upon the approval or conditional approval of a site-specific development plan by the town council in accordance with the provisions outlined in this section. A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall, as a general rule, remain valid for two (2) years and shall attach to and run with the land. 
(b)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this subsection shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article. 
(1)  Landowner. Any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns, and personal representative of such owner. The landowner may allow a person holding a valid option to purchase to act as his agent or representative for purposes of submitting a proposed site-specific development plan. 
(2)  Property. All real property subject to the regulations and restrictions of this ordinance as well as the zoning district boundaries established by this ordinance and depicted on the official zoning map. 
(3)  Site-specific development plan. A plan which has been submitted to the Town of Tarboro by a landowner describing in detail the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. Such plan shall be in the form of a site plan required to obtain a conditional use permit and shall include the information required by Section 49 and Appendix A. All site specific-development plans shall be approved by the town council. 
(4)  Vested right. The right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site-specific development plan. 
(c)  A vested right shall be deemed established upon the effective date of approval by the town council of a site-specific development plan. Following the approval of a site-specific development plan, the administrator shall issue a vested right certificate to the landowner which indicates the duration of the vesting period, the conditions, if any, imposed on the approval of the site-specific development plan, and any other information determined by the zoning officer to be necessary to administer the vested right. 
(d)  A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property as delineated in the approved site-specific development plan. The town council may approve a site-specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may be determined necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Failure to comply with the approved terms and conditions shall result in a forfeiture of vested rights. 
(e)  Approval by the town council of a site-specific development plan shall follow the procedural requirements for the issuance of a conditional use permit as outlined in Articles IV and VI. Changes in or modifications to an approved site-specific development plan shall be made only with the concurrence of the town council in accordance with the provisions of Section 65. 
(f)  A vested right obtained under this section runs with the land and is valid for two (2) years from the effective date of approval by the town council of a site-specific development plan. A vested right shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved site-specific development plan unless expressly provided for by the town council. A vested right shall expire at the end of two (2) years if no building permit applications have been filed with the town to construct the use or uses proposed in the approved site-specific development plan. If building permits are issued, the provisions of G.S. Section 160A-418 and G.S. Section 160A-422 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the lack of progress during the two-year vesting period. 
(g)  A vested right, once established or provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by the town which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the approved site-specific development plan, except: 
(1)  With the written consent of the affected landowner; 
(2)  Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or manmade hazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site-specific development plan; 
(3)  To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the town, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action; 
(4)  Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the town of the site-specific development plan; or 
(5)  Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific development plan, in which case the town may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing. 
(h)  The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. 
(i)  Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the establishment of a vested right shall not preclude, change, or impair the authority of the town to enforce provisions of this ordinance governing nonconforming situations or uses. 
(j)  A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such vested rights. 
(k)  The town shall not require a landowner to waive his vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. 
Appendix A 
Information Required With Applications 
A-1. - In General. 
(a)  As provided in Section 49, it is presumed that all of the information listed in this appendix must be submitted with an application for a zoning, sign, special use, or conditional use permit to enable the permit-issuing authority to determine whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all the requirements of this chapter [appendix]. As set forth in Section 92, applications for variances are subject to the same provisions. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more information or accept as sufficient less information according to the circumstances of the particular case. A developer who believes information presumptively required by this appendix is unnecessary shall contact the planning staff for an interpretation. 
(b)  As also provided in Section 49, the administrator shall develop application processes, including standard forms, to simplify and expedite applications for simple developments that do not require the full range of information called for in this appendix. In particular, developers seeking only permission to construct single-family or two-family residences or to construct new or modify existing signs should contact the administrator for standard forms. 
A-2. - Written Application. 
    Every applicant for a variance or a zoning, sign, special use or conditional use permit shall complete a written application containing at least the following information: 
(1)  The name, address, and phone number of the applicant. 
(2)  If the applicant is not the owner of the property in question, the name, address, and phone number of the owner, and the legal relationship of the applicant to the owner that entitles the applicant to make application. 
(3)  The date of the application. 
(4)  Identification of the particular permit sought. 
(5)  A succinct statement of the nature of the development proposed under the permit or the nature of the variance. 
(6)  Identification of the property in question by street address and tax map reference. 
(7)  The zoning district within which the property lies. 
(8)  A boundary survey showing the dimensions and the number of square feet in the lot where the development is to take place. 
(9)  The gross floor area of all existing or proposed buildings located on the lot where the development is to take place. 
(10)  If the proposed development is a two-family or multifamily residential development or an architecturally integrated subdivision, the number of one-, two-, three-, or four-bedroom dwelling units proposed for construction. 
A-3. - Development Site Plans. 
    Subject to section A-1 of this appendix, every application for a variance or a zoning, sign, special use or conditional use permit shall contain plans that locate the development site and graphically demonstrate existing and proposed natural, manmade, and legal features on and near the site in question, all in conformity with sections A-4 through A-6 of this appendix.

(b)  Development site plans shall be drawn to scale, using such a scale that all features required to be shown on the plans are readily discernible. Very large developments may require that plans show the development in sections to accomplish this objective without resorting to plans that are so large as to be cumbersome, or the objective may be accomplished by using different plans or plans drawn to different scales to illustrate different features. In all cases, the permit-issuing authority shall make the final determination whether the plans submitted are drawn to the appropriate scale, but the applicant for a conditional or special use permit relies in the first instance on the recommendations of the planning staff. 
(c)  Development site plans should show on the first page the following information: 
(1)  Name of applicant. 
(2)  Name of development (if any). 
(3)  North arrow.

Appendix D 
Screening and Trees 
D-1. - Guide for Protecting Existing Trees. 
    Section 315 provides for the retention and protection of large trees when land is developed. In order to better ensure the survival of existing trees, the developer shall heed the following guidelines: 
(a)  Protect trees with fencing and armoring during the entire construction period. The fences should enclose an area extending from the center of the tree to the dripline. 
(b)  Do not excavate beneath the crown of the tree. 
(c)  Do not compact the soil around existing trees with any equipment. Do not pile direct or store material or park equipment beneath the crown of the tree. 
(d)  Keep fires or other sources of extreme heat well clear of existing trees. 
(e)  Repair damaged roots and branches immediately. Exposed roots should be covered with topsoil. Injured trees must be thoroughly watered during the ensuing growing year. 
(f)  No paving or other impermeable ground cover should be placed within the dripline of large trees (twelve (12) inches or greater in diameter) or within two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the distance from the trunk to the dripline of any other size tree to be retained. 
D-2. - Standards for Parking Lot Trees. 
    Trees planted in compliance with the requirements of Section 319 should have most or all of the following qualities. The trees recommended in section D-10 represent the best combinations of these characteristics. 
(a)  Hardiness: 
(1)  Resistance to extreme temperatures. 
(2)  Drought resistance. 
(3)  Resistance to storm damage. 
(4)  Resistance to air pollution. 
(5)  Ability to survive physical damage from human activity. 
(b)  Life cycle: 
(1)  Moderate to rapid rate of growth. 
(2)  Long life. 
(c)  Foliage and branching: 
(1)  Tendency to branch high above the ground. 
(2)  Wide spreading habit. 
(3)  Relatively dense foliage for maximum shading. 
(d)  Maintenance: 
(1)  Resistance to pests. 
(2)  Resistance to plant diseases. 
(3)  Little or no pruning requirements. 
(4)  No significant litter problems.

D-5. - Guide for Planting and Maintaining Trees. 
    The trees recommended in section D-10 have minimal maintenance requirements. However, all trees must receive a certain degree of care, especially during and immediately after planting. In order to protect an investment in new trees, the developer and his or her agents should follow these guidelines when planting: 
(a)  Plant trees with a minimum caliper of two (2) inches measured six (6) inches above the ground and a root ball no smaller than two (2) feet in diameter and sixteen (16) inches in depth. 
(b)  The best times for planting are early spring and early fall. Trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration. 
(c)  Plant all trees at least three-and-a-half (31/2) feet from the end of head-in parking spaces in order to prevent damage from car overhangs. 
(d)  Dig the tree pit at least two (2) feet wider than the root ball and at least six (6) inches deeper than the ball's vertical dimension. 
(e)  Especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil, the bottom of the pit should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel. 
(f)  After the pit is dug, observe subsurface drainage conditions. Where poor drainage exists, the tree pit should be dug at least an additional twelve (12) inches wider and the soil amended to allow roots to grow properly. 
(g)  Backfill should include a proper mix of soil and fertilizer. All roots must be completely covered. Backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots. 
(h)  Immediately after it is planted, the tree should be supported with stakes and straps to firmly hold it in place as its root system begins to develop. Remove stakes and ties after one (1) year. 
(i)  Spread at least three (3) inches of mulch over the entire excavation in order to retain moisture and keep down weeds. An additional three-inch saucer of mulch should be provided to form a basin around the trunk of the tree. This saucer helps catch and retain moisture. 
(j)  Conscientious post-planting care, especially watering, pruning and fertilizing, is a must for street and parking lot trees. Prune off broken or damaged branches.

D-9. - Guide for Planting Shrubs. 
    Shrubs planted for screening purposes should be given a proper culture and sufficient room in which to grown. Shrubs should, at a minimum, be in three gallon containers and a minimum of thirty (30) inches in height. They should be planted no more than eighteen (18) inches apart in a diamond or staggered pattern. Many of the guidelines for tree planting listed in section D-5 also apply to shrubs. However, because specific requirements vary considerably between shrub trees, this appendix does not attempt to generalize the needs of all shrubs. For detailed planting information or individual species, refer to: Landscape Plants of the Southeast by R. Gordon Halfacre and Anne R. Shawcroft, 5th Edition. 
D-10. - Lists of Recommended Trees and Shrubs. 
    The following lists indicate plantings which will meet the screening and shading requirements of Article XIX of the Land Development Ordinance. The lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for screening and shading purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four (4) principal criteria: general suitability for the coastal plain section of North Carolina, ease of maintenance, tolerance of city conditions, and availability from area nurseries. When selecting new plantings for a particular site, a developer should first consider the types of plants which are thriving on or near that site. Accordingly, native North Carolina species should often be favored. However, if an introduced species has proven highly effective for screening or shading in the Tarboro area, it too may be a proper selection.

D-11. - Small Trees for Partial Screening. 
    The following trees are recommended for use in all types of screens. Though smaller than the trees listed in planting lists D-12 and D-13, each of these trees will reach a height of at least twenty (20) feet. 
River Birch (Betula nigra). Height: 20-40 feet; Spread: 8-16 feet. 
The River Birch is a native tree which usually grows along stream banks. In landscape design, it is adaptable to either high or low locations, but still requires a lot of moisture. This tree has an interesting, papery bark and a graceful branching habit. It has no special pest or maintenance problems. 
American Hornbeam (Carpinus carolinia). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread: 15-20 feet. 
This native tree has a natural yet refined appearance. It is slow growing, but at maturity it serves as an excellent small shade tree. Its fluted, "muscular" trunk is an interesting feature. In the wild, the American Hornbeam is common in moist rich soil, yet, when used in landscape design, it is soil tolerant and does not require an unusual amount of water. It has no pests and no special maintenance problems. 
Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread: 12-25 feet. 
This native tree is covered by beautiful pink flowers in the Spring and develops a dense round crown when allowed to grow in direct sunlight. The Redbud has some pests, and its fruit pods may present a litter problem, but it recommends itself for being drought resistant and tolerant of polluted city air. 
Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida). Height: 15-30 feet; Spread: 15-20 feet. 
The Dogwood is a native woodland tree which is very popular for landscape planting. It is considered to be a fairly hardy tree, but, when planted in direct sun, it must be frequently watered. A healthy dogwood will develop attractive horizontal branches and a bushy crown. Dogwoods look best when planted in groups or when used as an accent in borders. These trees should be guarded against borers and other pests. 
Russian Olive (Elaegnus augustifolia). Height: 15-20 feet; Spread: 20-30 feet. 
The Russian Olive can withstand severe exposure and will grow in almost any soil. Its toughness and wide spreading habit make it an exceptional screening plant. The foliage is an attractive silver-gray color and its flowers, though inconspicuous, are very fragrant. The Russian Olive is especially notable for its rapid growth. It has no pest problems but it may require periodic trimming of dead twigs. 
Mountain Silverbell (Halesia monticola). Height: 20-40 feet; Spread: 20 feet. 
Silverbells are attractive multi-stem trees which are native to the southeastern United States. They are excellent plants for a natural effect and are best placed where their small flowers and pods will be closely observed. Compared to other trees on this list, its crown is more open and irregular. The Mountain Silverbell has no pests, no maintenance problems, and no special soil requirements. 
American Holly (Ilex opaca). Height: 15-30 feet; Spread: 10-20 feet. 
This familiar native tree possesses a pyramidal evergreen crown with abundant red berries in the winter. It grows best in full sun and prefers moist yet well-drained soils. If the lower limbs are allowed to grow naturally, they will branch to the ground. Hollies should be protected from high winds. The American Holly is a relatively slow grower. 
Crape Myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica). Height: 15-25 feet; Spread: 15-20 feet. 
This popular flowering tree is decorative and interesting in all seasons. However, it should not be expected to stand alone as a screen. It is most effective against an evergreen background. It grows best in direct sun and may develop mildew problems when planted in shade. Crape Myrtle may be pruned to a desired shape, but when left on its own it will form a densely branching crown. 
Sourwood (Oxyndrum arboreum). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread: 10-15 feet. 
Sourwoods are handsome native trees which are most effective in landscape design when planted in groups. They are easy to transplant and as each tree matures it assumes a slender form with upright branches. Sourwood prefers relatively dry acid soils. Its only special maintenance problems may be infestations of webworms. 
Carolina Cherry-Laurel (Prunus caroliniana). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread: 15-20 feet. 
This tree is prized for its dense evergreen foliage. It may be trimmed as a hedge, but also serves as an excellent screen in its natural form. The Cherry-Laurel grows rapidly and has no pests. However, it may not be as cold hardy as other trees on this list. 
Gallery Pear (Pyrus calleryana). Height: 20-40 feet; Spread: 20-30 feet. 
The Callery Pear has recently gained popularity as a city street tree because it is impervious to air pollution. Furthermore, it will grow in relatively infertile soils. It is a beautiful, upright tree which grows rapidly and is long lived. However, it may be subject to an assortment of pests and diseases. The "Bradford" variety is not recommended, due to its poor branching structure resulting in a short life. 
Foster Holly (Ilex attenuata). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread 7-10 feet. 
A very popular hybrid holly. This selection tolerates city conditions and has very few pest and disease problems. In the fall and winter, it produces profuse clusters of red berries. 
Nellie R. Stevens Holly (Ilex "Nellie R. Stevens") Height: 15-25 feet; Spread 10-15 feet. 
A dark glossy leaved holly which is vigorous and drought resistant. This small tree has no special needs, but may be infested with scale. It is a heavy producer of red berry-like fruit in the fall and winter. 
Devilwood (Osmanthus americanus). Height: 15-20 feet; Spread 10-15 feet. 
Devilwood is an interesting low maintenance tree for urban areas. It is easily transplanted and may be grown as a single or multi-trunk plant. Although it has no significant pest problems, it does require a high amount of moisture. 
D-12. - Large Trees for Evergreen Screening. 
    The following trees are ideal for screening large scale areas such as shopping centers and industrial sites. They are also effective in combination with other, smaller screening plants. All three (3) are moderate to fast growers. They are not considered to be shade trees. 
Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara). Height: 40-150 feet; Spread: 30 plus feet. 
The Deodar Cedar is a useful attractive evergreen. It should be allowed plenty of room in order to assume its beautiful natural form. Its pendulous branches should be allowed to touch the ground. It prefers relatively dry soils, grows rapidly, and is easy to maintain. "True Cedars" such as the Deodar are not native to North America, but they have become quite popular in the South as a landscape tree. 
Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Height: 40-60 feet; Spread: 25 plus feet. 
Magnolias are striking trees which serve well as screens when their branches are allowed to grow to the ground. Generally, this tree does well in city conditions, but it should be planted in quite rich acidic soils and it requires a lot of moisture. Furthermore, Magnolias require ample space for growth. If planted in full sunlight, they will grow rapidly. Because it drops large waxy leaves, seed pods, and flowers, the Magnolias may present a litter problem. 
Canadian Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Height: 30-70 feet; Spread: 20 plus feet. 
It may be sheared or pruned to any shape, but when it grows naturally, its graceful branches form an excellent high screen. The Hemlock prefers cooler, partially shaded locations and does best in highly fertile soils. It grows quite rapidly. Carolina hemlocks are not widely available and are not as reliable to withstand heat as the Canadian Hemlock. 
Leyland Cypress (Cupressocyparis leylandii). Height: 60-70 feet; Spread: 12-17 feet. 
Leyland Cypress is rapid-growing and forms an excellent screen. Although it looks best unpruned, it is very tolerant of pruning. This plant contrasts well with broadleaf evergreens. 
White Pine (Pinus strobus). Height: 80-100 feet; Spread 30-40 feet. 
White Pine makes a good screen until lower branches fall off. It is easy to transplant in small or large sizes. 
D-13. - Large Trees for Shading. 
    The following trees may be used for screening, but they are recommended especially for shading streets and parking lots. Unless otherwise noted, they will grow rapidly. Each species will attain a mature spread of a least thirty (30) feet. 
Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum). Height: 50-75 feet; Spread: 30-40 feet. 
The Sugar Maple provides a very dense form which has outstanding fall coloring. It grows best in association with other trees and in a clean atmosphere. Young trees are susceptible to sun scald if not properly protected. Pest problems with the Sugar Maple include anthracnose, leaf spot, leaf blister, and scales. This tree requires good drainage and a soil with medium to high fertility. The Sugar Maple has a slow growth rate. 
Red Maple (Acer rubrum). Height: 40-50 feet; Spread: 25 plus feet. 
This tree is an example of a maple which is not recommended where there will be high concentrations of air pollution. However, with its excellent shading characteristics and beautiful colors, it should not be ignored. This tree grows rapidly, but, unlike the Norway Maple, it does not become brittle with age. The Red Maple is a native tree which is usually found in moist, even swampy areas, but it adapts well to a variety of situations. Although subject to Maple insects and diseases, it is usually a long lived tree. Cultivars of this species should be used. 
Ginkgo or Maidenhair Tree (Ginkgo biloba). Height: 40-80 feet; Spread: 30 plus feet. 
The Ginkgo is a tree which is recommended for several outstanding reasons. It is one of the oldest surviving species of trees. It is adaptable to any soil, climate, or degree of exposure to the sun. It does quite well in the city. It has no pests, no diseases, and no pruning requirements. In sum, it is a tree of exceptional vitality. The North Carolina Department of Forest Resources call the Ginkgo, "probably the best all around street tree." Two (2) reservations are worth stating, however. First, only male trees should be planted because female Ginkgos bear a messy, malodorous fruit. Second, the Ginkgo is a slow grower. When young, it has a rather gangly appearance. It takes twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) years to assume its mature, symmetrically spreading form. 
Honeylocust (Gleditisia triacanthos). Height: 50-75 feet; Spread: 25 plus feet. 
Its open, spreading form and feathery leaves may give the Honeylocust a frail appearance, but it is in fact a quite sturdy tree, notable for its resistance to city conditions. Grass and shrubs thrive beneath a Honeylocust because it casts a light shade. This tree is especially useful for its ability to be transplanted at a relatively advanced age. Accordingly, it may be used for immediate effect in a landscape design. The Honeylocust has its own pests and diseases, but it is fairly hardy. Thornless and fruitless varieties such as "Moraine" are strongly recommended. 
Sweet Gum (Liquidamber styraciflua). Height: 60-100 feet; Spread: 50 plus feet. 
The Sweet Gum is a native bottomland tree which adapts to a variety of soils. Its dense foliage and balanced form make it an excellent shade tree for large open areas. The Sweet Gum needs sun and plenty of room to achieve maximum size and beauty. In the fall, its leaves turn a brilliant wine and gold color. Other than cleanup of its prickly seed balls, the Sweet Gum poses no special maintenance problems. Seedless varieties are available. 
London Plane-Tree (Platanus acerifolia). Height: 70-100 feet; Spread: 30 plus feet. 
The London Plane-Tree is excellent for streets and parking lots for a variety of reasons. It puts out its branches high enough above the ground so as not to obstruct traffic. Its broadly spreading crown makes is especially useful along wide streets. The London Plane is one of the world's hardiest trees in polluted air. Although it needs plenty of sun and moisture, it is undemanding about soil. Finally, it is very long lived. The London Plane-Tree is a hybrid of the Sycamore, and like the Sycamore, it may suffer from certain diseases. However, it is more resistant. Cultivars are available. 
Eastern Red Oak (Quercus rubra). Height: 50-70 feet; Spread: 40 plus feet. 
This tree grows faster than any other oak, two (2) feet or more per year. It is prized as a tree because its high branching habit gives it an ideal shape. The Red Oak grows in almost any average soil and presents no special maintenance problems. 
Willow Oak (Quercus phellos). Height: 60-80 feet; Spread: 30 plus feet. 
This is another rapidly growing oak. It has proven to be quite successful as a street and parking lot tree. Its slender leaves give it a finer texture than that of other oaks, but it still casts excellent shade. The Willow Oak is native to bottomland soils, and, thus, it needs plenty of moisture. It often spreads majestically as it matures so it should be given ample room to grow. No significant pests or diseases afflict the Willow Oak. 
Scarlet Oak (Quercus coccinea). Height: 60-80 feet; Spread: 40 plus feet. 
This is a third oak which grows rapidly and is easy to maintain. The Scarlet Oak is more difficult to transplant than the red or the willow, but it may be a worthwhile selection for its excellent foliage. 
Laurel Oak (Quercus laurifolia). Height: 40-60 feet; Spread: 30 plus feet. 
The Laurel Oak grows more slowly than the other oaks listed above, but it has the advantage of being nearly evergreen in piedmont sections of North Carolina. It has proven to be a good street tree and does quite well under city conditions. It presents no special maintenance problems. 
Littleleaf Linden (Tilia cordata). Height: 30-50 feet; Spread: 25 plus feet. 
Lindens are notable for their exceptional symmetry and their ability to grow in poor soils. The Littleleaf Linden requires plenty of moisture, but it has proven to be useful for city planting and is especially recommended as a street tree. With its many thick branches and abundant foliage, the Linden provides very dense shade. It should be sprayed for aphids in order to prevent sticky droppings from the leaves. Best suited for parks. 
Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum). Height: 50-100 feet; Spread 20-30 feet. 
Bald Cypress is often used as a specimen for poorly drained sites, but also grows well in average soil. It is a slow growing tree and has no special pruning or disease problems. This tree is very exotic in appearance. 
Japanese Zelkova (Zelkova serrata). Height: 50-60 feet; Spread 40-50 feet. 
This tree is very similar in appearance to the American Elm, but is apparently resistant to Dutch Elm disease. It is an excellent shade tree with very few pest problems. 
D-14. - Small Shrubs for Evergreen Screening. 
    The following shrubs are recommended for informal (unclipped) hedges or screens. Each species grows to a height of less than six (6) feet; therefore, these shrubs are appropriate for semi-opaque screens (Type B). 
Glossy Abelia (Abelia grandflora). Height: 4-6 feet; Spread: 3-5 feet. 
Abelia is quite common in local nurseries and tends to be less expensive than other shrubs on this list. It bears pale pink flowers throughout the summer. Although it has proven quite popular for informal hedges, it has several drawbacks. Abelia should be pruned and thinned to maintain its best form. It may drop its leaves due to low temperatures, lack of pruning, or starvation. 
Warty Barberry (Barberis verruculosa). Height: 3-4 feet; Spread: 3-4 feet. 
Barberrys as a group have proven to be excellent as hedge plants. With their dense, spiny limbs, they are effective barriers in public places. The Warty Barberry is a shrub with a neat, compact habit. It is soil tolerant and has no special maintenance requirements. It grows slowly, but it will reach a height of three (3) to (4) feet within five (5) years. 
Wintergreen Barberry (Berberis julianae). Height: 4-6 feet; Spread: 2-5 feet. 
This is another Barberry which forms an impenetrable thorny hedge. In fact, it grows even more densely than the Warty Barberry. It is pest resistant and is very hardy. No pruning is required. Because it is fairly slow growing, it will take eight (8) to ten (10) years to reach a height of five (5) to six (6) feet. 
Dwarf Horned Holly (Ilex cornuta `rotunda'). Height: 3 feet; Spread: 3-4 feet. 
This shrub is an excellent selection for a low hedge. It is soil tolerant and requires no pruning or other special care once established. With its spiny leaves, this plant appears to be and is, in fact, rugged. Like all hollies, it grows best in full sun, but unlike others of its species, it produces bright red berries without both sexes being present. 
Littleleaf Japanese Holly (Ilex crenata `microphylla'). Height: 4-6 feet; Spread: 5-7 feet. 
This holly is a good substitute for the more finicky and often more expensive boxwood. It withstands pruning, but is quite attractive in its natural form. Although considered to be slow growing, it will form a stiff six-foot tall hedge within ten (10) years. The Littleleaf Japanese Holly grows will in both sun and shade and does well in city conditions. 
Convexa Japanese Holly (Ilex crenata `convexa'). Height: 4-6 inches; Spread: 3-5 feet. 
The Convexa Japanese Holly is another good boxwood substitute. This shrub is considered to be one of the most attractive, hardy and serviceable hollies for landscape use. It is attractive in either a clipped or unclipped form. It grows faster than the Littleleaf Japanese Holly. 
India Hawthorn (Raphiolepis indica). Height: 3-4 feet; Spread: 4-5 feet. 
With its spreading, irregular branching, the India Hawthorn makes an excellent informal hedge. It is tolerant of a variety of soils and is fairly drought resistant. However, it is not as cold tolerant and pest resistant as other shrubs on this list. 
Azaleas and Rhododendrons (Rhododendron species). Height: 3 plus feet; Spread: 3 plus feet. 
Many varieties of azaleas and rhododendrons are dense and evergreen and are, therefore, good screening material. The universal popularity of this large shrub family belies the fact that its members must not be planted indiscriminately. As a group, Rhododendron species prefer cool, moist, well drained, acidic soil which has a fairly high organic content. They do best in shade or partial shade particularly when they are planted in extremely hot or windy locations. Planting in full sun is not recommended. In spite of these requirements, once established in good soil with the correct culture and water, both rhododendrons and azaleas tend to take care of themselves. Some relatively hardy and vigorous species are: Kurume Azaleas (R. obtusum), Snow Azaleas (R. mucronatum), Indian Azaleas (R. indicum), and the native Carolina Rhododendron (R. carolinianum). 
Dwarf Burford Holly (Ilex cornuta `Burfordii Nana'). Height: 4-6 feet; Spread: 4-6 feet.

Guidelines for the Preparation of a Traffic Impact Assessment 
F-1. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 03-09, § 4, adopted March 10, 2003 repealed § F-1. Formerly, such section pertained to thresholds for Requiring a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) and derived from Ord. No. 00-09, § 8, 5-8-00. 
F-2. - General Requirements for a Standard TIA. 
(a)  A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is to be prepared and sealed by an engineer registered in North Carolina and specializing in traffic or transportation, with experience in preparing TIA's. 
(b)  A standard TIA includes the following elements: 
(1)  Abstract or summary. Summarize description of proposed development, location, traffic generation, existing and future conditions (level-of-service), and recommended improvements. Should not exceed two (2) pages, preferably one (1) page. 
(2)  Description of development. Describe acreage included in development, existing and proposed land use, existing and proposed zoning, proposed density (number of housing units, square feet of development, etc.). 
(3)  Study area. Generally one-quarter (1/4) mile to one-half (1/2) mile from each proposed site access along roads accessed by the site. This area may in a few cases be greater if the site is on a road with no intersection within that distance. 
(4)  Site location. Include location map showing site in relation to major streets and at least one (1) mile radius from site. 
(5)  Traffic generation. Indicate number of trips generated by site daily, AM peak hour, PM peak hour. Indicate internal or pass-by traffic generation if appropriate. For rezoning may indicate traffic generation under existing zoning as well as proposed zoning. Indicate source of trip generation rate, land use code, and units used to derive generation. 
(6)  Trip distribution. Indicate percentage distribution of trips by direction within study area and methods used to obtain. 
(7)  Access location(s). Location of planned streets or driveways and access to existing streets. Indicate other streets or driveways within study area, including those across the street. Indicate coordination with NCDOT where appropriate. 
(8)  Existing road and traffic conditions. Street laneage and classification, traffic control devices, existing daily traffic volumes within study area. Show traffic volumes and level of service of signalized intersections and proposed site access points within study area during AM and PM peak hour (PM only for retail). Include work sheets or computer printouts showing counted traffic volumes and level of service. Illustrate in figure(s) showing peak hour volumes, lanes, level-of-service. For unsignalized intersections, show level-of-service for individual movements. Discuss transit service if applicable. Discuss accident history, if appropriate. 
(9)  Planned improvements. Discuss and describe any planned road improvements in the study area or which could affect future traffic. Note whether project is shown on thoroughfare plan, collector street plan, or NCDOT Transportation Improvements Program (TIP). 
(10)  Future conditions. Same as for existing-conditions, plus site traffic assigned to driveways or access points, for conditions with full buildout of project, at buildout year. Include growth in background traffic due to other approved developments or to general growth in area. May show more than one (1) phase, if project is to be phased. Discuss any conflicts with other driveways or streets, queuing problems, potential safety problems. 
(11)  Pedestrian facilities. Indicate location of existing and proposed sidewalks and crosswalks, internal pedestrian paths. 
(12)  Recommended improvements. Indicate improvements required for access points and signalized intersections within study area to operate at acceptable level of service (D or better). These may include site access, internal site circulation, signalization, signal modification (retiming, additional phases), land modifications or additions, or street widening. A signal warning warrant study is not required but may be included as supporting documentation where a traffic signal is requested. Note: Showing recommended improvement does not necessarily indicate responsibility for improvement. Report may indicate which improvements are due to development and which are due to existing problems or other growth in traffic, any may suggest responsibility of developer or of other parties for improvements. Proposed improvements should be shown schematically on figure. 
(Ord. No. 00-09, § 8, 5-8-00) 
F-3. - General Requirements for and [an] Enhanced TIA. 
(a)  An enhanced TIA includes all of the elements of a standard TIA plus the following: 
(1)  Study area. Generally from one (1) to three (3) miles from each proposed site access along roads accessed by the site. The extent of the study area should be discussed with Town staff prior to initiating the TIA. 
(2)  Internal circulation. Review internal circulation patterns and note recommended changes. 
(3)  Trip distribution. Use of a computer model for distribution may be desirable for major projects. 
(4)  Future conditions. Projects in this category, other than perhaps shopping centers, are likely to be phased. Desirable to show conditions at end of planning period (generally twenty (20) years or horizon used for thoroughfare plan). 
(5)  Recommended improvements For major projects, these may involve changes to the thoroughfare plan or collector street plan. The project may include the construction of portions of thoroughfare within or adjacent to the site.
