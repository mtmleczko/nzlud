ARTICLE XIII ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS
SEC. 13.01  ACTION OF COUNCIL.

indebtedness to be evidenced by the issuance of bonds or notes, or for the

manner hereinafter provided.  All other action may be taken by resolution.
SEC. 13.02  INTRODUCTION OF ORDINANCES.
   Each proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing by a member of
Council in a form prepared by the Solicitor and shall contain a descriptive
title and opening clause reading "Be it ordained by the Council of the Village

length the action proposed to be taken.  Each ordinance, except an
appropriation ordinance, shall contain one subject, which shall be clearly set
forth in the title.
SEC. 13.03  ADOPTION OF STANDARD CODES BY REFERENCE.
   Council may, by reference to the date and source, and without reproducing it
at length in the ordinance, adopt model or standard codes prepared and
published by public or private agencies on such matters as fire prevention,
building construction, electrical wiring, plumbing, heating, ventilating, air
conditioning, and other similar matters.  However, if Council desires to
modify, add to, or eliminate from any such code and section or part thereof,
such addition, modification, or omission shall be clearly stated in the
ordinance, together with a cross reference to its location in the code.  In all
cases in which such a code shall be adopted by reference, publication by the

least one copy of each such code shall be kept in the office of the Manager for
examination by interested persons during regular office hours.  In the enacting

   No ordinance or resolution shall be passed without the concurrence of the
majority of all members elected or appointed to Council.  Before passage, every
ordinance shall be fully and distinctly read on two separate days at an
official meeting of Council, unless an emergency is declared as hereinafter
provided, or unless by vote of two-thirds of all the members of Council a
reading thereof in full on two different days is dispensed with, in which cases
such ordinance shall be read in full one time at an official meeting and may be
passed on the day of such reading.  For its second reading, an ordinance may be
read by title only upon the vote of majority of the members of Council,
provided there has been no change in the text of the ordinance between the
first and second readings. Resolutions may be acted upon immediately after a
single reading.
   Council may, in its discretion, determine that ordinances or resolutions be
presented in written form and copies filed with each Council member, the Clerk
of Council and also posted in the official posting places, six days prior to
the Council meeting when the matter is to be considered.  If said ordinance or
resolution is so presented then Council may, by vote of a majority of its
members, suspend the rules of Council and authorize the ordinance or resolution
to be read by title only without a reading in full.
   Every vote upon every ordinance or upon other matters as to which any member
shall so demand, shall be taken upon a roll call and entered upon the journal. 
Council may, by ordinance, adopt rules not inconsistent with this Charter for
governing its own proceedings, and for all other matters pertaining to the
exercise of its powers in the performance of its duties.  Passage of every
ordinance and every resolution shall be certified by the signatures of the
Mayor, or Vice Mayor, and the Clerk of Council.  The Clerk of Council shall
record all ordinances and resolutions, in full, in separate ordinance and
resolution volumes, which shall be a public record available for examination,
upon request, in the Clerk of Council office by interested persons during
regular office hours.

additional evidence.

the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and such
additional evidence as the Court has admitted, that the decision is supported
by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the
law. In the absence of such a finding, it may reverse, vacate or modify the
decision, or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative and
substantial evidence, and is in accordance with the law. All parties shall pay
its own costs, including attorney fees, associated with the appeal.

constitutionality, construction or interpretation of the city's Charter,
ordinances, and rules of Council, and in such appeal the Court may also review
and determine the correctness of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas,
whether the decision of Council is supported by reliable, probative and
substantial evidence in the record.

§ 34.03  HEALTH, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE.
   It is the intention of City Council to provide health insurance and term
insurance for all regular and full-time employees and health insurance for
regular long-term part-time employees as follows:
   (A)   The city may enter into contractual agreements for the purpose of
providing health insurance for all regular and full-time employees, and pay a
negotiated portion of the premiums for both the employee and family coverage. 
The city may also offer regular long-term part-time employees health and dental
insurance at the group rate to be paid by the regular long-term part-time
employee.
   (B)   The city may draw specifications for term life insurance, as is now in
effect, in order to provide term life insurance and other benefits for all
regular and full-time employees.  Unless otherwise covered by a contractual
agreement, the amount of life insurance offered to all regular full-time
employees will be equal to $75,000 or to the employee’s annual base salary,
whichever is greater, effective January 1, 2018.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, REGULAR AND FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES is
defined as including all employees who perform prescribed duties on an
established schedule of 40 hours or more per week.  Employees working 20 hours
or more per calendar week schedule are to be considered regular long-term part-
time employees.  Employees working seasonal, limited term, temporary, or an
average of less than 20 hours per calendar week are to be considered part-time
employees and shall be excluded from such insurance programs.
   (D)   Employees working 40 hours or more per week, but in a position which
is intended to exist and continue for only a portion of a calendar year (known
as seasonal employees) shall not be considered regular or full-time employees
or regular long-term part-time employees and shall be excluded from such
insurance programs.
   (E)   Insurance co-payment.
      (1)   Effective January 1, 2009, all employees participating in the
health insurance plan shall, through payroll deduction, contribute 15% of the
cost of the monthly health insurance premium.
      (2)   No deduction shall be made if an employee submits a written
statement 30 days in advance indicating that they do not want to be enrolled in
any city-provided medical insurance plan.
   (F)   Flexible medical benefit.  In order to assist full-time employees who
participate in the health or dental insurance programs for uncovered costs (co-
pays, deductibles, etc.), employees will be eligible for reimbursement of $200
for family coverage or $100 for single coverage annually.  Employees who are
not employed the full year will have this benefit prorated by the number of
months worked during the year (annual benefit amount divided by 12 months times
the number of months worked during the year).
   (G)   Retired government employee part-time stipend. Effective August 1,
2018 and at the City Manager’s discretion, retired government employees who are
hired by the city in a part-time or seasonal capacity, may be eligible to

allowance or similar forfeitures due to their part-time employment status. This
stipend shall not exceed $500 per month.

§ 34.04  SICK LEAVE.
   Sick leave with pay shall be granted to all full-time employees at the rate
of 1-1/4 work days for each full month of active service. An employee on
probationary status may utilize sick leave at the discretion of the department
head who may require a certificate from a licensed physician.
   (A)   Sick leave shall not be considered as a privilege which an employee
may use at his discretion, but shall be allowed only in case of necessary and
actual sickness or disability of the employee, or because of illness in his
immediate family which necessitates his absence from employment.
   (B)   To receive compensation while absent on sick leave, the employee shall
notify his immediate superior prior to the time set for beginning his daily
duties.  The department head may require an employee to furnish a satisfactory
written affidavit to justify the use of sick leave.  If medical attention is
required, or if an employee is absent for more than four consecutive working
days, a certificate stating the nature of the illness from a licensed physician
may be required to justify the use of sick leave with pay.
   (C)   Unused sick leave may be accumulated to a total of not more than 225
working days for regular full-time employees who are normally entitled to
benefits and who are not specifically covered by a labor agreement.  The

the options below:
      (1)   Upon retirement from city service and approval of retirement
benefits in a State of Ohio public employee retirement system, an employee may
be compensated for accumulated sick leave days at the rate of one day's pay for
each two days accumulated with a maximum payment equal to not more than 112.5
days of pay.
      (2)   Upon submitting a resignation for retirement purposes and
acceptance of such resignation by the City Manager, an employee who is eligible
to receive retirement benefits in a state of Ohio public employee retirement
system may take terminal leave at the rate of one day for each two days of
accumulated sick leave (112.5 days maximum leave) immediately preceding the
effective date of resignation. An employee shall not earn sick leave while on
terminal leave.
      (3)   An employee may select only one of the above stated options or the
One-Time Good Attendance Bonus in §
34.041, but may not combine the above stated options.  Upon payment under
option (1) or the exhaustion of terminal leave under option (2), an employee's
sick leave balance will be reduced to zero.
   (D)   An employee who transfers from another public agency to the city shall
be credited with the unused balance of his accumulated sick leave up to the
maximum permitted by the city, upon receipt by the City Manager of a written
statement signed by the employee's previous appointing authority or personnel
officer attesting to the amount of unused accumulated sick leave claimed and
certifying that the individual has not been in any way compensated for the
unused sick leave claimed. This section shall apply to all future employees
only upon their permanent appointment to a position in the city government.  In
the event, however, that the employee has been compensated for unused sick
leave by the previous employer, no such credit balance shall be permitted.
   (E)   Pregnancy is not an illness, however an employee who has accumulated
sick leave may utilize their sick leave during or after their pregnancy if they
are directed by their doctor to quit work, and may continue the use of their
sick leave until they are given permission by their doctor to return to work.

CLASSIFIED SERVICE; CLASSIFICATION PLAN
§ 36.20  CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The classes of positions described in the “Official Position Classification
and Code Index”, as published with such modifications as may be made thereto
from time to time in accordance with these rules, shall constitute the official
classification plan for all positions in the service of the city.  No person
shall be employed or regularly assigned to work under any title not appropriate
to the duties to be performed.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.21  CLASS SPECIFICATIONS.
   The Commission shall maintain in the Human Resources office a record showing
for each class established the class title, the duties performed, authority,
and the responsibilities involved in each class, the minimum qualifications to
be required of applicants seeking appointment, and the standard scale of
compensation.  The official copy of these specifications shall be endorsed with
the date of adoption and the signature or initials of the Secretary or an

specifications adopted under these rules shall be similarly  endorsed.  The
official class specifications shall be open to the public at all times during

(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.22  SPECIFICATIONS INTERPRETED.
   The specifications of classes of positions in the classification plan are
hereby declared to have the following force and effect:
   (A)   They are descriptive and explanatory and are not restrictive.  The use
of a particular expression or illustration as to duties, qualifications, or
other attributes shall not be held to exclude others not mentioned if such
others are similar in kind or quality nor to limit the power of appointing
authorities to modify or alter the detailed tasks involved in the duties of any
position.  When a substantial change of duties is made, except for a temporary
period or by the addition of duties that are incidental to the main employment,
such change shall be reported to the commission with a view to a possible
reclassification of the position.
   (B)   In determining the allocation of a given position the specifications
shall be considered as a whole.  Consideration shall be given to the general
duties and responsibilities, the examples of duties cited, the minimum entrance
qualifications, and relationships to other classes as affording an exclusive
picture of the employment the class is intended to embrace.  Any example cited,
taken with reference to the general duties statement and the qualifications
required shall not be construed as finally determining whether a position shall
be included within the class.
   (C)   Although they may not be mentioned in the specifications, certain
qualifications which should properly apply to practically all positions, such
as honesty, sobriety, diligence, and compatible physical condition, are taken
for granted. The Commission may prescribe minimum and requirements for
applicants for appointment to particular classes.
(Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.23  ALLOCATION OF POSITIONS TO CLASSES.
   Each position in the civil service shall be classified by the Commission
upon recommendation of the City Manager by allocation to the appropriate
class.  The allocation of positions in the unclassified service but controlled
through compensation ordinance or resolutions on the part of the City Council
or independent boards shall be as determined after conference with the
appointing authorities involved.  The allocation of any position to its
appropriate class shall involve the adoption of the class title for all
positions in the class in payroll records, in requests to the Commission for
the certification of eligible, and in all similar employment processes and
documents.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.24  (RESERVED).
§ 36.25  CLASSIFICATION OF NEW POSITIONS.
   Whenever a new classified position is established, the appointing authority
shall report such fact to the Commission and transmit a comprehensive
description of the duties.  The Commission shall thereupon investigate the
actual or suggested duties and qualification requirements and classify or
reclassify the position by allocating it to its appropriate class in accordance
with the classification plan.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.26  RECLASSIFICATION OF POSITIONS.
   The Commission reserves the right to initiate and conduct investigations of
positions in the classified service as such inquiry becomes necessary, and to
propose changes in classification when the facts are considered to warrant such
action.
   (A)   In this connection, the Commission may at any time secure from the
appointing authority or employees involved, new statements of the duties and
responsibilities of the positions under consideration. The appointing authority
and employees concerned shall have an opportunity to be heard before the
revised classification is approved by the Commission.
      Whenever the allocation of a position to a new or different class has
been authorized, the Commission, after conferring with the appointing authority
concerned,shall determine whether the position of the new class shall continue
to be held by the incumbent of the position of the old class through
examination or otherwise, or be filled through a competitive examination. 
Whenever by reason of reorganization of one or more departments, divisions, or
bureaus of the city service, one or more employees in the unclassified service
are not needed or their positions are abolished in such unclassified service,
they or any of them, with the approval of the City Manager and the Commission,
may be transferred to positions with similar duties in the classified service,
in the same or other department, division, or bureau.
      Only employees who have occupied such unclassified service positions for
two (2) years or more may be so transferred to the classified service. 
However, no such transfer shall be made to a position occupied by a regularly
appointed employee in the classified service or to a position for which an
employee is on a preferred eligibility list by reason of layoff.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.27  AMENDMENT OF CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The Commission as it may from time to time deem necessary and after
conference with the appointing authorities involved, may establish new classes,
abolish, merge or divide existing classes and amend the class specifications to
meet changing conditions.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.28  EMPLOYEE RECORD.
   The Human Resources Director shall maintain such employee records as are
necessary to the accomplishment of the various provisions of these rules and
regulations.  These records shall include a central roster of positions and the
record of employment of each employee in the municipal service, including rate
of service, positions held, rate of compensation, vacation, sick leave earned,
and taken, and other such information as may be deemed appropriate by the
Commission.

PAY RANGES; PAY PLAN
§ 36.30  (RESERVED).
§ 36.31  PROMOTION AND RECLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Special assignments.  When a department finds it necessary to place an
employee in a special assignment, such as in charge of a group of other
employees, or to perform special work, it shall request a job study in order to
obtain Commission approval.
   (B)   The Commission determines whether a change from one class to another
is a promotion or a reclassification.  Generally speaking, a change is a
promotion if it results from a promotional examination or from the Commission's
action to promote a person without an examination in the absence of
competition.  A reclassification is usually a change from one title to another
without a change in pay.

ELIGIBILITY LISTS
§ 36.57  POSTING OF LISTS.
   From the results of each examination, the Secretary shall prepare and keep
open to public inspection an eligibility list of the persons whose average
grade in the examination for the class is not less than 70 and who are
otherwise eligible. These persons shall be notified and take rank upon the
eligibility list in the order of their relative grades without reference to
priority of time of examination.  Whenever it becomes necessary to hold a
subsequent examination in order to obtain additional eligible, the Commission
may consolidate existing lists for the same class by rearranging the eligible
names therein according to their grades. Each person whose name appears on an
existing list which is to be merged with a new list shall have an opportunity
to compete in the second examination, and his/her standing on the eligibility
list shall then be determined by his/her grade on the subsequent examination.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)
§ 36.58  DURATION OF LISTS.

be fixed by the Commission at not less than one (1) year nor more than three
(3) years.  Any list that has been in effect for more than one (1) year may be
abolished at any time required in the public interest.

notice from the Secretary, who declines an appointment without reasons
satisfactory to the Human Resources Director, or who cannot be located by the
postal authorities, shall be removed from the eligibility list.  The eligible
shall be notified to this effect unless his/her whereabouts are unknown.  His/
her name may be reinstated on the eligibility list only in case a thoroughly
satisfactory explanation of the circumstances is made to the Human Resources
Director.  In case an eligible's name appears on more than one list, a
permanent appointment to a position in one class shall cause his/her name to be
removed from other eligibility lists for classes the salary of which is equal
or lower.  If the eligibility list in question has resulted from a promotional
examination, resignation from the service shall be cause for removal from the
eligibility list.

   (A)   Immediately on receipt of a written request for certification to fill
a vacancy, the Commission shall certify to the appointing officer from the
eligibility list most nearly appropriate, the names, addresses, and rank of all
persons scoring 90 or more.  If such list does not contain a minimum of ten
(10) names, then the low score limitation shall be reduced one (1) point at a

time until a minimum of ten (10) names are certified for each succeeding
certification. Whenever a vacancy occurs and an eligibility list exists for the
class, the ten (10) persons with the highest ratings shall be certified to the
appointing authority. The appointing authority shall appoint, at his/her
discretion, one of the persons certified to him, to such position.  (Ord. 46-

position is to be filled from the same certification, the number of names
certified will be determined as follows: for two (2) to four (4) vacancies, add
two (2) to the number of vacancies; for five (5) to eight (8) vacancies, add

made from an appropriate eligibility list for the duration of such unusual
work.  If an employee is off duty without pay and needs to be replaced, a
temporary appointment can be made for the duration of the leave of absence.

the position can best be filled by a selection of some designated person of
high and recognized attainments in such qualities, the Commission may suspend

suspension shall be general in its application to such place, and all such
cases of suspension shall be recorded in the minutes of the Commission with the

PROBATIONARY PERIOD
§ 36.80  OBJECTIVE.
   The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part of the
examination process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's

   (B)   Probationary periods shall be set for each class by the Commission,
following consultation with the appropriate appointing authority, at not less
than sixty (60) days nor more than one (1) year.  An extension of the
probationary period may be approved by the Commission on request of the
appointing authority for a period up to a maximum of one (1) year from the date

judgment as to the employee's willingness and ability to perform his/her duties
satisfactorily and as to his/her habits and dependability.  A copy of all such
reports shall be given to the employee and a copy placed in the employee's
personnel file. A failure to do an evaluation of a probationary employee shall
not restrict the right of the appointing authority to terminate an employee for
failing their probationary period.

shall be removed as soon as the fraud or error has been detected.
   (B)   At any time, the appointing authority may remove the employee without
the right of appeal to the Commission if, in his/her opinion, service thus far
in the probationary period indicates that the employee is unable or unwilling
to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily, or that his/her work 
habits and dependability do not merit his/her retention in the service.  Upon
such removal, the appointing authority shall forthwith report his/her actions
and reasons therefor in writing to the Commission.  (Ord. 10-1983, passed 5-4-
83)
   (C)   Any employee failing to qualify in his/her probationary period shall

evaluation form, as to whether the services of the employee have been
satisfactory and whether he/she will continue the employee in his/her
position.  A copy of this performance evaluation form shall be given to the
employee and placed in the employee's personnel file. A failure to do an
evaluation of a probationary employee shall not restrict the right of the
appointing authority to terminate an employee for failing their probationary
period.

PROMOTIONS
§ 36.90  COMMISSION TO RULE ON PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATIONS.
   Vacancies in positions above the lowest rank or grade of any category in the
classified service shall be filled insofar as practical by the promotion of
employees in the classified or unclassified service.  The Commission shall, in
each case, determine whether an open competitive fitness test shall be held, or
a promotional examination held among employees whose previous experience would
be natural preparation for the higher position.  Promotions shall in every case
involve a definite change in duties and an increase in responsibilities, and
shall not be made merely for the purpose of effecting an increase in
compensation.
(Ord. 16-1970, passed 3-2-70; Am. Ord. 04-2012, passed 5-7-12)

serving in other specified classes for such a period as may be prescribed by
the Commission.  A promotional examination may include employees in specified
classes in all departments, or only in the department for which the eligibility
list is being established, as determined by the Commission.  No employee shall
be deemed eligible for a promotional examination who has had  a rating of below
average within the previous forty-eight (48) months.  Whenever a vacancy occurs

with the highest ratings shall be certified to the appointing authority. The
appointing authority shall appoint, at his/her discretion, one of the three
persons certified to him/her, to such position.

application for promotional examination if the applicant has competed in an
open or promotional examination for the same or similar class within six (6)
months previous to the date of the promotional examination. Employees must
satisfactorily complete their probationary period plus two (2) years of
satisfactory service in the position for which they were employed before being
qualified to apply for promotions.

§ 36.94  CHARACTER OF PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATIONS.
   All promotional examinations shall be practical and shall relate directly to
those matters which will fairly test the capacity of the examinee to discharge
the basic duties of the class or position to which promotion is sought.  Each
candidate for a promotional examination can expect to participate in the
following procedures:
   (A)   Performance rating review.
      (1)   The last performance rating for the previous forty- eight (48)
months will be reviewed (see §
36.91 for applicable standards).
      (2)   Probationary rating will not be used unless it is the only rating
of the employee in the classification that deems him/her eligible to
participate in the examination.
      (3)   If the last regular rating has been omitted during the year
preceding the examination, a special performance rating will be obtained.
   (B)   Testing.  One or more of the following tests will be required:
      (1)   Written test.  When appropriate, shall be designed to examine
competitor's basic understanding of the job; his/her ability in the correct
usage of language; and his/her range of general information.
      (2)   Oral test.  When appropriate, shall be designed to examine
candidate's basic ability to respond to unpredictable situations, and problem
solving skills.  Oral tests shall be conducted in the following manner:
         (a)   The examiners must be competent in the kind of work represented
by the job vacancy.
         (b)   The examiners shall not be employees of the city except with
prior approval of the Commission.
         (c)   The same questions will be asked of each applicant, and a
uniform marking system will be used for the answers.
      (3)   Practical performance test.  When appropriate, a test of practical
skills shall be administered.  Such test will be designed to determine
competitive performance capability pertinent to the designated position.  Other
aspects to be considered are:
         (a)   Should a position require two (2) or more distinct skills, the
Commission may request a separate test for each skill.  An accumulative minimum
grade shall be established.
         (b)   Any candidate who fails to attain a minimum accumulative grade
shall not be considered for further testing.
   (C)   Seniority.  This part shall consist of a credit awarded to each
competitor on the basis of his continuous service with the city.
      (1)   Any employee whose city service is interrupted only by military
service shall receive credit for seniority on the basis of his combined city
and military service.
      (2)   Twelve months:  one point.
         Twenty-four months:  three points.
         Thirty-six months:  five points.

notice of his/her examination grade, to the civil service secretary.  The civil
service secretary shall schedule an inspection period, which shall not exceed
four (4) hours, within three (3) days of receipt of the written request.  A
candidate may file a written protest to any question or answer provided that
the candidate sets forth the basis upon which the candidate protests the
questions or the answer.  A candidate may also claim that his/her examination
was incorrectly graded.  The civil service secretary may correct clerical
grading errors, and shall report such corrections to the Commission.  The civil
service secretary shall review protests of questions or answers and make a
recommendation to the Commission.  The Commission shall review all protests and
objections at a regular session. The Commission's decision is final and is not
subject to the appeal process.
   (B)   This rule does not apply to examinations prepared by experts, or
otherwise commercially produced by persons outside of city service, when the
preparer objects to inspection of the examination papers.
   (C)   Candidates who exercise their right to inspect examination papers may
not compete on an examination for the same classification for a period of six
(6) months after the inspection, unless an alternative form of examination is
given.

exceptional qualifications of a scientific, managerial, professional, or
education character, and the appointing authority established in writing to the
satisfaction of the Commission that only one subordinate employee of the
department has such qualifications, promotion may be approved under the
appropriate section of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   If a position has been established with advance approval of the
Commission, for the purpose of training an employee for promotion to a higher
position, and the selection of the incumbent of the training position has been
made with due regard for the requirements of the higher position, the
Commission may, on recommendation of the appointing authority, approve such
promotion without examination upon completion of suitable training.  These
advance requests will not be considered favorably unless an examination has
been held in an effort to fill the position at the proper classification, and
unless the training position is the only one of its classification in the
department.

INTRODUCTION
§ 51.00  GENERAL.
   The purpose of the Stormwater Management Code contained in this chapter is
to provide for effective management and financing of a stormwater system within
the city.
   (A)   In order to accomplish the purpose of effective management of a
stormwater system within the city, the Code shall:
      (1)   Provide for administration, operation, maintenance and inspection
of existing stormwater management facilities;
      (2)   Provide for the establishment and implementation of a master plan
for future stormwater management facilities;
      (3)   Provide procedures for design, construction and inspection of
proposed stormwater management facilities; and
      (4)   Protect the public health, safety and welfare by providing a
mechanism for mitigating the damaging effects of existing uncontrolled and
unplanned stormwater runoff.
   (B)   In order to accomplish the purpose of effective financing of a
stormwater system within the city, the Code shall:
      (1)   Establish and maintain fair and reasonable stormwater management
service charges for each lot or parcel in the city which bear a substantial
relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and
facilities.  Such service charges shall be proportional to each property's
contribution to runoff and its use and benefit of services and facilities;
      (2)   Ensure that similar properties pay similar stormwater management
service charges which reflect the area of each property and its intensity of
development, since these factors bear directly on the peak rate of stormwater
runoff.
         Charges for residential properties of two or less dwelling units shall
reflect the relatively uniform effect that such development has on runoff.
Charges for all other properties shall be in proportion to residential
properties of two or less dwelling units, utilizing both relative area and
intensity of development in setting rates;
      (3)   Provide a mechanism for consideration of specific or unusual
service requirements of some properties, and special and general benefits
accruing to or from properties as a result of providing their own stormwater
management facilities;
      (4)   Provide for a service charge adjustment process to review
stormwater charges when unusual circumstances exist which alter runoff
characteristics, when either service or benefit varies from a normal condition
or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff or to periodically
ensure that rates reflect the current costs of effective stormwater management;
and
      (5)   Utilize stormwater management funds throughout the city, except
where activities or facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of the normal
level of service city-wide and that developers are responsible for providing
any new stormwater facilities required for their project.
   (C)   In order to maintain the effectiveness of the Stormwater Management
Code, it shall:
      (1)   Establish a mechanism for appeals and amendments to its provisions;
      (2)   Provide a procedure for abatement of conditions or activities which
are not in the interest of public health, safety or welfare;
      (3)   Provide for its continuous validity through severability of its
various portions; and
      (4)   Provide penalties for violations of its provisions.

§ 51.14  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
   (A)    System required.
      (1)    Every subdivision and land development shall be provided with a
comprehensive stormwater management system which is adequate to serve the area
and meets the requirements of this chapter, the Stormwater Management Design
Manual and other criteria of the city. Two separate and distinct drainage
systems exist:
         (a)    A minor drainage system for collecting and transporting runoff
from frequently occurring storms. It includes watercourses, streets, curbs and
gutters, and underground storm sewers, manholes, catch basins, and culverts.
This system's purpose is to lessen or eliminate inconveniences and safety and
health hazards associated with frequent storms. Except where indicated
otherwise, design criteria and requirements of this chapter are directed to the
minor drainage system.
         (b)    A major drainage system for ensuring that stormwater runoff
which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to follow
that will not cause any loss of property or any loss of life. It must be
recognized that the major drainage system exists even when it is not planned
and whether or not physical facilities are intelligently located in respect to
it.
   (B)    Rate of runoff.
      (1)   Developers are required to design improvements such that after
development, the rate of stormwater runoff leaving the project area at
strategic points is no more than if the project area had remained undeveloped.
If necessary, detention/retention facilities shall be constructed to assure
that this requirement is met.
      (2)   Where a portion of the project area contains existing development
features such as buildings, streets, parking lots, sidewalks, driveways, and
the like, and a permit application is made for additional development, the area
to be considered in determining the rate of stormwater runoff shall be only
that on which the additional development is sought. However, any development in
the project area constructed after August 2, 1979 (the effective date of the
requirement for restricting stormwater runoff to the rate prior to development)
without an approved plan shall be considered as part of the additional
development.
      (3)    The City Engineer may reduce or waive requirements for an
individual detention/retention basin if a common or regional basin of adequate
design is available or if the Utility is reasonably certain one will be
constructed and if the major drainage system from the project area to such
common or regional basin is such that the public health, safety, and welfare
will not be in jeopardy.
         If this option is exercised, the developer will be billed in
accordance with the standard utility rate structure.
      (4)   Stormwater management systems will be designed for the ultimate use
of the land and shall be capable of conveying runoff originating upstream as
determined by the City Engineer.
   (C)   Easements and underdrains.
      Where a storm sewer, culvert, open channel, catch basin, inlet, manhole
or other drainage structure lies outside the public right-of-way, easements of
sufficient size as determined by the City Engineer shall be provided to assure
easy access and maintenance.

§ 51.15  PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   The following principles are effective in minimizing erosion and
sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in plans:
      (1)   Stripping of vegetation, re-grading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion.  Whenever feasible, natural
vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
grading operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as to
create the least erosion potential;
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum. The
topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be re-
vegetated, or new topsoil will be provided, or the surface shall be covered
with sod;
      (4)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical with
temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during
development;
      (5)   The permanent vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development;
      (6)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
stormwater runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, detention/retention basins shall be
provided according to the requirements of this chapter and the Stormwater
Management Design Manual; and
      (7)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped by the use of
sediment basins or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized.
   (B)    The following standards shall be followed in preparing plans:
      (1)    All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding, and all land
within a project area shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water
without ponding, except where approved by the City Engineer. Each lot shall be
graded such that water from the lot drains to natural streams, swales, or other
watercourses, or storm sewers but not to an adjacent lot if the rate of runoff
to that lot is increased;
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the surface runoff according to the Stormwater Management Design Manual;
      (3)   Concentration of stormwater runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses;
      (4)   The installation of the specific stormwater management measures
shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards and specifications
contained in the Stormwater Management Design Manual or as recommended by the
Hamilton County SWCD;
      (5)   During the construction phase, further consultative technical
assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the City Engineer or by the
Hamilton County SWCD, and the Director shall enforce compliance with the
approved plans.
   (C)   The approved plan required of the landowner or his agent under this
chapter shall include, but not be restricted to the following:
      (1)   A vicinity sketch and boundary line survey of the project area;
      (2)   Location of all existing buildings, structures, utilities, storm
and sanitary sewers and waterlines in the project area;
      (3)   Location of all trees as required by Ordinance 32-1988 (tree
preservation ordinance).  If there are no trees, the note so stating shall be
placed on the plans;
      (4)   Location of any building or structure (on land of adjacent property
owners) within 50 feet of the project area;
      (5)   Elevations, contours, dimensions, locations, and extent of all work
proposed to be done within 50 feet of the project area, the existing elevations
and contours of the land all in increments of two feet, and proposed ground
cover for areas not covered by buildings, structures or pavement;
      (6)   Soil type if required by the City Engineer;
      (7)   A certification of the quantity of cut and fill involved;
      (8)   Detailed plans of all proposed stormwater provisions, retaining
walls, vegetative practices, erosion and sediment control measures, location of
fences around sediment basins, detention/retention basins or steep excavations
and other protective devices to be constructed in connection with, or as a part
of the proposed work;
      (9)   Provisions for maintenance of erosion and sediment control
facilities including easements to ensure short as well as long term erosion and
sediment control;
      (10)   A map showing the drainage area of land tributary to the project
area and estimated runoff of the area served by any drainage structure or
watercourse, computed in accordance with stormwater management criteria as
outlined in this chapter and in the Stormwater Management Design Manual; and
      (11)   The estimated cost of all the required stormwater management
items.
   (D)   The Planning Commission and the City Manager shall make a continuing
review and evaluation of the methods used and overall effectiveness of the
provisions of this section.

§ 51.19  PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   To further the specific purposes of this chapter, the following procedures
are established:
   (A)   The Utility shall assist all other departments in the review of plans
submitted with applications for permits for development.
   (B)    Where a permit is required, the City Engineer and the SWCD shall
review the application and plan for the proposed permit. If the City Engineer
and the Director find the application and plans in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter, the Community Development Department may issue a
permit with such reasonable conditions as the City Engineer deems necessary to
substantially secure the objectives of this chapter.
   (C)    Approved plans, specifications, and reports for all site development
shall be retained in original form or other means approved by the Utility.
   (D)    Every permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if
the work authorized by such permit has not commenced within 180 days, or is not
completed within one year from the date of issue.  The Director may grant a
reasonable extension of time if the permit holder presents satisfactory
evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or
completed within the specified time limits and if written application is made
before the expiration date of the permit.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.20  INSPECTIONS.
   (A)    An approved plan bearing the City Engineer's stamp of approval shall
be maintained at the site, along with any required permit, during the progress
of the work.
   (B)   Inspection and notification procedures and time allowed to correct
deficiencies shall be as established by the City Engineer.
   (C)    The Inspector shall inspect the work covered by the plan and permit.
At any stage of construction when conditions are not as stated or shown on the
plan, the Director, with the approval of the City Manager, may order further
work stopped until approval is obtained for a revised plan conforming to
existing conditions.
   (D)    If at any stage of the work the Inspector determines that the
conditions are such that further work as authorized by the existing permit is
likely to imperil any person, property, public way, watercourse, or drainage
structure, the Inspector may require, as a condition to allowing the work to
proceed, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as considered
available to avoid the likelihood of such peril. Where it appears that storm
damage may result because the grading is not complete, the Director, with the
approval of the City Manager, may order work to be stopped and the developer
required to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary
structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining
property or the public safety.
   (E)   Where no permit has been required and it is evident that construction
and grading has caused the existing surface drainage in the general area to be
impaired, created an erosion hazard or become a source of sediment to any
adjacent land or watercourse, the Director shall:
      (1)   Have the Developer verbally notified to take measures necessary to
correct the situation within a specific length of time, or
      (2)   Take immediate action, if necessary to protect persons or property
from damage - by causing corrective measures to be taken and charging the
Developer for all coast incurred by the city as a result of such action;
      (3)   Have the corrective measures performed by other that the developer,
with the incurred expense charged to the developer, if not completed by the
developer within the specified time period;
      (4)   recommended to the City Manager that the Building Department
withhold the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for all structures on the
project area until all costs incurred by the city have been paid in full the by
developer.

inspections, as-built plan review and inspections, and the like, shall be
established by Council.
   (B)    Bonds. In order to insure that emergency or corrective measures may
be taken by the city if the stormwater management measures are not implemented
according to the agreed upon plan and schedule, a performance bond in the
amount approved by the City Engineer to be sufficient to cover the cost of the
stormwater management measures shall be required to be filed with the City
Manager. The performance bond shall authorize immediate payment to the city on
certification by the City Manager that necessary emergency or corrective work
must be done or has to be done to ensure proper water management and sediment
control as a result of the landowner's failure to complete or adhere to the
approved plan.

pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the permit, or conducts site
development in such a manner as to adversely affect the heal, safety or welfare
of person residing or working in the neighborhood of the Project Area, or
property, or whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, plans, or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based, the City Manager shall temporarily suspend the
Permit.
   (B)    Procedure for revoking the permit. No permit shall be permanently
revoked or suspended until a hearing is held by the City Manager or his
designate.  Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the developer
either personally or by registered mail, and shall state:
      (1)    The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation or
suspension, in clear and concise language; and
      (2)    The time when, and the place where such hearing is to be held. At
any such hearing, the permit holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard,
and may call witnesses and present evidence on his behalf. On conclusion of
such hearing, the City Manager or his designate shall determine whether or not
the permit shall be suspended or revoked and shall issue, in writing, a notice
of revocation. No part of any fee for such revoked permit shall be returned.
   (C) A   fter a temporary suspension is received, each and any act of
proceeding with any operation for which such permit was issued shall be
considered a violation of this section pending permanent revocation by the City
Manager.

(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.25  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE CHARGE.
   A stormwater management service charge is imposed on each lot and parcel of
land within the city, and the owner thereof, excepting only streets,
boulevards, sidewalks, curbing, street crossings, grade separations, and other
public ways and easements, and highway structures belonging to the city, state
and federal government. 
   (A)    Vacant land shall be exempt from stormwater management service
charges.
   (B)    Public road and freeway rights-of-way shall be exempt from the
stormwater management service charge because they function as part of the
stormwater collection and conveyance system. Private rights-of-way will be
charged as described herein.
   (C)    Properties that have existing stormwater detention facilities, or
those planning such facilities, may have their stormwater management service
charges reduced as determined by the Utility, in accordance with generally
accepted engineering standards and practices to more accurately reflect the
contribution to runoff from the property and the level of service provided to
such property. The detention facilities must be in accord with the hydrologic,
hydraulic, and structural design requirements of the rules and regulations.
Facilities of a temporary nature will not be allowed a decrease in their
charges.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.26  CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY.
   There shall be two classifications of property for determination of the
stormwater management service charge:
   (A)    Class R.
   One- and two-family residential properties. Typically, these types of
property comprise about 9,600 square feet total, are assigned an Area Range
Number (ARN) of 5 and an Intensity of Development Factor (IDF) of 0.25.
   (B)    Class C.
   All non-residential property and residential property not included in Class
R. The gross area (total square footage) of each Class C property will be
determined by any one or more means defined in §
51.01. Such property sizes shall be grouped in 2,000 square foot ranges and
assigned an Area Range Number (ARN).
   For example, a Class C property with a total square footage of 12,600 square
feet shall be assigned an Area Range Number (ARN) of 7.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.27  LAND USE INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT FACTORS.
   Eight land uses are identified and recognized for purposes of this chapter,
each of which has an assigned Intensity of Development Factor (IDF). The land
use of each Class C property shall be assigned based on the records of the
County Recorder or Auditor, the city or through field examination or
photogrammetric analysis.
   Land-Use      IDF
   Commercial      .85
   Industrial      .75
   Multi-family      .60
   Public-institutional   .40
   Residential      .25
   Agriculture      .08
   Park         .05
   Vacant         .00
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.28  RATES.
   The Utility is directed to prepare a list of all lots and parcels within the
city and assign a classification as set forth in §
51.26 to each. All properties included in Class C shall be assigned an ARN and
IDF. The Utility shall report, to the City Manager, any applications of the
provisions of §§
51.25 through
51.27, which the Utility considers unjust or inequitable, and the matter shall
be resolved in accordance with the provisions of §
51.30. Where agreements exist, prior to the adoption of this chapter, between
the city and a developer fixing rates for lots and parcels, such rates shall be
applied by the Utility in lieu of the provisions of this chapter until the
agreements are terminated or the terms therein are otherwise no longer valid.
The rates for the two classes of property shall be as follows:
   (A)    Class R. The monthly stormwater management service charge for Class R
lots and parcels shall be $3.
   (B)    Class C. The monthly stormwater management service charge for Class C
lots and parcels shall be calculated as follows, but shall not be less than the
monthly stormwater management service charge for Class R lots and parcels:
      Multiply the ARN of each lot or parcel times the IDF of the lot or
parcel. Divide this figure by the typical Class R property ARN and IDF.
Multiply this figure times the monthly charge per Class R property. This
calculation may be phrased as follows:
   (ARN) X (IDF) X ($3.00)  = $   Monthly Stormwater
     (5) X (.25)            Management Service Charge
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.29  COLLECTION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE CHARGE.
   The stormwater management service charge shall be paid, by the owner of each
lot or parcel which is subject to this charge, on a periodic basis in
accordance with regulations established herein.
   Owners of Class R properties shall be billed by the City of Cincinnati Water
Works in monthly or quarterly installments coinciding with the water utility
billing cycle for each property. For quarterly billing, three times the monthly
rate will be used for standard billing periods and adjusted for longer or
shorter billing periods to assure total annual billing equal to 12 times the
monthly rate. Owners of Class C properties shall continue to be billed by the
City of Forest Park quarterly at a rate three times the monthly service charge
on or about February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year.

§ 51.30  ADJUSTMENT CHARGE, APPEAL.
   (A)   Anytime the runoff situation on a parcel of property changes, the
stormwater utility reserves the right to correspondingly adjust the Stormwater
Management service charge.
   (B)   Persons who consider the charges applicable to their lot or parcel to
be unjust or inequitable may apply, within 30 days after receipt of the charge,
to the City Manager for adjustment thereof, stating in writing the grounds of
the complaint according to procedures and requirements set forth by the City
Manger.
   (C)   The City Manager shall, within 30 days, cause appropriate
investigation thereof and determine whether an adjustment of the charges for
any such lot or parcel is necessary to provide for the just and equitable
application of the stormwater management service charge, and adjust such charge
if appropriate.
   (D)   No refunds shall be given. Any overpayment shall be applied as credit
to the next subsequent billing. The foregoing not withstanding, the city
manager is granted the discretionary authority to order a refund, including but
not limited to an amount of $5 or less, where deemed to be reasonable and
appropriate.

§ 51.31  DELINQUENT CHARGES.
   (A)   All Class C charges not under appeal and not paid within 30 days after

   (B)   All Class C charges delinquent hereunder shall:
      (1)   Be subject to an interest charge established by Council;

   (C)   Class C charges which remain unpaid for a period of 60 days may be
reported to the City Manager for assessment against the real property or for
the filing of a suit by the City Law Director, to collect the unpaid charges.
   (D)   Forest Park agrees that Cincinnati shall charge the same late fee for
all Class R stormwater collection payments as is applied to all Cincinnati
consumers’ water charges. The current late fee for these charges is
approximately 10% per year. Forest Park agrees that should the late fees
applied to all Cincinnati retail water charges be increased by Cincinnati City
Council to its consumers, the same rate increase shall be applied to Forest
Park Class R stormwater collection fees without amendment to this Agreement
after notification to Forest Park of said fee increase.
   (E)   For delinquent charges, a special assessment may be filed with the
Auditor of Hamilton County, Ohio as a lien upon the real property.

ABATEMENT PROCEDURES
§ 51.32  NOTICE TO CORRECT IMPROPER DRAINAGE.
   (A)    Whenever the Utility shall find that a tract of land is inadequately
drained, or that there is an obstruction to a culvert, or water course that
interferes with water naturally flowing therein or that such culvert, storm
sewer or watercourse is of insufficient capacity to reasonably accommodate the
flow of water, as required by this chapter, the Utility shall notify the owner
or person having possession charge, or management of such land to remove the
obstruction or provide adequate drainage.  Such notice shall be served on such
persons by personal delivery, by registered mail at the last known place of
residence, or by posting on the premises.
   (B)    The owner must comply with the Utility's orders within the time
specified and not to exceed 30 days. Failure to comply with such order shall
constitute an unlawful act. Each additional day thereafter during which the
owner fails to carry out the order of the Utility shall constitute a separate
offense.
      (1)   In any case where a condition described in §
51.32 exists for more than 30 days after service of notice, the City Manager
may direct the owner to fill or drain such land, remove any obstruction and, if
necessary, enlarge the culverts, drains, or watercourses to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   In the event an owner fails or refuses to comply with the City
Manager's directive, the Utility may provide for the performance of the
required work and charge the owner the abatement costs.
   (C)    Failure of the city to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend denial of a permit shall not relieve the developer
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the city, its officers or agents being responsible for any
condition or damage resulting therefrom.
   (D)    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any person
to maintain a private or public nuisance on his property, and compliance with
the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent immediate
action by the Utility in emergency situations.  In case of an emergency, the
Utility may direct that action be taken immediately to correct the condition or
abate the activity to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.  The
Utility may perform the required work and charge the owner the abatement costs.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)  Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.33  ABATEMENT COSTS.
   The Utility shall account for all costs associated with an emergency or
abatement including, but not limited to, administration, notification,
inspection, serving of papers or documents, legal counsel, force account labor,
enforcement, operational services, and outside contracted services. These costs
shall be billed at the discretion of the City Manager.
   This section shall not be construed to relieve the owner of any penalties
prescribed by other sections of this chapter.

filed under §
51.36(A).
   The Appeals Board shall, in harmony with the general purpose of this chapter
and to secure the public health, safety and welfare, have the power to affirm,
modify, or revoke any notice or order and may grant an extension of time for
the performance of any act required by this chapter, or may grant a variance,
except as otherwise excluded herein, where there is practical difficulty or
undue hardship connected with the performance of such notice or order, and its
decision shall be final.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.35  VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   Any person may appeal decisions or interpretations of the City Manager, or
his designee, issued in connection with the enforcement of any provisions of
this chapter or request variances therefrom, provided that such person shall
file in the office of the City Manager, along with the fees established by
Council for appeals and variances, a written petition to either the Appeals
Board or the Planning Commission as provided below.
   (A)   The Planning Commission.  As authorized by Article VII of the Charter
of the City of Forest Park, the Planning Commission shall have the exclusive
power to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of §§
51.13, -
51.19 of this chapter.
   Upon receipt of such a petition as required in §
51.36 the required fee(s), the Planning Commission shall set a time and place
for the public hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At
the hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and show
cause why any decision, interpretation or any item appearing on a notice or
order should be modified or withdrawn or a variance granted.
   After a public hearing, the Planning Commission may approve the variance
request, approve the variance request with such conditions it deems necessary,
deny the variance request, or such other action as is appropriate.  Should the
petitioner not be satisfied with the decision of the Planning Commission, the
petitioner may appeal the decision to the Appeals Board.
   (B)    The Appeals Board. The Appeals Board shall hear and determine appeals
or variances to all other sections of this chapter and, upon receipt of a
petition setting forth the requirements of §
51.36 and the required fee(s), the Appeals Board shall set a time and place for
a public hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At the
hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and show
cause why any decision, interpretation or any item appearing on a notice or
order should be modified or denied or a variance granted.
   After a hearing, the Appeals Board shall sustain, modify or deny any item
appealed or grant a variance by majority vote, depending on its findings as to
whether the provisions of this chapter have been complied with, and the
petitioner and the City Manager shall be notified in writing of such findings.
   The proceedings at such hearings, including the findings and decision of the
Appeals Board and reasons therefor, shall be summarized and reduced to writing
and entered as a matter of public record in the office of the City Manager. The
record shall also include a copy of every notice, order or variance issued in
connection with the matter.
   (C)    The failure of the petitioner or his representative to appear and
state his case at any hearing shall have the same effect as if no petition had
been filed.
   (D)    Filing fees required by this section shall be in addition to the
payment of the permits and inspection fees and any other fee which thereafter
may occur, and no portion of such filing fee shall be refunded whatever the
outcome of the appeal unless such petition shall have been withdrawn prior to
the date set for such hearing.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.36  CONTENTS OF PETITION.
   The complainant shall set forth in the petition for appeal, the
interpretation, ruling or order appealed from, and the related provisions of
this chapter or related laws or ordinances, and shall state wherein the
interpretation, ruling, or order is erroneous. If the appeal is a request for
variance, the petition shall point out the provision or provisions from which
the variance is sought and how the request satisfies the requirements of this
section.
   (A)    The Planning Commission, in hearing requests for a variance filed in
accordance with §
51.35(A), shall grant no variance in the application of any of the provisions
of the sections listed therein, unless it finds all of the following:
      (1)    That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record that it
is impossible or impractical for the subdivider or developer to comply with all
of the regulations of these sections;
      (2)    That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully
described in the Planning Commission's findings, applying to the land for which
the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such
land and do not apply generally in the city, and that said circumstances or
conditions are such that the strict applications of the provisions of these
sections would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land and
that the variance as granted by the Planning Commission is the minimum variance
that will accomplish this purpose;
      (3)    That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of these sections and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, the city, or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety
and welfare;
      (4)    That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property
for which a variance is sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as
to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
condition or situation;
      (5)    That the special conditions or circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant; and
      (6)    That no permitted use of lands in other areas of the city are used
as grounds for issuance of such a variance.
   (B)    Petitions to the Appeals Board, in appeals filed in accordance with §
51.35(B), may only be based on one of the following grounds:
      (1)    The interpretation, ruling, or order is erroneous or constitutes
an erroneous application of the particular provisions of this chapter or other
related laws or ordinances pertaining to stormwater management and finance, or
is otherwise contrary to law; or
      (2)    A variance is necessary and feasible and meets all of the
following conditions:
         (a)    Good and sufficient cause based on an unreasonable burden or
hardship has been proven;
         (b)    The degree of variance is the minimum necessary to afford
relief from the unreasonable burden or hardship imposed by this chapter or
standards, specifications, requirements, regulations, and procedures adopted
pursuant to this chapter;
         (c)    The variance may be granted without defeating the public
health, safety, and welfare purposes and intent of this chapter or related laws
or ordinances pertaining to stormwater management and finance.
(Ord. 04-1990, passed 3-5-90)
§ 51.37  AMENDMENTS.

   Floods from stormwater runoff may occasionally occur which exceed the
capacity of storm drainage facilities constructed, operated, or maintained by
funds made available under this chapter. This chapter does not imply that
property subject to the fees and charges established herein will always be free
from stormwater flooding or flood damage, or that stormwater systems capable of
handling all storm events can be cost effectively constructed, operated, or
maintained. Nor shall this chapter create a liability on the part of, or cause
of action against, the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that may result from such storms or the runoff thereof.  Nor does this
chapter purport to reduce the need or the necessity for obtaining flood
insurance.

court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions of this chapter. Council declares that it would have
passed this chapter and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase
hereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more of the sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases hereof be declared invalid or
unconstitutional.

CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION; APPLICATIONS
§ 52.035  NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in

limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with this chapter and all laws including any rules and regulations
adopted by the Public Works Director. The rights to locate facilities and/or a
system in and the rights to occupy the right-of-way itself may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however provider may sublease capacity (or
other nonmaterial facility aspects) and two or more providers may collocate
facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such provider
complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating providers may file a
joint application for a Right-of-Way Permit. A Certificate of Registration does
not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including
the city's facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a
provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the
sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the
provisions of this chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable
law.

copies of such documents to the city. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to or interfere with the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines,
pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property of any
kind whatsoever under the management or control of the city.

Registration, and upon the reasonable request of the Public Works Director, a
provider shall be required to provide to the city any additional location
information for any facilities which it owns or over which it has control that

information to comport with the city's then current standard format (whether
electronic or otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must be timely
remitted by, the provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within 60 days of

shall use best efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the
providers that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping
requirements. When the mapping requirements of this chapter are amended, each
provider shall be served with a copy of the new specifications or modifications
by regular U.S. mail to the System Representative identified in each
Certificate of Registration and in accordance with this chapter; provided,
however, that any failure of any provider to actually receive such notice shall

§ 52.143  RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT FEES.
   A permit fee, as listed in the Codified Ordinances,
Chapter 156, §
156.14 entitled Fees for Work in the Public Rights of Way, shall be charged for
the issuance of each Right-of-Way Permit.
   (A)   Beginning on January 1, 2005, the city shall annually calculate Right-
of-Way Permit Fees and appropriately revise §
156.14 based upon the formula and calculations described in this section.
Right-of-Way Permit Fees in place as of January 1, 2005, shall remain in effect
until the city's next annual modification.
   (B)   The city, on or about January 1 of each year, shall calculate all the
actual and incurred Right-of-Way Permit issuance, inspection, oversight,
enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year including the
value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the rights-of-way
that will result from construction that takes place therein. DEGRADATION AND
THE REDUCTION IN THE USEFUL LIFE for the purpose of this section means the
accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way caused by construction in or
disturbance of the rights-of-way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or
repair such rights-of-way earlier than would be required if the construction
did not occur.
   (C)   The city, on or about January 1 of each year, shall total all the
Right-of-Way Permit Fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled fees
required by §
156.14 for the previous calendar year.
   (D)   The city shall divide the calculated costs referenced in division (B)
of this section by the total Right-of-Way Permit Fees received as referenced in
division (C) of this section to arrive at a numerical factor representing the
previous years cost versus receipts analysis.
   (E)   The city shall multiply the then currently codified Permit Fees in §
156.14 by the numerical factor as referenced in division (D) of this section to
calculate revised Permit Fees for the new calendar year.
   (F)   The city shall act, on or about January 31 of each year, in accordance
with the results of division (E) of this section, to codify new annual Permit
Fees by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous years Permit Fees
as then listed on the schedules contained in §
156.14. Revised Permit Fees shall be effective upon passage. Any permit
requests pending on the date of any Permit Fee modification shall be subject to
all new Permit Fees as modified.
   (G)   No Right-of-Way Permit shall be issued without payment of Right-of-Way
Permit Fees except to the city which shall be exempt. Right-of-Way Permit Fees
that were paid for a permit that the city has revoked due to breach and in
accordance with the terms of this chapter are not refundable.
   (H)   The current schedule of Right-of-Way Permit Fees is available from the
Public Works Department.

CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION
§ 52.155  TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   Prior to commencement of any initial construction of facilities in the
rights-of-way a Right-of-Way Permittee, upon the reasonable request of the
Public Works Director, shall provide technical information about the proposed
route of construction. The technical information required may consist of
completion of the following tasks:
   (A)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location data
indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along the
proposed construction route.
   (B)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
   (C)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way
along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of the Public
Works Director, a permittee shall also record and identify the general location
of all other facilities in the rights-of-way along the proposed system route.
For the purposes of this section, general location shall mean the alignment of
other facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth
of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (D)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the tasks
described in divisions (A) through (C) of this section on the Right-of-Way
Permittee's proposed system route maps, construction plans, plan sheets or
computer aided drafting and design (CADD) files, or other data files in a
format compatible with that used by the city.
   (E)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of existing
underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted, Right-of-
Way Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive digging
methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified to
determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless approved by the Public Works Director, a Right-of-Way
Permittee shall not excavate more than a three foot by three foot square hole
in the rights-of-way to complete this task.
   (F)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
   (G)   Upon completion of the tasks described in this section, the Right-of-
Way Permittee shall plot and incorporate the data on the permittee's proposed
system route maps, construction plans, plan sheets or CADD files, or other data
files in the best and most advanced format available to both the city and
provider and deliver a copy to the Public Works Department.
   (H)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein shall be so
labeled.

   (A)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
   (B)   The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right of way is
full. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year, the protection of
existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future city and county plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
   (C)   Upon the concurrence of the city, or if it is determined by the Right-
of-Way Permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or other
entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the rights-of-
way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or taller poles
in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems only after the Right-
of-Way Permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an acceptable solution
without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This division shall not
apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with identically sized pole(s)
which results from the destruction of or hazardous condition of the existing
pole(s) as long as no new facilities or additional facilities are attached.

§ 52.161  RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   A provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate
its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the city finds it necessary to
request such removal and relocation. In instances where the city requests
removal and/or relocation, the city shall waive all applicable Right-of-Way
Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the
rights-of-way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately
prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the city. The Public Works Director may request relocation and/or
removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's
facilities with:
      (1)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the city or county;
      (2)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right of way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the city, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.04.01.
   (C)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the city, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the city, within 30 days after the city's removal order is served upon
provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the city, within 90
days thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the
city shall have the right to:
      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the city with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
      (2)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city at provider's cost and expense,
by another person, however the city shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the city for all
reasonable costs incurred by the city in such action; and
      (3)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city
designated by the city for removal and not timely removed by tile provider
shall belong to and become the property of the city without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
city shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the city, to evidence
such ownership by the city.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 12-20-04)
§ 52.162  PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has
facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the
horizontal and make every reasonable attempt using best efforts, to mark the
approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. All providers shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to
establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
(Ord. 24-2004, passed 12-20-04)
§ 52.163  RIGHTS-OF-WAY RESTORATION.
   (A)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
Public Works Director, subject to any applicable laws. The permittee must also
inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same
condition for 12 months thereafter. If a permittee is unable to timely complete
the restoration of rights-of-way due to unreasonable inclement weather
conditions, the permittee shall complete the restoration of the rights-of-way
as soon as weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said
completion notify the city.
   (B)   In approving an application for a permit, the city may choose either
to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or alternatively to restore the
rights-of-way itself if the permittee has in the past not abided by the
requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   If the city chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-way,
Right-of-Way Permittee shall at the time of application of a Right-of-Way
Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the city to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to construction. If, 12 months
after completion of the restoration of the rights-of-way, the city determines
that the rights-of-way have been properly restored, the surety on the
Construction Bond shall be released.
   (D)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the city. The city shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
city in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights-of-way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work.
   (E)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this
12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the Public Works Department,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required
by the Public Works Department. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Public Works Department.
   (F)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner and
to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the city, the city, at its option, with notice
to provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that event, the
permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of
restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the city. Upon
failure to pay, the city may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by
permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.

§ 52.164  DAMAGE TO PROVIDER'S FACILITIES AND TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts
to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the city performs work
in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs associated
therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within 30 days from
the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the city may pursue all legal and
equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the city may call
upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and pursue any and all
legal or equitable remedies.
   (B)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the city's response to an
emergency caused by such provider's facilities.

the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health,
safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms
and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
   (D)   The inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in §
52.238. An order may be appealed to the Public Works Director. The decision of
the Public Works Director may be appealed to the BZA whose decision shall be
final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the
provider shall present proof to the Public Works Director that the violation
has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required
time, the Public Works Director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
52.194.

committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit, the Public Works Director shall serve a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon

additional or revised conditions on the permit.
   (C)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Public Works Director
with a plan, acceptable to the Public Works Director, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Public Works Director, or the permittee's
failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the
permit.
   (D)   From time to time, the Public Works Director may establish a list of
standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall
also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way as defined in §
52.110.
   (E)   If a permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined above,
permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further
permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.

§ 53.01  INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The goal of the Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program is
to detect and eliminate illicit connections and illegal discharges to the storm
drainage system.  Illicit of improper connections to the storm drain system
from industrial facilities, commercial establishments and even residential
property have been detected in many municipalities.  Often, illicit discharges
are found in older industrial, commercial and residential structures and
buildings, with the property owner unaware that sanitary wastewater is being
improperly discharged into the storm drain.  Occasionally, these illicit
connections are intentional.  Illegal discharges, via direct discharge or
runoff to the storm sewer from industrial facilities, commercial businesses and
residents, can be a significant source of water pollution.  For example,
illegal discharges may include chemical spills that flow to a gutter or creek,
the dumping of motor oil into the street or gutter or the discharge of wash
water from restaurants to storm drains.
   (B)   The objectives of the city's Illicit Discharge Detection and
Elimination Program are to:
      (1)   Detect and eliminate illicit connections to the storm drain system
by conducting periodic field investigations and sampling.
      (2)   Correct conditions where sanitary sewer or storm drain piping has
deteriorated causing seepage and infiltration into these systems.
      (3)   Detect and eliminate the illegal disposal of wastes to the storm
drain system through a program that combines education, alternative disposal
options and enforcement.
   (C)   This program is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance,
rule, regulation or other provision of law.  The requirements of this program
are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or
provision of law.  Where any requirement of this program imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or
provision of law, whichever requirement is more restrictive or imposes higher
protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.02  PROGRAM ELEMENTS.
   The Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program includes the
following elements:
   (A)   Field investigation measures, which includes but is not limited to
spill and illegal discharge response, storm drain outfall monitoring,
television (TV) camera inspections and dye testing;
   (B)   Line repairs and rehabilitation;
   (C)   Corrective measures and enforcement procedures.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.03  FIELD INVESTIGATION MEASURES.
   (A)   Field investigation measures.
      (1)   Field investigations will be used to detect illicit connections and
discharges.  Site inspections and spill and illegal discharge response will be
the primary methods used.  The city may also use TV camera inspections to help
detect illicit detections.  Other measures, such as dye testing, will be used
in special circumstances or on an individual case basis.
      (2)   City inspectors inspect all new and remodeled facilities during
construction and upon completion.  In the inspection process, inspectors ensure
that all drains and pipes have been installed correctly and that all sanitary
wastes are plumbed to the sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Spill and illegal discharge response.
      (1)   The city responds to all reports and complaints of spills and
illegal discharges to the storm drain system as soon as possible.  Field
inspections and investigations will be conducted as a result of any of the
following:
         (a)   Complaints received from the general public;
         (b)   Staff observations of suspicious activities;
         (c)   Line blockages, leaks or breaks;
         (d)   Physical indications that a spill or illegal discharge has
occurred.
      (2)   Storm drain inspections are generally conducted after a complaint
or tip is received from a resident, business or city staff.  Occasionally,
storm drain inspections are conducted when city staff is working in the field
and a suspicious discharge is noticed.  Storm drains are checked in order to
detect illegal discharges and track them back to their source.  These
inspections may include visual inspection of storm drain outfalls, drainage
channels, manholes and catch basins for signs of an illicit connection or
discharge.  Signs of an illicit connection may include, but is not limited to:
         (a)   Dry weather flows;
         (b)   Excessive wet weather flows;
         (c)   Odors, oil and grease or other pollutants;
         (d)   Unusual or unexplainable pipes or connections to the city's
storm sewer system.
      (3)   An illicit discharge inspection sheet is completed after each field
investigation.  If a source of an illicit connection or discharge is
identified, the city will require termination of the violation and, possibly,
corrective actions.
   (C)   Storm drain outfall monitoring.  The city periodically inspects creeks
and drainage areas for any types of illicit discharges.  If levels of coli form
bacteria are suspected, the city will contact the Hamilton County Health
Department.  The Health Department will test, and with the assistance of the
city's Stormwater Utility and Building departments, try to determine the source
of the contamination.
   (D)   Television (TV) camera inspection.  TV camera inspection is an
excellent method used to assess the condition of underground pipes and to
detect the presence of illegal connections.  Periodically, portions of the
storm water system are inspected with a TV camera in specific situations, such
as when a road failure has occurred or there is a suspected problem in the
pipes.  In these cases, the underground photos are scrutinized for the presence
of illegal connections to the storm drain system.
   (E)   Dye testing.  Dye testing is a simple and low-cost method to determine
which direction a sanitary or storm sewer line flows.  It may be used to
determine if a drain flows to the storm drain or sanitary sewer.  Typically, a
yellow/red dye (with running water) is added to the drain in question and City
staff monitor the downstream storm drain outlets or manholes for the appearance
of dyed water.  Sanitary sewer manholes are also opened to check for the dyed
flow.  Dye testing is generally conducted on an individual case basis.  Use of
this method is sometimes limited.  If the nearest accessible discharge point is
far from the drain in question, dye testing can require a high volume of water
to carry the dye through the pipes.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.04  LINE REPAIRS AND REHABILITATION.
   Deteriorating or leaking pipes, in the sanitary or storm drain system, may
contribute to the urban runoff pollution in the city's waterways.  Sanitary
sewer and storm drain pipelines are often laid in close proximity to each
other, making them particularly susceptible to infiltration.  Infiltration of
sewage and other pollutants into the storm drain system occur as the
underground pipes age, developing cracks, leaks and breaks.  Pipes may also
have structural failures, which are repaired by the city or metropolitan sewer
district as soon as they are detected.  A break in a sewer lateral or main can
result in a direct discharge to a creek.  If a sanitary sewer line is suspected
of leaking and infiltrating the storm system, the metropolitan sewer district
will be notified of the leak.  If a repair is needed to the storm sewer line,
the repair will be scheduled by the city's stormwater utility department.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.05  CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Violations of the Storm Water Ordinance generally are placed in one of
two categories:
      (1)   Illicit connections to the storm drainage system;
      (2)   Illegal dumping or discharges.
   (B)   If the city determines that a violation has occurred, the city will
contact the responsible party about the violation.  The responsible party or
facility is then required to take appropriate corrective measures to eliminate
any illicit connections or to cease the illegal discharge as soon as possible. 
If the responsible party is a resident or private home, the staff informs them
about the Storm Water Ordinance, explaining why illegal discharges may be
harmful to the environment.  The city prefers to focus on educational efforts
to correct residential pollution problems, rather than issuing written
enforcement actions.
   (C)   There are a wide variety of enforcement actions that may be taken by
the City, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Warning:  A warning specifying the particular violation believed to
have occurred may consist of a verbal notice or a written informational letter
to the property owner.
      (2)   Administrative action - notification of violation and citation:  A
notification of violation is a written notice to the property owner or manager
stating the nature of the violation of the code and a description of the
corrective actions to necessary to restore compliance with this code.  In
general, violation letters state a date by which time the noncompliance must be
corrected and may include a statement warning of additional enforcement
actions, including fines, if the problem is not corrected.
      (3)   Administrative action - emergency termination:  The city may take
steps to prevent or terminate an illegal discharge if the discharge presents an
imminent threat of substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons
or to the environment.  Any person notified of an emergency order under this
action shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering
discharge.  In the event the discharger fails to immediately comply voluntarily
with the emergency order, the city may take steps necessary to prevent or
minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States and/or endangerment to
persons or to the environment.
      (4)   Summary Abatement of Certain Nuisances:  A nuisance, which is a
menace to public health, safety and welfare, may be summarily abated or
restored at the violator's expense.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.06  PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION.
   This program component is where the legal and administrative authority is
established to regulate, respond and enforce illicit discharges in the
community.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.07  CITY PERSONNEL.
   (A)   The city's stormwater utility department is primarily responsible for
implementing the illicit discharge detection and elimination program.  The city
will provide training for each employee who is directly involved in the
program.
   (B)   The Public Works Department is responsible for maintaining the storm
drain system.  The Public Works Department crews spend a majority of their time
in the field and, therefore, are valuable "eyes" for the program.  The crews
may also investigate the cause of an illegal or suspicious discharge.  These
illegal or suspicious discharges are reported to the Stormwater Utility
Department or Fire Department.
(Ord. 19-2005, passed 12-5-05)
§ 53.08  RIGHT OF ENTRY FOR INSPECTION.
   (A)   The city's inspector may request inspection of a facility whenever the
director or any authorized representative of the city wishes to ascertain
whether an industrial or commercial facility or a property owner is complying
with the purposes and requirements of this program or has cause to suspect that
a nuisance exists in any person's property. 
   (B)   If a property owner or occupant refuses or delays entry to the City's
inspector, such refusal or delay shall constitute a misdemeanor: 
   (C)   Persons or occupants of premises from where urban runoff is generated
or discharged shall allow the city's inspector ready access at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection or sampling
and for the performance of any of their duties. 
   (D)   The city shall have the right to set up on the property in question
such equipment as is necessary to conduct sampling or metering of urban runoff
flows. The owner shall not tamper with, alter or damage any equipment used by
the city for the purposes of inspection or monitoring. 
   (E)   Where the discharger has security measures in force that would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the
discharger shall make necessary arrangements with the security guards so that,
upon the presentation of suitable identification, city personnel will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of performing inspection
activities.

      (1)   VEHICLE.  Any single vehicle when not in combination, or any
combination of vehicles, as defined in R.C. § 4501.01.
   (B)   The maximum wheel load of any one wheel of any  vehicle, load, object,
or structure operated or moved upon improved public highways, streets, bridges
or culverts shall not exceed 650 pounds per inch width of pneumatic tire,
measured as prescribed by §
71.60.
   (C)   The weight of vehicle and load imposed upon a road surface that is
part of the interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires shall not exceed
and of the following weight limitations:
      (1)   On any axle, 20,000 pounds;
      (2)   On any tandem axle, 34,000 pounds
      (3)   On any two or more consecutive axles, the maximum weight as
determined by application of the formula provided in division (D) of this
section.
   (D)   For purposes of division (C)(3) of this section, the maximum gross
weight on any two or more consecutive axles shall be determined by application
of the following formula:
         W = 500((LN/N-1) + 12N + 36)
In this formula, W equals the overall gross weight on any group of two or more
consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, 1 equals the distance rounded
whole in feet between the extreme of any group of two or more consecutive
axles, and N equals the number of axles in the group under consideration. 
However, two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000
pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and last axles of
such consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more.

24,000 pounds;
         (b)   Spaced more than four feet apart, and weighed simultaneously,
34,000 pounds, plus 1,000 pounds per foot or fraction thereof, over four feet,
not to exceed 40,000 pounds.
      (3)   On any three successive load-bearing axles designed to equalize the
load between such axles and spaced so that each such axle of the three-axle
group is more than four feet from the next axle in the three-axle group and so
that the spacing between the first axle and the third axle of the three-axle
group is no more than nine feet, and with such load-bearing three-axle group
weighed simultaneously as a unit: 
         (a)   Forty-eight thousand pounds with the total weight of vehicle and
load not exceeding 38,000 pounds plus an additional 900 pounds for each foot of
spacing between the front axle and the rearmost axle of the vehicle:
         (b)   As an alternative to division (E)(3)(a) of this section, 42,500
pounds, if part of a six-axle vehicle combination with at least 20 feet of
spacing between the front axle and rearmost axle, with the total weight of
vehicle and load not exceeding 54,000 pounds plus an additional 600 pounds for
each foot of spacing between the front axle and the rearmost axle of the
vehicle. 
      (4)   The total weight of vehicle and load utilizing any combination of
axles, other than as provided for three-axle groups in this division, shall not
exceed 38,000 pounds plus an additional 900 pounds for each foot of spacing
between the front axle and rearmost axle of the vehicle.
   (F)   Notwithstanding divisions (C)and (E) of this section, the maximum
overall gross weight of vehicle and load imposed upon the road surface shall
not exceed 80,000 pounds.
   (G)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a vehicle is towing
another vehicle, such drawbar or other connection shall be of a length such as
will limit the spacing between nearest axles of the respective vehicles to a
distance not in excess of 12 feet and six inches.
   (H)   As used in division (C) of this section, TANDEM AXLE means two or more
consecutive axles whose centers may be included between parallel transverse
vertical planes spaced more than 40 inches but not more than 96 inches apart,
extending across the full width of the vehicle.
   (I)   This section does not apply to passenger bus type vehicles operated by
a regional transit authority pursuant to R.C. §§ 306.30 through 306.54.
   (J)   Either division (C) or (E) of this section applies to the weight of a
vehicle and its load imposed upon any road surface that is not a part of the
interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires.  As between divisions (C)
and (E) of this section, only the division that yields the highest total gross
vehicle weight limit shall be applied to any such vehicle.  Once that division
is determined, only the limits contained in the subdivisions of that division
shall apply to that vehicle.

load limits shall be  fined not less  than $100.  No penalty prescribed herein
shall be imposed on any vehicle combination if the overload on any axle does
not exceed 100 pounds, and if the immediately preceding or following axle,
excepting the front axle of the vehicle combination, is underloaded by the same
or a greater amount.  For purposes of this division, two axles on one vehicle
less than eight feet apart, shall be considered as one axle.
   (1)   Whoever violates any other provision of this section shall be fined
not more than $25 for a first offense; for a second offense within one year
thereafter, the person shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than $100, or
imprisoned not more than ten days, or both; for a third or subsequent offense
within one year after the first offense, the person shall be fined not less

applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
72.77, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section

§ 72.16  THROUGH HIGHWAYS; STOP STREETS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in R.C.
§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.

15 years of age, and who is not otherwise required by division (A), (B), or (C)
of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of

properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in R.C. § 4513.263.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(C) or (D) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

been or is being committed.
   (F)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (G)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat, or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the

   (H)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat, or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.
   (J)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (J)(1)(b) of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.
         (b)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this section or of a
state law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (J)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by R.C. § 4511.81(I).

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (G)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.

made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
72.01(A) or (B), §
72.80, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI, OVUAC,
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
72.80, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
72.80, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
   (H)   (1)   A suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
72.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
72.80 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

juvenile court, if the court cost was imposed for a violation of an ordinance
of a municipal corporation that is within the jurisdiction of a county-operated
municipal court or a municipal court that is not a county-operated municipal

that is within the jurisdiction of a county court, the court cost that is
subject to this section shall be deposited into the indigent drivers alcohol

   (B)   Whenever a person is found guilty under the laws of this state or any
ordinance of any political subdivision of this state, of operating a motor
vehicle in violation of any such law or ordinance relating to reckless

independent of all other penalties provided by law, may impose a class five

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.

Tax Code, shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on
or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this Tax Code,
and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter. When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of such fiscal year or period.
   (B)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
Municipal return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable
income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (C)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner; or on a
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the municipality's prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (D)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned, received, apportioned or set aside, other income defined
by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession, or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of

the Tax Commissioner may require including a statement that the figures used in
the return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax adjusted
to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this
chapter.
   (E)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return by filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a federal filing
extension with the Tax Commissioner. Any taxpayer not required to file a
federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a municipal
income tax return in writing. The request for extension must be filed on or
before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is granted,
the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day
of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal income
tax return has been extended.

income tax; or
         (d)   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a municipal income tax
return does not extend the last date for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and
interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate
set out by §
91.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed
and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other filing
and payment requirements of the tax code have been met. Any extension by the
Tax Commissioner shall be granted with the understanding that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (F) Payment with returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due. However,
credit shall be allowed for:
         (a)   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of §
91.06; and
         (b)   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of §
91.06, and

result of the tax credit allowed by §
91.15 being reduced by 25% effective January 1, 2013, through December 31,
2013, may be paid in full by April 15, 2014, or in four equal installments on
April 30, 2014, July 31, 2014, October 31, 2014 and January 31, 2015.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or any part thereof, shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1.00
shall be collected or refunded.
   (G)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and to pay any additional tax due, or to claim a
refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations
contained in §§
91.11 and
91.15. Such amended returns shall be on a form acceptable to the Tax
Commissioner. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and

§ 91.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (A)   Withholding by employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the municipality who employs one or more persons on a wage, commission,
or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage, commission or
other compensation is paid, allocated or set aside, the tax as set forth in §
91.03 on the qualifying wages due by the employer to each employee.
      (1)   Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld. Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on
a basis greater than qualifying wages.
      (2)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if
the taxes deducted in the prior calendar year were more than $6,000 or if such
deductions otherwise normally exceed $500 per month. Such payments shall be
received by the Municipality no later than the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar month.
      (3)   All employers not required to make monthly payments of taxes
withheld shall make quarterly payments no later than the last day of the month
following each calendar quarter.
      (4)   Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Commissioner and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefore by the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   Employer considered as trustee. Each employer in collecting the tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality and any such tax
collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to
the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
   (C)   Corporate officers' personal liability. Any person who is required to
withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay all such tax to the Municipality
in accordance with the provision of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the municipality in
accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally and criminally liable for the tax not returned or paid to
the Municipality as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also
liable under the provisions of §
91.10 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (D)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with request to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (F)   Withholding return; list of employees.  Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (G)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the municipality when the services were performed
in the municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (H)   Domestic employees. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic employees employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic employees shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.

§ 91.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (A)   Requirement for filing. Every person who anticipates any taxable
income which is not subject to withholding or who engages in any business,
profession, enterprise, or activity resulting in income subject to the tax
imposed by this chapter, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated
income or the estimated profit or loss from such business activity together
with the estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a person's income is
wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be held and remitted to
this municipality in accordance with §
91.06, such person need not file a declaration.
   (B)   Dates for filing.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of such
calendar year; or within four months after either the start of the taxpayer's
fiscal year or when he first becomes subject to the provisions of this section,
whichever is later.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (C)   Amended declaration.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form acceptable to the Tax
Commissioner; provided, however, credit may be taken in the declaration for the
municipal tax to be withheld from any portion of such income and for income tax
to be paid to another taxing municipality, township or county for which credit
is allowed against the municipal tax,
      (2)   A declaration may be amended at any time.
   (D)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the municipality shall
be accompanied by a payment of at least one-quarter of the estimated tax less
credit for taxes withheld or paid to another municipality, township or county
and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the
seventh, tenth, and thirteenth months after the beginning of the tax year.
However, in the event an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the
remaining payment dates. Failure to file such a declaration or pay at least 25%
of the amount declared on the due dates previously specified, shall subject the
taxpayer to interest and penalties. Assessments shall begin to run on the day
following the due date of such declaration and payments.
   (E)   The taxpayer shall have the option of basing his estimated tax on
either of the following methods:
      (1)   By basing the estimate on the preceding full year's tax liability,
or by annualizing if the preceding tax period was not for a full 12-month
period. In such case, if each installment is paid on that basis, no interest or
penalty shall apply for underestimate, regardless of the final tax liability,
except in the case where the required return and final return payment have not
been submitted within the four-month period after the close of the tax year.
      (2)   By basing the estimate on facts of the preceding three-month
period, annualized for the remainder of the year, and updating this estimate by
amendment as necessary each succeeding three-month period so that at least 25%
of the annual tax liability to be determined shall have been paid by estimate
within one month following the close of each such period so applicable. Failure
to pay 25% of the tax liability by estimate in the manner so described shall
subject the taxpayer to interest and penalties.
   (F)   Annual return required. On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the year following the end of the calendar or fiscal year, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Municipality shall
be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of §
91.05.

   (A)   The City Manager shall, with the concurrence of the City Council,
appoint the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   The Tax Commissioner shall be authorized to adopt such forms as are
necessary to implement this chapter. Such forms shall be designed to be as
uniform and consistent as is reasonable with forms used by other cities in

the City Manager shall approve all forms to ensure that only such information
as is necessary for the proper administration and collection of the tax is
requested.
   (C)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, to
keep an accurate record thereof, and to report all moneys so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of Tax Commissioner to enforce payment of all
income taxes owing the municipality, to keep accurate records for a minimum
period of six years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file
a declaration or make any' return, including a return of taxes withheld and to
show the dates and amount of payments thereof.
   (D)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and has the authority to correct or adjust any
return submitted, when a correction or adjustment is necessary to accomplish
the intent of the chapter, and is hereby empowered to enforce rules and
regulations adopted by resolution of the City Council.
      (1)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to arrange for the
payment of unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on a schedule of installment
payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Commissioner that, due to
certain hardship conditions he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due.
Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
      (2)   In the absence of proof of hardship, all taxes, penalty and
interest thereon accrued, shall be due within ten working days.
      (3)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total
unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand.
   (E)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Commissioner
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the municipality and may
send to the taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any. Such
determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by the taxpayer of actual
records from which his tax may be computed, providing the submission of such
actual records occur within 30 days of the Commissioner's assessment.
   (F)   Upon the demonstration and documentation of good cause, the Tax
Commissioner shall have the power to compromise penalty and interest
liabilities imposed by this chapter, consistent with this chapter and the rules
and regulations. In no case shall the Tax Commissioner possess the authority to
abate or compromise a tax liability.
   (G)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide by regulation
that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted
by the employer from the salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation of
a non-resident employee, and paid by him to the Tax Commissioner, shall be
accepted as the return required of the employee whose sole income subject to
tax under this chapter is such salary, wages, commissions, or other
compensation.

to examine the books, papers, records, and federal, state and local income tax
returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the

§ 91.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (A)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. No additional assessment shall be made after three years from the
time of payment of any tax due hereunder; provided however, there shall be no
period of limitation on an additional assessment in a case of a return that
omits gross income in excess of 25% of that required to be reported or in the
case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in
the case of failure to file a return. In those cases in which the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal
statute of limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be
made by the Tax Commissioner shall be extended one year from the time of the
final determination of the federal tax liability. Should the taxpayer file or
have pending a bankruptcy petition or otherwise invoke any law that would

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except
that if any overpayment is refunded within 90 days after the final filing date
of the annual return or 90 days after the complete return is filed, whichever
is later. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no
amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before
the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the
rate of interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code Section 5703.47.

the right to the possession of the property, except if the person is operating
a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of
the municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle was left is not

the motor vehicle is part of a modified commercial operation; or if the vehicle
is a collector's vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4501.01(F).  Provided, however,
no person shall be prevented from storing or keeping any collector's vehicle on

appeal, in writing and within the time allotted, if the owner alleges that
there is an error in any notice, order, or statement of costs. Such appeal

section govern the construction of this chapter.

Park, who has the final authority for administering the transient occupancy
tax.
   (C)    HOTEL.  Every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised or
held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered
for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the

improvements by the city, there is hereby levied a tax of 3% of all rents
received by a hotel for lodging furnished to transient guests, said tax to be
known as the transient occupancy tax.

which is satisfied only by payment to the operator as trustee for the city, or
to the city. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel
at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest's ceasing to occupy space in the
hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel,

subdivisions;

   (A)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separate from the
rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the occupancy
is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy
or any bill or statement or charge made for said occupancy issued or delivered
by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as
trustee for and on account of the city, and the operator shall be liable for
the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (B)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added any part will be refunded except in the manner hereafter provided.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.05  REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30

      (1)   The name of the operator;
      (2)   The address and business telephone number of the hotel;
      (3)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
      (4)   "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that
the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Finance
for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax
and remitting said tax to the Director of Finance. This certificate does not
constitute a permit."
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (A)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Director of Finance, make a return to
the Director of Finance, on forms obtainable from him/her, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies.
All claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during
the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Director
of Finance. The Director of Finance may establish shorter reporting periods for
any certificate holder if he/she deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he/she may require further information in the return
if such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the Director of
Finance. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Director of Finance and shall not be released by him/her
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Hamilton, or the
City of Forest Park for official use only. The nonavailability or failure to
obtain forms shall not relieve an operator from timely paying such tax.
   (B)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (C)   If any operator required to file quarterly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive quarters within a 12-month period, to file such
returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any operator authorized by
the Director of Finance to file returns at less frequent intervals, fails on
two or more occasions within a 24-month period, to file such returns when due
or to pay the tax due thereon, the Director of Finance may require such
operator to furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of
the operator for a period of one year, as determined by the Director of Finance
from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such operator,
which amount shall in no event be less than $100. Such security may be in the
form of an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent
returns, or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Director of Finance,
conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the returns from the operator.
Such security must be filed within ten days following the operator's receipt of
the notice from the Director of Finance of its requirements. A corporate surety
bond filed under this section shall be returned to the operator if, for a
period of 12 consecutive months following the date the bond was filed, the
operator has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith within the time
prescribed in this chapter.
   (D)   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
city under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make such
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (B)   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to 10% of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the tax and
the 10% penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to 10% of the total
tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall be added for each
successive 30-day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (C)   Fraud. If the Director of Finance determines that the non-payment of
any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25%
of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
   (D)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of 1-1/
2% per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until
paid.
   (E)    Penalties during pendency of hearing or appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in §
99.08 of this chapter nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Director of
Finance provided for in §
99.09 of this chapter.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX, DETERMINATION OF TAX BY DIRECTOR OF
FINANCE.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall proceed
in such manner as he/she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which
to base his/her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director of Finance
shall procure such facts and information as he/she is able to obtain upon which
to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report
and remittance, he/she shall proceed to determine and assess against such
operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case
such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall give a notice of the
amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his/her
last known address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Director of Finance
for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the
Director of Finance shall give not less than five days written notice in the
manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place
fixed in said notice why said amount specified herein should not be fixed for
such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and
offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so
fixed. After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in
the manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalty. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 30
days unless an appeal is taken as provided in §
99.09. Subject to the policies laid down by the Board of Review, the Director
of Finance shall have the power to compromise any assessment of interest and
penalties.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of Finance with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Board of Review
within 30 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The
Board of Review shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his/her last known residence
address. The findings of the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service
of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.10  RECORDS.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve all
records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have
been liable for the collection of, and pay to, the city. If the operator
furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the operator's records shall show the
identity of the transient guest, if the sale was exempted by reason of such
identity, or the nature of the transaction if exempted for any other reason.
   (B)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business
hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance and shall be preserved for a
period of four years, unless the Director of Finance, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.11  REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Director of Finance within three years of the date
of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director of Finance.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected, or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient guest; provided however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in division (A) of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of
Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the
tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto and such refund exceeds $1. 
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.12  ACTION TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the city.

be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to
the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 28-1988, passed 9-19-88)
§ 99.13  VIOLATIONS; MISDEMEANOR.

guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable therefor by a fine of
not more than $750 or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 90 days or
by both such fine and imprisonment for each offense.
   (B)   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as
required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Director
of Finance, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of
a misdemeanor of the second degree, and is punishable therefor by a fine of not
more than $750 or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 90 days or by
both such fine and imprisonment for each offense.
   (C)   Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or
claim who makes a false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or
evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made,
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree and is punishable therefor by a
fine of not more than $750, or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 90
days or by both such fine and imprisonment for each offense.

incorporate the provisions of R.C. Ch. 718.

income at a uniform rate.
      (3)   The tax shall be levied, collected, and paid with respect to the

   (D)   Statement of procedural history; state mandated changes to municipal
income tax.

enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Ch. 718 in order to

income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-19,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends

Chapter 101 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.

bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality
in any month of the receding calendar year exceeded $1,000. The payment under
division (A)(2)(c) of this section shall be made so that theypayment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first 15 days of a month, the third banking
day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
101.09(A).
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and
such amount shall be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such
time as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2, Form 1099-MISC, or its equivalent form with respect
to such employee, and other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (B)   Collection at source; occasional entrant.
      (1)   The following terms as used in this section:
         (a)   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of

this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (f)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
         (g)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's

            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in a municipal corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed
such services in the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed

               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in §
101.05(A).
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in Division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation
in which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as
a small employer as defined in §
101.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §
101.05(A).
      (7)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
      (8)   Notwithstanding division (B)(4) of this section, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an individual performs personal services at a
petroleum refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the
municipal corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and VLT.
      (1)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by § 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct and
withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the tax
imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         (a)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
         (c)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this Division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by §
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video
lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         (a)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         (b)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         (d)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
         (a)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted
and withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;

prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes
paid for purposes of §
101.07. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

§ 101.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (A)   (1)   Determining municipal taxable income for taxpayers who are not
individuals. "Municipal taxable income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual
for the municipality is calculated as follows:
      (2)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise
included in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "pre-
2017 net operating loss carryforward'' equals "municipal taxable income".
         (a)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer.
            1.   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined
in §
101.03(C)(32).
            2.   "Adjusted federal taxable income" is defined in §
101.03(C)(1).
         (b)   "Exempt income" is defined in §
101.03(C)(16).
         (c)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by §
101.06(B).
         (d)   "Pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward" is defined in §
101.03(C)(48).
   (B)   Net profit; income subject to net profit tax; alternative
apportionment. This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in the municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Ch. 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   1.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            2.   As used in the preceding division 1., tangible personal or
real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the
value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental
thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not-required to be withheld under §
101.05(B);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (B)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
101.19(A).
         (c)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
101.19(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (B)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (B)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted,
provided that the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf
of, the employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or
indirectly benefits the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in divisions (B)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, for the
purposes of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:

taxation under §
101.03(C)(16)(l) and (C)(48)(a)4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a

Revenue Code.
         (c)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
         (d)   For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, when a

the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
         (e)   For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2018 when an

there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (c), and
(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
101.03(C)(1), by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for
"federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
101.03(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
101.06(B), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
101.06(B), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
101.06(B), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
101.06(B) by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (D)   Tax credit for businesses that foster new jobs in Ohio. The
municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in
the municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be
measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the municipality derives
from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not
exceeding 15 years. Before the municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a
credit, the municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement
specifying all the conditions of the credit.

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
101.09(A)(7) of this chapter or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;

         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year,

for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual on or before the
15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for
the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (C)(1)
(a) through (d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
101.09(A).
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and

annual return is due on the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
101.09(A) for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 19-2015, passed 11-23-15; Am. Ord. 02-2018, passed 3-19-18)
§ 101.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Credit for tax paid to another municipality.
      (1)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality and who
receives income as defined in §
101.03(C)(21) and has paid income tax to another municipality, township or
county on the same income, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
this chapter of the amount so paid by the taxpayer to such other municipality,
township or county not to exceed 25% of the first 1.5% or point three seven
five of one percent (0.375%) of the tax imposed by this chapter on the income
taxed by the other municipality, township or county.
      (2)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in
such manner as the Tax Administrator may by regulation provide. No such claim
for refund or credit shall be allowed unless made on or before the date of
filing the taxpayer's final return, unless such taxpayer's employer files with
the Tax Administrator a list showing the income tax withheld from the
taxpayer's Income for taxes imposed by the other municipalities, townships or
counties.
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect
to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property attributable to distributions
in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more
taxable years.
         (c)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation
shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate
share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income
tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for person working in joint economic development district or
zone. A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
101.08(A).
   (D)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
101.09(F).
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
101.09(F), the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
101.09(F).
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 101.08(A)
regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
101.05(A)(3) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to
the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer,

         (c)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that

administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   (a)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

Municipal Corporation, Ohio IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
         (c)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-
REIT, Form 1120F, or Form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         (d)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway or a portal provided by municipality. The Department of Taxation shall
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
Department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each individual
income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be completed
and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed
for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G).
The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed
by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made
payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and file
the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
foims, together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            2.   In the case of an individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and a net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
101.09(B) applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in §
101.09(B), the provision in §
101.09(B) prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (d) of
this section.
      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
§
110.05(A)(2)(b) or (c).
         (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
101.05(A) shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   (a)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in §
101.05(B).
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(b) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (B)(2)(c) of this section,
the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b) and (c) or
(B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayers federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(b) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
101.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by §
101.19(A)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (E)
(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
101.09(F). Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this section, the
request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10;
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
101.18.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
90 days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest
shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of
interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be
considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the
tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
101.10(A)(4).
      (5)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in §
101.10.

§ 101.11  AUDIT.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in §
101.03(C)(4), the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer a written
description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer during an
audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a
refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the
Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to
have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.

examination.

provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

Administrator. The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties
and functions necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this
chapter, including without limitation:
      (1)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with §

      (7)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, assessments
and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
101.05(A).
   (B)   Authority of Tax Administrator; compromise of claim and payment over
time.
      (1)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount
payable to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim;
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (C)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (D)   Authority of Tax Administrator; requiring identifying information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
101.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
101.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (D)(1) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §
101.10.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
101.99 for a violation of §
101.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
101.15.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event

involved in the activity or transaction.

§ 101.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by

administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.

Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all

fails to pay any tax as required under R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95 or any portion
of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its payment, interest will be
assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid
amount at the rate per annum prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47 from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under R.C. § 718.90, whichever occurs first.
   (G)   (1)   A credit granted by resolution or ordinance of a municipal
corporation pursuant to R.C. §§ 718.15 or 718.151, will be available to a
taxpayer that has made the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, against the
municipal corporation's tax on income.
      (2)   (a)   Each taxpayer that claims a credit will submit with the
taxpayer's tax return documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
         (b)   Such documentation will be provided in the form prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.

beer or intoxicating liquors,fixtures, or other things, used in connection with
the violation of this section, constituting such nuisance.

need not find that the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time
of the hearing, but on finding that the material allegations of the petition
are true, the court shall order that no beer or intoxicating liquors shall be
manufactured, sold, bartered, possessed, kept, or stored in such room, house,
building, structure, place, boat, or vehicle, or any part thereof.
   (F)   Upon judgment of the court ordering such nuisance to be abated, the
court may order that such room, house, building, structure, place, boat, or
vehicle shall not be occupied or used for one year thereafter; but the court
may permit it to be occupied or used if its owner, lessee, tenant, or occupant
gives a bond with sufficient surety, to be approved by the court making the
order, in the sum of not less than $l,000 nor more than $5,000, payable to the
city, and conditioned that beer or intoxicating liquor will not thereafter be
manufactured, sold, bartered, possessed, kept, stored, transported, or
otherwise disposed of therein in violation of law, and that he will pay all
fines, costs, and damages that may be assessed for any violation.  For closing

court or in vacation a judge thereof, may summarily try and punish the

      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      (1)   CULPABILITY.  Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or
negligence, as defined in § 130.09.
      (2)   INTOXICATION.  Includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.09  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for the element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for the element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for the
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.10  ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory  responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.11  ORGANIZATION; OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined in §
130.10 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.12  REPEAT OFFENDER; DANGEROUS OFFENDER.
   (A)    REPEAT OFFENDER.  A person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he
will commit another offense.  It is prima facie evidence that a person is a
repeat offender if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.01 and §
130.01 and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, he
commits a subsequent offense of violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sex offenses as defined in
R.C. § 2950.01 and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, he commits a subsequent sex offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses as defined in
R.C. § 2913.01 or §
134.01 and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, he
commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses as
defined in R.C. Chapter 2925, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for any such offense, he commits a subsequent felony drug abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, he commits a subsequent
offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offense or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, he commits a subsequent offense.
   (B)    DANGEROUS OFFENDER.  A person who has committed an offense, whose
history, character, and condition reveal a substantial risk that he will be a
danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to
the consequences.
(R.C. § 2935.36(E))  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.13  IMPOSING SENTENCE.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
135.99 of this Code or R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence
upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or
combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offenders character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offenders history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offenders conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under 130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for
prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is
necessary to deter the offender from committing a future crime.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victims right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C.  2929.22)  (Ord. 64-1973, passed 1-7-74)
§ 130.14  DEFAULT OF PAYMENT OF FINE.
   (A)   Any person convicted of violating any ordinances of the city who fails
to pay the fine and costs of court as imposed by the Mayor shall be confined to
a suitable place of imprisonment until such time as he/her has remained in
confinement a sufficient length of time, receiving credit at the rate of $50
per day, to have paid the fine and costs in full, unless such fine and costs
are suspended.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section
hereof, the Mayor, in his discretion and with the consent of the convicted
person, allow the convicted person to perform labor in the service of the city
and within the city limits, with credit being given against such fine and costs
at the rate of $3.75 per hour.
   (C)   No such convicted person so employed under the provisions of division
(B) of this section, hereof, shall be required to work more than eight hours
per day nor does such work need be performed on consecutive days.
(Ord. 51-1961, passed 12-5-61; Am. Ord. 3-1970, passed 1-5-70; Am. Ord. 23-
1982, passed 7-19-82; Am. Ord. 05-1997, passed 3-3-97; Am. Ord. 07-2006, passed
4-3-06)
§ 130.15  ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of the offense, or of conspiracy to commit the
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other offense is an offense
of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In the case of an attempt
to commit an offense other than a violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not
specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the
offense attempted is a felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the
offense attempted is a misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a
violation of any provision of R.C. Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18,
that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony punishable by a fine
of not more than $25,000 or imprisonment for not more than 18 months, or both. 
An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an
offense under this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C.§ 2923.02) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.16  TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.
   The Mayor, in his discretion and with the consent of the Jail Administrator,
may give any person who is sentenced to three days or more, and who performs
labor in lieu of incarceration, the option to substitute a payment of $50 per
day for up to one-third of the sentence, provided the first two-thirds of the
sentence is served with good behavior, and provided the time off does not
reduce any sentence requiring a minimum number of days to less than that
minimum.

2006, passed 4-3-06)
§ 130.17  APPLICATION OF TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Title XIII of this code of ordinances embodies and prescribes
penalties for offenses, against the city, not classifiable in previous titles
and chapters.  The word MISDEMEANORS as used in this title is not exhaustive,
and does not imply that offenses found elsewhere in this code of ordinances are
not also misdemeanors and punishable as such.
   (B)   Each act or omission for which a penalty of fine or imprisonment, or
both, is provided under this title or elsewhere in this code of ordinances is
declared a violation of ordinance and unlawful, and is made a misdemeanor, upon
conviction whereof, the penalty or penalties so provided shall be imposed by
the court.
§ 130.18  ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOME INCARCERATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   The City Manager is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a
contract (attached to Ordinance 34-1990 as Exhibit "A") with the Hamilton
County Probation Department, the Hamilton County Municipal League, the current
provider (CDA Inc.) of the Hamilton County Comprehensive Home Incarceration
Program and any other necessary parties in order to participate in the Hamilton
County Municipal League Comprehensive Home Incarceration Program (HCML-CHIP). 
The agreements shall provide for the opportunity by the Mayor of the city to
sentence individuals convicted of non-violent offenses in the Forest Park
Mayor's Court to periods of incarceration by electronically monitored house
arrest under the following provisions:
      (1)   The defendant/participant will pay all of the participating costs
of the program unless determined to be wholly or partially indigent by the
Mayor.
      (2)   The defendant/participant will wear an electronic radio frequency
transmitter that will signal a receiver attached to his or her telephone, which
will communicate with a central monitoring computer for continuous reporting
capability.
      (3)   The defendant/participant shall be employed or have a source of
income, have a stable place of residence served by a single telephone line and
not have a history of violent behavior or mental or learning disorder and must
reside in this state no further than ten miles from the Hamilton County border.
      (4)   The sentencing mayor will determine the number of days of
electronically monitored house arrest to be served by the defendant, plus the
number of days of actual incarceration plus the number of days of actual
incarceration which will be suspended upon successful completion of the HCML-
CHIP program.  The defendant/participant will sign an agreement whereby he or
she agrees that he or she will not receive credit for the suspended
incarceration days until all of the HCML-CHIP days have been satisfactorily
served.  Upon termination of the HCML-CHIP days for failure of the defendant/
participant to abide by the rules or for other reasons of disqualification of
the individual, then he or she must serve all of the suspended incarceration
days with no credit for HCML-CHIP days.  In determining the sentence, the Mayor
shall not sentence the individual to incarceration days plus HCML-CHIP days
which, when added together, exceed the total number of days of imprisonment
which the person may serve under the ordinances of the city.
      (5)   The agreements shall also provide that the HCML-CHIP program may
identify candidates whose entry into the Hamilton County Justice Center to
serve a term of incarceration for an offense under the ordinances of the city
will be significantly delayed and refer such candidates to the Mayor of the
city for consideration of HCML-CHIP sentencing alternatives.
      (6)   The defendant/participant must agree, before being allowed to
participate in the HCML-CHIP program, to abide by all rules of the program as
enforced by the Hamilton County Probation Department, to report as scheduled
and to pay fees in advance as instructed, and to refrain from drug and alcohol
use as required in conjunction with the Home Incarceration Program.
   (B)   That in conjunction with the HCML-CHIP, the Hamilton County Probation
Department is hereby granted the power to exercise its discretion in granting
reasonable stays of execution upon minor infractions or violations of the HCML-
CHIP regulations. Further, the Hamilton County Probation Department is
authorized to make any necessary arrests of violators of this program and to
issue citations to such violators to the Forest Park Mayor's Court for Court
action to terminate the HCML-CHIP incarceration. Further, the Hamilton County
Probation Department is authorized to execute any capias warrants issued by the
Forest Park Mayor's Court for violators of the HCML-CHIP regulations.
   (C)   There is hereby enacted electronically monitored house arrest as
follows:
      (1)   Any or all of the term of imprisonment authorized under the
ordinances of the city for non-violent offenses may be served by means of
electronically monitored house arrest, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. In
such case, the Mayor shall determine the number of days of actual imprisonment,
the number of days of electronically monitored house arrest, and whether any of
the days of actual imprisonment shall be suspended on the condition of
successful completion of the incarceration by electronically monitored house
arrest. The sum of the days of actual imprisonment plus the days of
electronically monitored house arrest shall not exceed the stated maximum
number of days of imprisonment for that particular offense.
      (2)   No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendant agrees to pay the
cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of the Mayor, such portion of
the cost as he or she can afford to pay) and agrees to abide by all of the
rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest procedure.
The agreement shall provide that no credit for suspended days of actual
incarceration shall be granted unless the defendant successfully completes all
of the days of the electronically monitored house arrest.
      (3)   No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention, or purposely violate any of the requirements of the
detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of escape, a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
(Ord. 34-1990, passed 12-17-90)
§ 130.19  REQUIRING PERSONS CONVICTED AND INCARCERATED TO REIMBURSE THE CITY
FOR THE COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (A)   Pursuant to R.C. §§ 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04,
753.16, 2301.56, 2929.15, and 2947.19, which are incorporated by reference, the
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, the city does hereby
require any person who is convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in the county jail to reimburse the
city for its expenses incurred by reason of the offender's confinement,
including but not limited to, the expenses relating to the provision of food,
clothing, and shelter. Such reimbursement shall include expenses for
preconviction confinement when credit for such confinement is credited against
the term of imprisonment.
   (B)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this section shall be
determined by the court after a hearing held pursuant to R.C. § 2929.15, or any
subsequent amendment thereto. The amount of the reimbursement ordered by the
court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement or $65 for each day
of confinement, whichever is less. The court shall consider all factors that
affect the offender's financial ability to make reimbursement to the city. 
When the Municipal Court or Mayor's Court makes a reimbursement determination
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.15, a judgment entry and order of reimbursement shall
be filed and entered that sets forth the total amount of reimbursement due to
the city and the reimbursement schedules and methods.
   (C)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the court finds to be
indigent.
   (D)   Funds that are reimbursed to the city pursuant to this section shall
be paid into the City of Forest Park General Fund.
   (E)   If an offender does not pay to the city the reimbursement ordered by
the court pursuant to this section, the Solicitor may collect that claim or
institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the city in the Hamilton
County Common Pleas Court to recover from the convict the reimbursement for the
expenses of confinement as determined by the court. If an action is filed, it
shall be brought not later than one year after the person is released from
incarceration. If it is deemed in the best interests of the city, the Solicitor
is authorized to compromise and settle such claim in an amount less than the
total reimbursement due to the city. If an offender does not comply with the
reimbursement determination for expenses of confinement made by the court, then
the convict is deemed to be acting in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, and
obdurately and in any civil action on behalf of the city to recover from the
convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement the Solicitor or
his representative shall request an award of attorney fees as part of the costs
of the proceedings. The award of such attorney fees shall be paid into the City
of Forest Park General Fund.

§ 130.20  DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED OR FORFEITED PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
   (A)   Safekeeping of property in custody.
      (1)   (a)   Any property that has been lost, abandoned, stolen, seized
pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or forfeited and
that is in the custody of the Police Department shall be kept safely by the
Police Department, pending the time it no longer is needed as evidence or for
another lawful purpose, and shall be disposed of pursuant to this section or
R.C. §§ 2981.12 and 2981.13.
         (b)   This section does not apply to the custody and disposal of any

               a.   The manner in which it was disposed, the date of
disposition, detailed financial records concerning any property sold, and the

enable identification of the individual officer who seized any item of
property.
               b.   An itemized list of the specific expenditures made with
amounts that are gained from the sale of the property and that are retained by
the agency, including the specific amount expended on each expenditure, except
that the policy shall not provide for or permit the identification of any
specific expenditure that is made in an ongoing investigation.
            3.   Complies with R.C. § 2981.13 if the Police Department has a
law enforcement trust fund or similar fund created under that section.
         (b)   The records kept under the internal control policy shall be open

under this section or R.C. §§ 2981.12 or 2981.13, shall make a reasonable
effort to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them
of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county and to briefly describe the nature of the property in
custody and inviting persons to view and establish their right to it.
      (4)   As used in this section:
         CITIZENS’ REWARD PROGRAM has the same meaning as in R.C. § 9.92.

shall be sold by the Division of Liquor Control if the Division determines that
it is fit for sale or shall be placed in the custody of the Investigations Unit

law enforcement activities. The Ohio Department of Public Safety, with the
assistance of the Division of Liquor Control, shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 to provide for the distribution to state or local law
enforcement agencies upon their request. If any tax imposed under R.C. Title 43
has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other
money collected under this division (B)(1)(d) shall be paid into the State
Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates’ industrial and entertainment
fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its

      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(B)(1) of this section or division (A)(1)(b) of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it
is not used by the agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction
to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (B)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section
shall be placed in the general revenue fund of the state, or the general fund
of the municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens' reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

(R.C. § 2981.12)

otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.
(R.C. § 2981.13(A))
Statutory reference:
   Forfeiture of property generally, see R.C. Chapter 2981
§ 130.21  SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE and VEHICLE have the same meanings
as in R.C. § 2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this Code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self-defense or defense of another.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99  PENALTY.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §§
130.13 or
135.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) or (C)(6)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. 5147.30, the court
shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered
for participation in the program. During the offenders term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offenders participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C.
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C.
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required to
pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.13 and
135.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offenders community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offenders probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offenders good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offenders compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offenders sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offenders occupation or care
for the offenders family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,

travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned

applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor

         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offenders privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offenders motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle operators
license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
or a violation of R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the
violation, if the offender committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more
children who are not victims of the offense, and if the offender or the victim
of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis of
one or more of those children. This division does not limit the court in
requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any offense or in any
circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the countys
general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the
costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division
(E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
   (I)   No refunds will be made if the amount claimed equals $5 or less. The
foregoing not withstanding, the city manager is granted the discretionary
authority to order a refund, including but not limited to an amount of $5 or
less, where deemed to be reasonable and appropriate.

§ 134.15  VALUATION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A)(1) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, the value of the property or services
involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.  When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.  The value
of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,  pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

§ 134.16  EXCLUSIONS.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether

or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic
abuse in any form to which all of the following apply:

standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

premises on which it conducts bingo sessions, the lessor of the premises shall
provide only the premises to the organization and shall not provide the
organization with bingo game operators, security personnel, concessions or

bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(F). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the

electronic bingo aid.
            4.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be part of an electronic
network other than a network that includes only bingo aids and devices that are

with any device not located on the premises at which the bingo is being
conducted.

      (3)   Nothing in this division (D) of this section prohibits an employee
of a fraternal organization, veteran's organization, or sporting organization
from selling instant bingo tickets or cards to the organization's members or
invited guests, as long as no portion of the employee's compensation is paid
from any receipts of bingo.

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

§ 150.04  DISTRICTS, ZONING MAP, AND BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Districts.  For the purposes of this zoning code, the city is divided
into the following zoning districts as shown on the zoning map of the city. 
This map is a part of Appendix A which is incorporated into and adopted as part
of this chapter of the city code of ordinances.
      R-1      One-family Residence District.
      R-2      One-family Residence District.
      R-3      One-family Residence District.
      PR-3      Planned Multi-family Residence District.
      R-PUD   Residential Planned Unit Development District.
      PO      Planned Office District.
      O      Office District.
      SPA      Special Planning Area.
      PB      Planned Business District.
      HS      Highway Service and Special Commercial District.
      M      Manufacturing District.
      IP      Industrial Park District.
   (B)   Measurement of boundaries.  The district boundary lines on the zoning
map are intended to follow lot lines, the center lines of streets, the center
line of streets projected, or the corporate limit lines, all as they existed at
the time of enactment of this zoning code; but where a district boundary line
does not clearly coincide with lot lines, or where it is not designated by
dimensions referenced to such lines, it shall be determined by using the scale
shown on the zoning map.
      (1)   Exact location of boundaries.  Questions concerning the exact
location of district boundary lines shall be determined by the Planning
Commission as provided in this chapter and in accordance with rules and
regulations which may be adopted by the Commission.
   (C)   Territory not included.  In case any territory subject to the
jurisdiction of this chapter has not been specifically included within any of
the aforesaid districts, or in the event that territory becomes a part of the
area of jurisdiction of this chapter by reason of annexation, consolidation, or
detachment from any municipal corporation, or otherwise, such territory shall
automatically be classified as an R-1 District, until and unless otherwise
rezoned in accordance with the amendment proceedings.  However, any zoning
classification in effect prior to such annexation or other extensions of
jurisdiction shall remain in full force and effect until changed or amended in
accordance with the procedures and requirements prescribed for such change or
amendment by this chapter.
(Ord. 10-1986, passed 5-19-86)
§ 150.05  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION MANUAL
AND STATUS OF USES WITHIN DISTRICT.
   The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual as defined by §
150.03 is adopted by reference and incorporated into this chapter as an
integral part of this chapter just as if it were reproduced herein in its
entirety.
   (A)   Status of uses within districts.  Appendix B of this chapter is
adopted as an integral part of this chapter and said appendix describes the SIC
Manual and provides an outline of the classification system utilized to
identify most uses allowed in the various districts.  All classifications
listed within the SIC Manual are designated as being either a principal
permitted use, special exception, accessory use, or prohibited use.  If a use
is determined by the Zoning Administrator to not be classified by the SIC
Manual or addressed in some other manner by this chapter, the Planning
Commission may interpret the correct placement in the SIC Manual or the
Commission may initiate a code amendment to address the use.
   (B)   Deviation from SIC classification system.  Certain deviations from the
strict application of the SIC classification system are required when applying
the SIC Manual to what is essentially a land use classification system. 
Specifically, for purposes of the zoning code, the function performed at the
site in question is the basis of the classification.  This is not always the
case in the SIC classification system.  An example would be the central
administrative offices and auxiliary establishments as described in Appendix A
of the SIC Manual.

there is significant property damage), the City Manager or his designee may
extend the time period allowed in division (c), not to exceed six additional
months.
      (2)   Structures nonconforming only in dimensional requirements of this

   (A)   Procedures for establishment of a planned district.  Every amendment
or supplement to this chapter incorporating a development plan as an integral
part of the zoning regulations applicable to a specific parcel or tract of real
estate shall be governed by the procedures included in this section in lieu of
the similar procedures set out in §§
150.190 through
150.192.  Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or good
zoning practice require, the City Council may, on its own motion or after
recommendation thereon by the Planning Commission and subject to the procedure
provided in this section, amend, supplement, or change the regulations,
district boundaries, or classifications, of property, now or hereafter
established by this section or amendments thereof.  It shall be the duty of the
Commission to submit to the Council its recommendations regarding all
applications or proposals for amendments or supplements.  An amendment,

planned zoning district shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its
review and shall be accompanied by a development plan as defined by this
chapter, covering all parts of the tracts in question.  Application shall be

real estate department of the County Auditor's office of all abutting
properties, all properties directly across any adjacent street right-of-way and
the name and address of the applicant and the nature of his interest in the
property.  Each application shall be verified by at least one of the owners or
lessees of property within the area proposed to be reclassified, attesting to
the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented with the
applications. Applications for zone changes initiated by the Planning
Commission itself shall be accompanied by its motion pertaining to the proposed
amendment.  An application initiated by the Council shall be accompanied by its
resolution pertaining thereto.
   (C)   Establishing Council public hearing.  The Community Development
Director shall forward the application to the Clerk of Council who shall, upon
receipt of such application, set a Council public hearing on such proposed
amendment or supplement, which date shall be not more than 60 days from the

public right-of-way.  The sign shall be provided by the City Manager and shall
refer to the proposal affecting the property and the time and place of the
public hearing.  The sign shall be installed in such a manner as to withstand
reasonable weather conditions.
   (D)   Commission findings.  It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission
to investigate and ascertain whether the location, size, and other
characteristics of the site, and the proposed plan comply with the following
conditions.

consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter, and that it complies
with all applicable requirements and conditions in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.

recommendation of the Planning Commission or adopt some modification thereof by
a majority vote of all members of Council consistent with the intent and
meaning of this chapter within two regular Council meetings following the
public hearing.  If the development plan is approved, Council shall pass an
ordinance amending this chapter via the incorporation of the approved
development plan as an integral part of this chapter overlaying the existing
zoning on the subject property.
      (1)   Change of zoning map.  After a development plan has been officially
approved as an amendment to this chapter, the zoning map shall also be
corrected to include the exact boundaries of the project in question indicating
both the existing underlying zoning and the overlay zoning in addition to the
identification of the development plan.
      (2)   Restrictions within a planned project area.  During such time as an
approved planned project is in effect, all provisions of this chapter
applicable in the planned project area and the approved development plan as
originally approved and subsequently revised shall also apply to the land and
any structure thereon, provided that during such time all provisions of the
planned project shall prevail and take precedence over any conflicting
provisions applicable in the underlying zoning district wherein the project
lies.
      (3)   Termination of project approval.  Approval of the planned project
area shall remain in effect for a period of three years after the effective
date of the ordinance approving the rezoning.  If construction is not in
progress before termination of this period, approval shall become void and
regulations on the tract in question shall revert back to those set forth in
the district wherein the project lies via the automatic lifting and termination
of the overlay zoning.  Construction in progress shall be defined as the
construction of the primary structure on the site as indicated on the approved
development plan.  Site grading and infrastructure inprovements, such as
utilities, drives and streets shall not be considered construction in progress
as it relates to project termination. An extension of time may be approved by
Council, provided that the request is submitted to the Commission for study and
recommendation to Council prior to the termination date.
      (4)   Reproducible copy of approved plan.  The applicant shall provide
the Community Development Department with a full-sized reproducible copy of
approved development plan prior to the effective date of the ordinance.  The
plan shall have a space provided for the insertion of the approval date and the
expiration date.  Said plan shall be updated by the applicant when adjustments
to the plan are approved under the provisions of division (F) of this section.
   (F)   Adjustments in plan after approval.  After the development plan has
been approved by Council, the following provisions will apply to any changes in
the plan:
      (1)   Minor revisions.  In the course of carrying out this plan,
adjustments, or minor rearrangements of buildings, parking areas, loading
areas, entrances, height, or yards may be requested by the proponents, and
provided the requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and this chapter, such adjustments or rearrangements may be
authorized by the Planning Commission without a public hearing.  The Commission
shall act on the request consistent with the requirements of Appendix F.
      (2)   Substantial revision.  Any application for substantial variation in
the development plan involving a new plan, additional buildings or structures,
or changes in land use shall be treated as an amendment or supplement to this
chapter, and shall be governed by the provisions of this section for
establishment of a planned district.
   (G)   Issuance of building permits.  Except as provided in division (G) (1)
of this section the Administrative Agency shall issue a building permit for the
entire project as described in the application, and shall withhold the
certificate of zoning compliance until completion of the project in its
entirety.
      (1)   Staging of large projects.  In the case of large scale projects
involving only one building on a site containing over five acres, or a project
involving several buildings, the Commission shall have the power to authorize
staging the project upon application by the developer; provided that the first
stage shall include at least 10% of the entire proposed project building
coverage in any event. The Administrative Agency may then issue building
permits and certificates of zoning compliance for individual structures which
do not violate the concept of the approved staging.

furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Administrative Official
certified to the Commission, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Commission or by a court of record on application, or notice to the
Administrative Official from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
   (F)   Variance.  In the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or
steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, the Commission shall have
the power to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of
this chapter whereby such strict application would deprive the owner of the
reasonable use of the land or building involved, but in no other case.  In
granting any variance, the Commission shall prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.  Violation of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, and punishable under §
150.999 of this chapter.  However, no variance in the application of any
provision of this chapter shall be granted by the Commission unless it finds:
      (1)   Special circumstances or conditions.  That there are special
circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings, applying to the
land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or
conditions are peculiar to the land or building and do not apply generally to
land or building in the neighborhood, and that the circumstances or conditions
are such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building.
      (2)   Minimum variance.  That, for reasons fully set forth in the
findings, the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of
the land or building, and that the variance as granted by the Commission is the
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
      (3)   Absence of detriment.  That the granting of the variance will be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter, and will not be
injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining buildings and
those in the vicinity, the Commission, in determining its findings, shall take
into account the number of persons residing or working in the buildings or upon
the land and traffic conditions in the vicinity.
      (4)   Not of a general nature.  That the condition or situation of the
specific piece of property, or the intended use of the property for which the
variance is sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for the
conditions or situation.
      (5)   Actions of applicants.  That the special conditions or
circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant.
      (6)   Adjacent districts.  That no permitted uses of lands, structures,
or buildings in other districts on adjacent lands are used as grounds for
issuances of such a variance.
   (G)   Revocation of variance.  The Commission may revoke an authorized
variance if any condition of the variance is violated.  The Commission shall
notify the holder of the variance by certified mail of its intent to revoke the
variance and of his right to a hearing before the Commission within 30 days of
the mailing of the notice if he so requests.  If the holder requests a hearing,
the Commission shall set a time and place for the hearing and notify the
holder.  At the hearing the holder may appear in person, by his attorney, or by
other representative, or he may present his position in writing.  He may
present evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.  If no
hearing is requested, the Commission may revoke the variance without a
hearing.  The authority to revoke a variance is in addition to any other means
of zoning enforcement provided by this chapter.
   (H)   Special exceptions.  The Commission shall have the power to grant
special exceptions in accordance with the following provisions.
      (1)   Specific uses.  The purpose of a special exception is to grant the
Planning Commission the opportunity to permit only those specific uses which
are listed as special exceptions within a specific zoning district which would
not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout the zoning
district but which may be permitted if the Planning Commission decides that the
application satisfies the following standards:
         (a)   The public's health, safety, morals, welfare, and interest,
including but not exclusively, such factors as safety and traffic conditions,
surrounding housing or property values, and the socio-economic impact on people
working or living in the area surrounding the proposed development;
         (b)   Whether a nuisance caused by or increased by noise, litter, or
lighting conditions will be created, and cannot be controlled;
         (c)   Whether the proposed development and attendant special exception
would protect and preserve the character, attraction, and orderly development
of the affected district;
         (d)   That the proposal not be incompatible with the surrounding area
and be an appropriate use as related thereto so as not to be economically,
aesthetically, or environmentally detrimental or injurious to the surrounding
area, or its workers or residents;
         (e)   Whether adequate public facilities and services, including, but
not exclusively, existing or proposed plans for water, storm sewer, and
sanitary sewer, will be available or can be created to serve the anticipated
needs of the development, and whether the provisions of such public facilities
and services is economically feasible or reasonable to the city and its
citizens;
         (f)   The effect of the proposal on vacant land or other proposed
developments in the area so as not to render the use of such vacant land or the
completion of such proposed developments unavailable or unlikely.
      (2)   Conditional approval.  In considering special exceptions the
Commission shall give consideration to the standards set forth in the
immediately preceding divisions.  The Planning Commission may also impose such
requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction,
maintenance, and operation, including but not exclusively, requirements for
open spaces, screening, landscaping, construction of fences and other barriers,
shielding of lights, erection of safety devices, and locations of vehicular
entrances and exits, in addition to those that may be expressly stipulated in
this chapter for a particular special exception, as the Commission may deem
necessary for the safety and general welfare under the standards set forth
hereinabove.
   (I)   Stormwater Management Code.  The Commission shall hear and rule on
variances and appeals pertaining to
Chapter 51 (Stormwater Management Code) as specifically detailed in that
chapter.
   (J)   Sign Code.  The Commission shall hear and rule on variances and
appeals pertaining to
Chapter 90 (Sign Code).
   (K)   District changes and regulation amendments.  The Commission shall hear
and make recommendations to Council concerning proposed zone changes and
amendments to the zoning code in accordance with the provisions in this chapter
and as summarized in Appendix F.

   INTRODUCTION
THE STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION MANUAL
This Appendix B has been adopted in order to more clearly define the status of
particular uses identified as being either permitted, accessory or prohibited
use or special exceptions in order to increase the efficiency of the
development building process. This Appendix is a categorical listing of
economic functions from the 1972 Edition of the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual together with the 1977 supplement to that publication as
prepared by the Statistical Policy Division, Office of Management and Budget,
Executive Office of the President of the United States, both of which are
available from the:
Superintendent of Documents
U.S. Government Printing Office
Washington, D.C. 20402
(stock No. 041-001-00066-6)

The classification of industries following the Manual's format creates a
pyramid of use descriptions. The broadest category on this pyramid is termed a
DIVISION. There are 11 Divisions (A-K) each of which is made up of a set of
MAJOR GROUPS. These Major Groups also have a sub-set of economic functions
termed GROUPS, each of which are made up of a set of INDUSTRIES. Although not
included in Appendix B, the Industries are further defined in the SIC Manual.
The industries are further divided into ACTIVITIES. The structure of the SIC
Manual is summarized below.

Special attention should be given to DIVISION K NON-CLASSIFIABLE ESTABLISHMENTS
which are those uses not otherwise classified by the SIC Manual. The
establishments of such a use(s) in any zone may be granted by the Planning
Commission. Such determinations shall be made according to the Commission's
interpretation of the nature of the establishment which shall be compared to
other uses of a similar nature in the zone(s) in question. The Commission's
interpretation shall apply to all such buildings, structures, or land in the
district rather than being limited to the specific case in question.
USE CLASSIFICATION
The text of the Zoning Code should be consulted in all cases, for the status of
uses within a particular zoning district. Reference to Appendix B is indicated
within each district where applicable. The tables within Appendix B indicate
the classification of each 4-digit SIC designation within specific zoning
districts as being in one of the four Use Classifications defined below:
   PERMITTED USE is that use which is not restricted from a given district and
requires no special provisions but is subject to the required conditions of
that district and other general conditions for all districts.
   SPECIAL EXCEPTION are those uses which would ordinarily not be appropriate
in a district without special restrictions. These uses may be permitted by the
Planning Commission as provided in the Zoning Code. The control of such uses
within a zone are necessary in order to promote and preserve the health, safety
and general welfare of the public.
   ACCESSORY USES are those uses so indicated in Appendix B. Said uses can be
authorized by the Zoning Administrator if the following conditions are
fulfilled. If all or a portion of the above conditions are relaxed; said uses
may be considered as special exceptions. Accessory uses also include those uses
and structures not indicated in Appendix B but which are accessory and
incidental to any of the foregoing principal permitted uses or special
exceptions located on the same lot (reference definition of ACCESSORY USE  in §
150.03 of the Zoning Code).
      1. Such activities must be in spaces which are an integral part of the
main building.
      2. No exterior display or other advertising media pertaining to the
accessory use is permitted to be visible from the exterior of the building.
      3. No exterior entrance to the accessory use, except those required by
law, shall be permitted.
   PROHIBITED USES are all of those uses so indicated in Appendix B.

A    Forty feet but shall not be less than the height of building when across
street from one-family district.
B   For each foot of building height over 40 feet, the distance between such
building and the side or rear property lines of the project shall be increased
by one foot in addition to the setback required for a three-story building.
C     This area shall be measured in accordance with the provisions of
Development Plan, measurement as defined by §
150.03 except that land devoted to institutional structures and grounds may be
applied to the development.
D   No principal building shall exceed a height equal to the distance between
the front face of the building and the center line of the street on which it
fronts.  Any high rise buildings shall be located within a project in such a
way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining low rise buildings either
within or outside the project and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants
of such low rise buildings.
E   No accessory structure shall exceed two stories or 25 feet in height.
F   The area of any interior parking space contained within an office building
or within a multi-story parking structure shall not be included in the
calculations of floor area or lot coverage requirements, provided that said
building or structure shall comply with all setback requirements.
G   Whenever an O District abuts in the front, in the rear or on the sides of
an R District, any building or structure on any premises in the O District
shall set back from the side or rear lot line dividing the two districts a
distance of two feet for each foot of building or structure height.  In the
case of a front setback, measurement may be taken from the center line of the
street right-of-way.
H   In unusual cases, the Planning Commission may reduce this restriction,
provided a development plan is submitted and approved.
I   Except as modified by §
150.153 for service stations.
J   Except when abutting an R-District where it shall be not less than 50 feet.
K   As defined by §
150.03.
L   The height limitations stipulated above shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Church buildings, architectural features.  Barns, silos or other
farm buildings or structures on farms; to church spires, belfries, cupolas and
domes, monuments, water towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles,
masts and aerials; to parapet walls extending not more than four feet above the
limiting height of the building.
      (2)   Places of public assembly.  Places of public assembly in churches,
schools and other permitted public and semi-public buildings, provided that
these are located on the first floor of such buildings and provided that for
each three feet by which the height of such buildings exceeds its yards shall
be increased in width or depth by an additional foot over the setbacks required
for the highest building otherwise permitted in the district.
      (3)   Water tanks, elevator penthouses, and the like.  Elevator
penthouses, water tanks, provided no linear dimension of any such structure
exceeds 50% of the corresponding street lot line frontage; or to towers and
monuments, fire towers, hose towers, cooling towers, or other structures, where
the manufacturing process requires a greater height.
         (a)   Minimum requirements.  All such structures above the heights
otherwise permitted in the district shall not occupy more than 25% of the area
of the lot and shall be distant not less than 50 feet in all parts from every
lot line.
M      In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected or improved on any lot of record, recorded prior to
October 1, 1976, and having areas or widths less than those currently required
by ordinance for the districts in which the lot exists, may be used for any
currently permitted use within the district provided that the applicable
setback and open space requirements are complied with except for those cases
covered by Notes O and P.
N   In the case of curvilinear street and cul-de-sacs, a reduction of the
otherwise specified frontage along the front property line is permitted
provided such reduction shall not result in the lot width at the building line
or the lot area being less than that required in the district where located.
O   One-family detached dwellings may be erected or improved on any lot in the
R-2 District recorded prior to October 1, 1976, and having areas or widths less
than those currently required for the R-2 District.  However, the side and rear
setbacks may not be reduced below the following minimums:
      (1)   Side setbacks not adjacent to street, 8% of lot width.
      (2)   Side setback adjacent to street, the greater of 20 feet or 30% of
lot width.
      (3)   Rear setback, 30 feet.
P   Double frontage lots.  Buildings on lots having frontage on two
nonintersecting streets need not have a rear setback if an equivalent open
space is provided on the lot in lieu of such required rear setback; applicable
front setbacks must be provided, however, on both streets.
Q   The following features may project into any required front setback, side
setback adjoining a street or rear setback:
      (1)   Bay windows.  Bay windows, balconies, porches (including covered
porches but not including porches enclosed or screened by walls and/or windows
on more than one side) and chimneys, may project a distance not exceeding five
feet, provided that such features do not occupy, in the aggregate, more than
one-third of the length of the building wall on which they are located.
      (2)   Cornices.  Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other architectural
features of this type may project a distance not exceeding three feet.
      (3)   Uncovered stairway.  An uncovered stair and necessary landings may
project a distance not to exceed six feet, provided the stair and landing shall
not extend above the entrance floor of the building, except for a railing not
exceeding three feet in height.
R   The features named in Note O may project into any required side setback not
adjoining a street a distance not to exceed one-fifth of the required least
width of the side setback but not exceeding three feet in any case.
S   The side setback width may be varied where the side wall of a building is
not parallel with the side lot line or is broken or otherwise irregular.  In
such case the average width of the side setback shall not be less than the
otherwise required least width.  However, such side setback shall not be
narrower at any point than one-half the otherwise required least width, or
narrower than four feet whichever is greater.
T   Steep slopes; front setback garages.  In any R-District where the natural
grade of a lot within the required front setback has an average slope, normal
to the front line at every point along the line, of such a degree or percent of
slope that it is not practicable to provide a driveway with a grade of 12% or
less to a private garage conforming to the requirements of this chapter, such
garage may be located within such front setback, but not in any case closer
than 12 feet to the street line.
U   Minimum one side of 15 feet and combined side setbacks 40 feet.
V   2-1/2 stories or 35 feet.
W   l-1/2 stories or 20 feet.

APPENDIX E:  PARK LAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS
   (A)   Purpose.  It is found and determined that parks and recreational
facilities are equally as vital to the public good as streets and sidewalks,
water and sanitary sewer systems, and other required public improvements and
physical facilities.  Therefore, the public health, safety, and welfare require
that at least ten acres of property for each 1,000 persons residing within the
planning jurisdiction, as defined in this section, be devoted to and developed
for park and recreational purposes, and the same has been adopted by the City
Master Plan, and is established as the park land standard for all purposes of
this section.
   (B)   Statement of policy.  With respect to subdivisions and development to
which this chapter applies, all of the area required to meet the ten acres per
1,000 persons park land standard shall be deeded to the city and developed for
park and recreational purposes by or at the expense of the subdividers or
developers of the subdivision or developments in which the persons reside.
   (C)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this Appendix the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)    DEVELOPER.  Any person, corporation, association, partnership, or
other entity that creates or proposes to create a development all or a portion
of which will be located within the planning jurisdiction, as that term is
defined in this section.
      (2)    DEVELOPMENT.  A subdivision of the kind known as a planned
development, planned unit development, or single parcel development.
      (3)    PARKS AND RECREATIONAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS.  The funds
established pursuant to this section.
      (4)    PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.  All types of open space,
parks, athletic fields, playgrounds, and other facilities for recreational uses
of any and all kinds.
      (5)    PLANNING JURISDICTION.  The geographical area over which the
Planning Commission has, or from time to time shall have, jurisdiction for
planning purposes.
      (6)    SUBDIVIDER.  Any person, partnership, association, corporation, or
other entity that creates or proposes to create a subdivision, all or a portion
of which will be located within the planning jurisdiction.
      (7)    SUBDIVISION.  The division or redivision of any parcel of land
shown as a unit or contiguous units on the last preceding tax roll, into two or
more lots, tracts, or parcels, any one of which is less than five acres, and as
further defined according to the subdivision rules and regulations of the city.
      (8)    SUBDIVISION RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
Chapter 151 of this code, as amended by the city providing regulations for land
subdivisions within the city.
   (D)   Provision of parks and recreational facilities.  Every subdivider or
developer who files with the Planning Commission a preliminary plat for land
within the planning jurisdiction within R-1, R-2, or R-3 Districts after the
effective date of this section and who has not theretofore filed any
preliminary map in respect to subdivision or development, shall either dedicate
a portion of the land, pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, or dedicate land
and pay a fee in lieu of land dedication as set forth in this section and pay a
development fee, all as provided in this section, for the purpose of providing
park and recreational facilities to serve future residents of each subdivision
or development.
   (E)   Choice of land or fee.  The City Council, upon receipt of the
recommendations from the Planning Commission and the Park and Recreation
Commission, shall determine whether a subdivider or developer shall dedicate
land, pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, or provide a combination of land
dedication and fee payment.  In making the above referenced determination, the
following procedure shall apply:
      (1)   Filings.  At the time of filing a preliminary plat map pursuant to
subdivision rules and regulations or a development plan for approval, each
subdivider or developer shall, as a part of such filing, indicate whether he
plans to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, to pay a fee in lieu
of dedication, or to meet the requirements of this chapter by a combination of
land dedication and fee payments.  If the subdivider or developer plans to
dedicate land, he shall indicate the area he desires to dedicate on the
preliminary plat map or development plan.
      (2)   City Council determination.  After the Planning Commission and Park
and Recreation Commission have reviewed the preliminary plat maps and
development plans, they shall recommend to Council whether the plans of the
subdivider or developer to dedicate the land, pay a fee in lieu of dedication,
or to provide a combination of land dedication and fee payment are acceptable. 
Insofar as practicable, the recommendations shall be compatible with the city
park and recreation plan.
      (3)   Minimum dedication.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
section, no dedication of land shall be required, and a fee in lieu shall be
paid in the event the amount of dedication required by this section would be
less than one acre, except in the event the land so dedicated could be added to
the adjoining, contiguous land area of an existing park or recreational
facility. This consideration shall not be construed to prohibit the voluntary
dedication of land by subdividers and developers in addition to the
requirements imposed by this section.
      (4)   Criteria.  In making their recommendations and determination, the
Planning Commission, Park and Recreation Commission, and Council shall utilize
the following criteria:
         (a)   Unity.  Dedicated land must form a single parcel of land, except
in the event the City Council determines that two or more parcels would be in
the best public interest.
         (b)   Shape and topography.  The shape of the dedicated parcel of land
must be sufficiently geometric to be usable for recreational activities such as
softball, tennis, football, and other active recreational pursuits.  In
addition, steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses, and floodplains may
constitute a maximum of 40% of the dedicated land, and a minimum of 60% of the
recreational use. In this latter regard, 50% of the dry ground recreational
area shall not exceed 3% grade, and the remaining dry ground recreation area
shall not exceed 5% grade.  This requirement may be waived, in whole or in
part, if Council, upon recommendation determines that the recreational needs of
any subdivision are adequately met by other dedicated parcels or existing
recreational facilities; and that this requirement may be waived, in whole or
in part, if Council, upon receipt of the recommendations from the Planning
Commission and Park and Recreation Commission, determines that, although
certain land areas to be dedicated are not usable for dry ground recreational
use, such areas are of unique natural beauty or environmental or historic
value.
         (c)   Location.  Dedicated land must be generally centrally located in
order to serve the recreation and open space needs of the subdivision or
development for which the dedication was made.  The recreation land in a
subdivision or development must be located so that it is reasonably accessible
from all dwelling units within the subdivision.
         (d)   Access.  Public access and maintenance access to the dedicated
land shall be provided as approved by the Commission.
         (e)   Preservation of natural beauty.  In all instances, natural
features of scenic beauty such as: trees, plant life, brooks and other
watercourses, topography, historic locations, views, and similar conditions
which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated land
shall be considered and preserved in the dedication of open space and parks and
recreation areas.
   (F)   Amount of park land to be provided.  In order to meet the purposes and
policies of this section pertaining to park land, it was assumed that in R-1,
R-2, and R-3 Districts there exists an average of 3.5 persons per lot.  Using
this assumption, policies established herein, the following formula shall be
used to calculate the minimum park land area requirements:
                                 A = L x 1524.62 square feet
      Where:      "A"   =   minimum area (in square feet) of parkland to be
dedicated by the developer or subdivider.
            "L"   =   total number of lots* in subject
                  subdivision.
*In subdivisions or developments where other than single-family dwellings are
permitted, lots which meet the ordinance requirements for more than single-
family dwellings shall be considered as multiple lots depending upon the
maximum number of units allowed on the particular lots by this zoning code.
   (G)   Fee in lieu of dedication.  In the event that Council, upon receipt of
the recommendations from the Planning Commission and the Park and Recreation
Commission, determines that a subdivider or developer must pay a fee in lieu of
land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be determined by the following
formula:
                                 F = A x V
       Where:   "F"   =   Fee in lieu of land dedication
            "A"   =   Land Area (in acres) that would otherwise be required to
be dedicated per division (E) above.
            "V"   =   Fair Market Value* per acre of the
                  subject land.
*Fair Market Value shall be determined per division (I) below.
   (H)   Park development fee.
      (1)   Amount of development fee.  In addition to the dedication of land,
payment of a fee in lieu of dedication, or a combination of dedication and fee
payment, each subdivider and developer shall be required to pay a park
development fee.  The amount of the park development fee shall be equal to one-
third of the total fair market value of land required to be dedicated with
respect to any subdivision or development in accordance with division (F)
above.
      (2)   Determination of fair market value.  Fair market value shall be
determined in accordance with division (I) below.
      (3)   Credit for voluntary dedication.  In the event a subdivider or
developer dedicates land in addition to the land required to be dedicated
pursuant to division (F) above, subject to the approval of the Council, the
subdivider or developer shall receive credit against the amount of the
development fee otherwise required by this division equal to the fair market
value of the additional land to be dedicated.
      (4)   Sidewalks.  Sidewalks along one side cul-de-sac streets may be
waived by the Planning Commission if the developer installs sidewalks within
the park land provided under the requirements of this section in such a manner
as to provide a circulation system which, in the judgment of the Commission
adequately serves the park land and the residences in the area.
   (I)   Determination of fair market value.  For the purposes of this section,
fair market value shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Time for determination.  Fair market value shall be determined as
of the time of filing the final plat map or final development plan with the
Planning Commission.
      (2)   Method of value determination.  Fair market value shall equal the
average value per acre of all land in each subdivision or development in its
raw, undeveloped state, determined by application of one of the following
procedures:
         (a)   By agreement between the subdivider or developer and the City
Council, or
         (b)   In the event the subdivider or developer objects to the above
method of valuation, by a three-member board of appraisers, one of whom shall
be appointed and paid by the City Council, one of whom shall be appointed and
paid by the subdivider or developer, and one of whom shall be selected by the
two appraisers so appointed.  The City Council and developer or subdivider
shall equally share the cost of the third member.  The decision of a majority
of such board shall be final.
   (J)   Credit for private open space.
      (1)   Allowance of credit.  In the event a subdivider or developer
provides developed private open space for park and recreational purposes, and
the space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of
the subdivision or development, and in the event the Council determines that
the private open space adequately fulfills the park and recreation needs of the
proposed subdivision or development, the fair market value of the proposed
subdivision or development, the fair market value and actual cost of the
improvements of such areas shall be credited against the land dedication and
park development fee requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Maximum credit.  Credit shall be allowed up to 100% of the total
required land dedication or fee in lieu requirements, and up to 100% of the
total required park development fee.
      (3)   Standards and limitations.  Notwithstanding division (J)(1) and (2)
above, the credit for private open spaces shall be allowed only if the
following standards are met:
         (a)   Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to
be maintained by the zoning code shall not be included in the computation of
private open space;
         (b)   Private ownership, development, and maintenance of the open
space shall be assured by valid and enforceable undertakings on the part of the
subdivider or developer, or otherwise;
         (c)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreation purposes by recorded covenants that run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the subdivision or development, and which
cannot by their terms be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City
Council;
         (d)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park
and recreational uses, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape,
topography, geology, access, and location of the private open space land; and
         (e)   Facilities proposed for the private open space are reasonably
compatible with those required by the city park and recreation plan.
   (K)   Reduction in minimum lot size and width.  If the developer provides
five acres or more, Council may, after Planning Commission and Park and
Recreation Commission review and recommendation, allow lots within the
preliminary plat to be reduced in area by a maximum of 1500 square feet and by
a maximum of five feet in width, provided the open space is increased by an
area equal to the aggregate lot area reduction within the plat, and that only
those lots contiguous with the subject park land or dedication access parcels
leading to the park land receive such reduction.
   (L)   Treatment of land to be dedicated.  Procedure for the dedication of
land and payment of fees:
      (1)   Land to remain unaltered.  Following the approval of a preliminary
plat map or development plan which designates land for dedication, the existing
vegetation, except growing commercial crops other than growing timber,
topography, features of historic value, stream courses, soil, rock strata, and
other natural features of the dedicated land shall not be altered or their
condition adversely affected in any way without the consent of the Council,
upon recommendation from the Planning Commission and the Park and Recreation
Commission.
      (2)   Deed.  Dedication of land to the city shall be by a general
warranty deed conveying to the city, its successors and assigns, good and
marketable title to the real estate described in the deed, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances.  This deed shall be executed and delivered to the
city for recording prior to the approval of the final plat map of any section
or any portion of the subdivision or development, the boundary of which is
contiguous with the proposed park and recreational facility.  Open space
covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the
city prior to approval of the final plat map or development plan, and shall be
recorded contemporaneously with the final plat map or development plan.  In the
event fees, including the park development fee, are required, 10% of the amount
thereof shall be deposited with the city prior to the approval and recording of
the final plat map or development plan, and the balance shall be due and
payable one year from such date, or at the time the first occupancy permit is
issued with respect to the subdivision or development, whichever may occur
first.  In no event shall any occupancy permit be granted with respect to the
subdivision or development until all fees are deposited with the city.
   (M)   Limitation on use of lands and fees.  Any land and fees received by
the city pursuant to this section shall be used only for the purpose of
providing park and recreational facilities to serve the area in which the
subdivision or development concerned is located. Fees paid pursuant to this
section shall be deposited in a parks and recreation capital improvement fund
to be used for recreational facilities.  No part of such fees shall be used for
the purpose of paying salaries, wages, other general operating expenditures
except when city forces are used to develop the respective park site.  Fees
received may be expended only in connection with the subdivision or development
they are meant to benefit.  Parks and recreational facilities so developed
shall continue to be maintained so long as the subdivision or development they
are meant to benefit remains in use.

recommendation thereon by the Planning Commission and subject to the procedure
provided in this section, amend, supplement, or change the regulations,
district boundaries, or classifications of property, now or hereafter
established by this section or amendments thereof.  It shall be the duty of the
Commission to submit to the Council its recommendations regarding all

facilities will be provided by the city thus eliminating the need for
individual building sites to provide their own on-site detention facilities
unless specifically required by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Chapter 90 Sign Code.  Buildings with exposure on I-275 shall be
allowed to have signs on the same property as the buildings which are
constructed larger and taller than the code allows with the approval of the
Planning Commission without a variance.  Signs for a development shall be
included in the development plan and be designed in such a manner that a
minimum of two design elements are consistent through the entire SPA-
1 District.  Approval of a sign as part of the final development plan
constitutes compliance with the Sign Code.

      (1)   Cul-de-sacs.  Cul-de-sacs may have a length greater than that
allowed by the city's Subdivision Code (adopted by reference in
Chapter 151) but any deviation from those requirements must be specifically
justified to and agreed upon by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Private streets.  Private streets are allowed but shall conform to
the city requirements as contained in the Appendix to the city's Subdivision
Code entitled:  "Standard Construction Drawings Legend".
      (3)   Sidewalks.  Sidewalks on street rights-of-way can be eliminated if
a pedestrian circulation system is provided in accordance with the conceptual
development plan.
      (4)   Standard drawings.  The Appendix to the city's Subdivision Code
entitled:  "Standard Construction Drawings Legend" are a basis of the
requirements for improvements in the SPA-1 District.  However, the City
Engineer can deviate from those specifications when, in his judgment, the
conditions warrant a greater or lesser specification.
      (5)   Street trees.  The Staff Review Committee shall evaluate the street
trees using the Appendix to the City's Subdivision Code entitled:  “Street Tree
Planting in Public Rights-of-Way” as a basis of their review but not being
limited by it.

recommendation thereon by the Planning Commission and subject to the procedure
provided in this section, amend, supplement, or change the regulations,
district boundaries, or classifications of property, now or hereafter
established by this section or amendments thereof. It shall be the duty of the
Planning Commission to submit to the City Council its recommendations regarding
all applications or proposals for amendments or supplements.  An amendment,
supplement, reclassification, or change may be initiated by motion of the City

meeting after the required public hearing, the City Council shall either adopt
or deny the recommendations of the Planning Commission or adopt some
modification thereof by a majority vote of all members of City Council.

compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, generally accepted planning
principals, plus Planning Commission policies and other reviewing agencies. 
The Planning Commission may adopt any existing publications as standards for
use by the SRC.

eliminate any conflicts which were detected in the above review prior to the
date of the worksession at which time the SRC will report to the Planning
Commission the progress to date and any remaining unsolved problems or
concerns.

approved by the Planning Commission, the following provisions will apply to any
changes to that plan:
      (1)   Minor revisions.  In the course of carrying out this final plan,
adjustments or minor rearrangements of buildings, parking areas, loading areas,
entrances, heights of structures, or yards may be requested by the proponents,
and provided the requests conform to the standards established by the
conceptual development plan and this chapter, such adjustments or
rearrangements may be authorized by the Staff Review Committee.  The SRC may on
its recommendation defer approval of a specific minor revision to the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   Substantial variations.  Any application for a substantial
variation from the approved preliminary or final development plan involving a
new plan, additional buildings or structure, changes in land use or density

all building activities.  In so doing, different sets of regulations are
included as indicated in this section.

   All documents must reflect compliance with the various elements of the codes
which regulate the proposed project.  Plan review will be based on the above
schedule and the issuance of a permit indicates compliance as required.
   (E)   Administrative procedures and approvals.  The application for a
building permit cum plans approval certificate shall be processed, coordinated
and expedited in a manner whereby all approvals, including of the various
regulatory agencies, shall be recorded before the permit is issued.  The
Building Department shall approve construction documents in accordance with §
106 of the OBC and RCO as appropriate.  The individual agencies shall review
the documents submitted, enforce their regulations and, upon satisfactory
completion of the review, they shall promptly provide written approval to the
Building Official, who may then issue the proper permit.  This procedure may be
altered at the discretion of the Building Official.  Matters not specifically
covered by the Code shall be determined by the Building Official as provided in
§
152.10.
   Applications and associated documents for building permits shall be
submitted through the Community Development Department, except in the case of
those agencies with their own permit facility.  In such event, the applicant
must convey the proper documentation to the other agencies, as indicated
above.  The applicant shall ensure that all applicable permits are secured
prior to the start of work.
   All work must comply as follows:
      (1)   Codes.  Code provisions shall be reviewed and applied only by the
agency having jurisdiction.  All discrepancies must be fully resolved with the
proper agency before approval for a building permit can be issued except that
the Building Official may issue “foundation only”, or “shell” or other fast
track permits if, in his or her opinion, circumstances warrant.
      (2)   Interpretation.  Interpretation, inspection and enforcement of all
agency code provisions shall be by the agency having jurisdiction.
      (3)   Minimum code standards.  The appropriate building code shall be the
minimum standard applicable and no other provisions shall be in conflict
therewith.
      (4)   Fire Department review.  All plans are forwarded to the Fire
Department for review.  Prior to issuance of a building permit, Fire Department
comments are evaluated with respect to building code requirements.
      (5)   Approval.  Formal approval of the completed project shall be
transmitted to the Building Official by each agency involved.  Such approval
shall be required before the Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the
project.
      (6)   Issuance of permit.  Prior to the issuance of a permit for the
creation or occupancy of any number of dwelling units utilizing HUD financing,
the Forest Park Housing Commission shall determine compliance with §
97.10.
   (F)   Electrical regulation.  In order to further the cause of uniformity of
design and installation in electrical work and equipment, Forest Park joins
with the City of Cincinnati and other cities and villages in Hamilton County in
using identical code provisions for such work and in using the services of the
private company, Inspection Bureau, Inc. for electrical plan review, the
issuance of electrical permits and electrical field inspection.
   (G)   Industrial (modular) units.  Such units shall be licensed and
inspected by the State of Ohio, and no other inspection of the units is
required.  However, those portions of such buildings that are not produced by
industrialized methods must follow normal review, permit and inspection
procedures as prescribed by the Code.  Drawings for the entire complex are
required.  Fees shall be as prescribed by this Code.
      (1)   Classification.  Units classified as manufactured or “mobile homes”
are not regulated by this Code, unless they are so constructed that they no
longer function as a conveyance. In this instance, they must fully comply with
the Building Code and be licensed and inspected by the State of Ohio.
      (2)   Certificate of approval.  Further regulations of the manufactured
or “mobile home” are prescribed in the Board of Health rules and the Zoning
Code (
Chapter 150).
   (H)   Prefabricated assemblies.  This Code shall permit prefabricated forms
of building elements and assembled construction units intended for both
structural and service equipment purposes. There shall be no distinction
between these and conventional on-the- site assembled materials and both must
meet the requirements of this Code.
   A certificate of approval by an approved agency shall be furnished with
every prefabricated assembly, except where all elements of the assembly are
readily accessible for inspection at the site.  Placement of prefabricated
assemblies at the building site shall be inspected by the Building Official to
determine compliance with this Code and a final inspection shall be provided.
   (I)   Legal action and appeals.   Since multiple separate sets of building
regulations are required to control all construction within the jurisdiction of
the city, the following procedures shall be observed:
      (1)   Administrative.  The Administrative section of the Building Code
shall be considered supplementary and complementary to the provisions of OBC
Chapter 1 and RCO Chapter 1, and no conflicts shall exist except in favor of
the OBC and/or RCO. No provision of the Building Code is intended to be in
conflict with the OBC or the RCO.
      (2)   Administrative matters.  Appeals, orders, violations, penalties and
other administrative matters for structures controlled by the Ohio Building
Code shall be handled in accordance with the provisions set forth in Chapter 1
of the OBC and this Code. Appeals of Building Official actions are to the Ohio
Board of Building Appeals.
         (a)   Procedures for one-, two- and three-family dwellings shall be in
accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Residential Code and this Code.
Appeals of Building Official actions are to the Forest Park Board of Building
Appeals.

   The Code shall apply to new buildings and structures for business,
mercantile, factory and industrial, storage, assembly, institutional,
temporary, miscellaneous and residential occupancies and uses, their accessory
structures and to their service parts which are hereafter erected in accordance
with § 101.2 of the OBC or of the RCO as applicable.  The Code shall also apply
to existing buildings and structures in accordance with § 3401 of the OBC or §
113 of the RCO.
   (A)   Change of occupancy.  Changes in the use or occupancy of an existing
building shall not be made except as specified in either OBC Chapter 34 or RCO
§ 113.7 and subparagraphs as appropriate.
     (B)   Installation of equipment.  When the installation of service
equipment (new or replacement), extension, alteration or repair of an elevator,
moving stairway, mechanical equipment, refrigeration, air conditioning or
ventilating apparatus, plumbing, gas piping, electric wiring, heating system or
any other equipment is specifically controlled by the provisions of the Code or
the approved rules, it shall be unlawful to install and/or use such equipment
until an approval has been issued therefor by the Building Official or other
agency having jurisdiction.
   (C)   Other requirements. Construction, work, or installations not within
the scope of the OBC or of the RCO per § 101.2, or otherwise exempt from the
requirement for permit per §
102.10, may nevertheless be regulated, thus requiring a permit, per §
152.04(D).

Chapter 154) or any other law pertaining to the location, use or type of
construction of any structure or other condition to which the Code may apply,

§ 152.10  INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   The provisions and requirements of these regulations shall be
construed to be minimum requirements, and where not in conflict with any
specific provision herein, nothing shall prohibit any person from exceeding
these minimum requirements. The Building Official responsible for the
enforcement of this Code shall have the first administrative authority to
interpret and determine the intent and meaning of the provisions of the Code
for enforcement purposes, and is authorized to issue policies and procedures in
order to maintain consistency with legal actions and opinions, Board of
Building Standards memoranda, code changes, and other exigencies.
   (B)   Technical data and interpretations issued by other sources are
advisory in nature and may be received and considered by but are not binding on
the Building Official.  In addition, any  requirement essential for structural,
fire or sanitary safety of an existing or proposed building or structure, or
essential for the safety of the other occupants thereof, and which is not
specifically addressed by this Code, shall be determined by the Building
Official.

§ 152.11  VALIDITY.
   (A)   Partial invalidity.  In the event any part or provision of the Code is
held to be illegal or void by a court of competent jurisdiction, such ruling
shall not have the effect of making illegal or void other parts or provisions
of the Code.  It shall be presumed in such event that the Code would have been
enacted had such illegal or invalid parts or provisions not been included, and
the remainder of the Code shall continue in full force and effect regardless of
the extent to which such illegal or invalid parts or provisions may be
integrated in the remaining portions of the Code.
   (B)   Decisions involving existing buildings.  The invalidity of any
provisions of the Code as applied to existing buildings and structures shall
not be held to affect the validity of such provision in its application to
buildings and structures hereafter erected or altered.
   (C)   By virtue of law.  If any provisions of these regulations are deemed
to be not applicable to existing buildings or buildings being built until a
fixed period of time after these regulations take effect, then such existing
buildings and those being built shall continue to be regulated by laws in
effect at the time of the passage of this Code, until the earliest possible
time when such projects shall be governed by these regulations.  All projects
completed, under permit and for which permit applications have been filed prior
to the effective date of this Code shall be considered “existing buildings”
under this Code.

§ 152.17  BOARD OF BUILDING APPEALS.

accordance with the provisions of RCO § 110.1 unless City Council shall

   (A)   Disqualification.  No member of the Board shall pass on any questions
involving work on which he or she or his or her employer is or has been engaged
or involved as a contractor, a material dealer, or a superintendent; for which
he or she or his or her employer has prepared plans or specifications; in which
he or she has any personal or financial interest whatsoever; or as to which he
or she or his or her employer acts in a consulting capacity.
   (B)   Compensation.  Members of the Board shall receive no compensation for
the performance of their duties.
   (C)   Procedure.  The Board may adopt its own rules of procedure not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Code or ORC § 3781.19.  All records
and proceedings of the Board shall be open to public inspection.
   (D)   Staff evaluation.  A written evaluation of a variance request or
appeal shall be provided to the Board by the Building Official or his or her
designated alternate in a timely manner as to allow the Board to act on such
items within the time constraints contained in this chapter.
   (E)   Powers and duties.  The powers and duties of the Board shall be as
follows.
      (1)   Hearings.  To conduct all hearings required by this Code for work
not under the original jurisdiction of the State of Ohio Board of Building
Appeals.
      (2)   Ruling of the Building Official.  To reverse or to modify an order
or ruling of the Building Official if the Board finds that order to be contrary
to a fair interpretation of this Code.
      (3)   Variance.  To grant variances from Building Code requirements not
under the jurisdiction of the State of Ohio Board of Building Appeals.
   (F)   Hearings and notifications.  The Board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing of any application or appeal, give notice thereof to the party or
parties known to have an interest in the property and conduct the hearing in
accordance with R.C. Chapter 119. 
   (G)   Action by the Board.  The Board shall rule on the items that are
subjects of required public hearings within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30
days from the date of the hearing.
   (H)   Stay of proceedings.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Administrative Official
certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him
or her, that by reason of facts stated in that certificate, a stay would, in
his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by restraining order issued by a
court of record on application, on notice to the Administrative Official from
whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
   (I)   Application for Building Code revision.  Revisions to the OBC and RCO
shall be in accordance with procedures established by the Ohio Board of
Building Standards.  Any person, group, or business entity may make application
to the Board to amend any other requirements of this Code.  The Board shall
review all such applications and shall forward its recommendations to Council
no later than 30 days after the application is filed with the Board.
Notwithstanding any action of the Board to recommend to the City Council a
revision to the FPBC, or of the City Council to adopt a revision to the FPBC,
such revision is required to be submitted to the OBBS for approval in
accordance with RCO § 101.3 prior to such revision taking affect.
   (J)   Appeal.  Any person adversely affected by an order of the Building
Official, or by a decision of the Building Official not to approve plans, or
not to allow specific materials or methods, or repair or demolition of a
building or structure may appeal said decision within 30 days of the date of
receipt of the written decision of the Building Official.  Such appeal may
proceed on the basis that the code or rules legally adopted thereunder have
been incorrectly interpreted and/or applied by the Building Official in that
particular case, or that there are no code or regulatory provisions covering
the particular matter involved.  A decision of the Building Official shall be
deemed to be in writing if it is noted on the copy of the permit kept at the
site of the work and signed by the appropriate inspector or other authorized
representative of the Building Official.  The Board of Building Appeals shall
rule on all appeals related to one-, two- and three-family buildings, and upon
requirements of this Code, supplemental to the OBC and RCO.  All other appeals
shall be to the Ohio Board of Building Appeals in accordance with R.C. §
3781.19.  Any person adversely affected by a decision of the Board of Building
Appeals may appeal said decision within 30 days after the date of said decision
to the Hamilton County, Ohio, Common Pleas Court.
   (K)   Application for variance. The Board shall have the power to vary or
adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of the Code, not under
the jurisdiction of the State of Ohio Board of Building Appeals, in a specific
case, and which will not be contrary to the public interest where a literal
enforcement of such provisions will result in unnecessary hardship, in
accordance with R.C. § 3781.19. In granting any variance, the Board shall
prescribe any condition that it deems to be necessary or desirable. No variance
in the application of any provision of this code shall be granted by the Board
unless it finds that the granting of the variance is necessary for the
reasonable use of the property or building and that the variance granted by the
Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose, and that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the Code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
   In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate and reasonable
conditions and safeguards in conformity with the Code.  Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the Code and punishable
under §
152.23 thereof.
   (L)   Fees.  Each application for an appeal, for a code revision, or for a
variance shall be accompanied by fees in the amount prescribed in Chapter 156
(Comprehensive Fee Schedule).  Those requests for code revision initiated by
boards, agencies, or officials of the city shall not require the payment of any
fees.
   (M)   Reconsideration.  The Board shall, upon application either of the
applicant or of the Building Official, grant a reconsideration of its decision
in any case where new evidence not previously available is presented which, in
the opinion of the chairman, would justify such reconsideration. Any
reconsideration shall not serve to stay execution of the previous decision of
the Board except by special action of the Board so directing.  Reconsideration
shall not require an additional public hearing unless the Board so directs, in
which event the provisions for public hearings herein shall be applicable.

§ 152.18  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (A)   Permit/approval.  The OBC and RCO do not refer to permits, but rather
to plans approval or approval of applications; this code employs the term
“permit” to signify the documentation (as a “certificate of plans approval”) of
such approvals by the Building Official to accommodate the long-standing usage
of the term in prior city Building Codes as well as in other existing city
codes.  The use of the term “permit” in this code shall be taken to mean
“permit cum plans approval” where plans are required, and “permit cum approval”
where plans are not required, or “certificate of plans approval” as
appropriate.
   (B)   Separate permits required.  A separate permit shall be required for
the following construction components which will not be included in the
building permit:
      (1)   Electric installation or alterations. (Application by subcontractor
to Inspection Bureau, Inc. (IBI));
      (2)   Plumbing installation or alterations. (Application by subcontractor
to Hamilton County Health Department (HCHD));
      (3)   Sprinkler system or sprinkler system component installation,
alteration or repair;
      (4)   Fire alarm system or alarm system component installation,
alteration or repair, including supervision;
      (5)   Underground fire lines;
      (6)   Elevators;
      (7)   HVAC and mechanical equipment installation, alteration, or repair;
      (8)   Demolition;
      (9)   Exterior site work regulated by
Chapter 154 of FPCO;
      (10)   Swimming pools;
      (11)   Sheds and other accessory structures; and
      (12)   Signs.
   (C)   When a permit is required.  It shall be unlawful to construct, alter,
remove or demolish any building or change the occupancy thereof from one use or
group to another, or to install or alter any equipment for which provision is
made or the installation of which is regulated by the Code, without first
filing an application with the Building Official in writing and obtaining the
required permit therefor.
   (D)   Form of application.  Application for a permit shall be submitted in
such form as the Building Official may prescribe.
   (E)   By whom application is made.  Application for a permit shall be made
by the owner or lessee of the property concerned, or agent of either, or by the
licensed engineer or architect, or the contractor employed in connection with
the proposed work.  The full names and addresses of the owner, any lessee, and
any applicant, if other than owner or lessee, and of the responsible officers
of owner and lessee, if a corporate body or incorporated association, shall be
stated in the application.  All applicants for permits shall represent the
owner and be duly qualified under applicable laws.
   (F)   Construction documents.  Requirements for submittal of construction
documents shall be in accordance with § 106 of the OBC or RCO as appropriate.
   (G)   Revisions.  If during the execution of the work or prior thereto, it
is desired to deviate, in any manner affecting the construction or other
essential or vital feature of the work, from the terms of the approved
application, drawings, specifications or statement, notice of such intention to
alter or deviate shall be given, in writing, to the Building Official and his
or her written consent shall be obtained before such alteration or deviation
may be made.  If such change or deviation affects the bearing or structural
parts of such work or its class of occupancy, new plans and specifications
therefor, shall be submitted for approval.  Notices of alterations and
approvals therefore shall be accompanied by a new application for permit with
payment of fees per
Chapter 156 of the FPCO.
      (1)   Unapproved revisions or the use of unapproved material in the work
shall be treated as a violation of the Code as per §
152.23 and shall be remedied as provided in §§
152.23(D) and (E).  All work affected by the revisions or materials shall stop
(as per § 152.24) until such time as proper documentation of the change is
presented and approved.  Any work in place shall be modified, changed or
removed as necessary to achieve full compliance with the provisions of the
Code.
(Ord. 27-2012, passed 12-17-12; Am. Ord. 04-2018, passed 4-15-18)
§ 152.19  WORK WITHOUT PERMITS.
   Except as provided below, any person, firm or corporation who performs work
for which a permit is required by the Code without having first secured a
permit therefor, shall be deemed in violation of the Code and subject to the
penalties provided by the Code.  Filing of an application for a permit does not
constitute approval of plans or permission to work.
   (A)   Emergencies. 
      (1)   In case of emergency where there is actual and immediate risk of
failure of collapse of a structure, or the existence of defective equipment or
service facilities such as to endanger life or health, or such other condition
as to require immediate action to make repairs necessary to prevent the
occurrence of such dangers, and time available is not sufficient to allow the
securing of a permit, as required by the Code, the person, firm or corporation
required to perform such repairs may proceed to do so after having first
attempted to notify the Building Official of such fact.  In case the Building
Official is unavailable, notice shall be given on the next business day.  Even
in such emergencies, the required permit shall be obtained without unreasonable
delay after installation starts, and in no case more than three working days,
or an additional fee as provided below shall be charged for the permit.
      (2)   Before issuing such permit, the Building Official shall take
necessary steps to determine whether work performed prior to the date of permit
and inspection conforms to the Code.  Such steps may include, but shall not be
limited to, directing the tearing out of sections of surface work for access to
subsurface sections, digging for access to foundation, pipeline and other
subterranean work and the like.  The applicant for the permit shall perform all
such work as may be directed at his or her own expense.
   (B)   Failure to obtain permits before starting work.  Any person, firm or
corporation who shall commence any installation or work for which a permit is
required by the Code, without first having obtained a permit therefore, shall,
if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a permit, pay
additional fees prescribed in
Chapter 156 (Comprehensive Fee Schedule). This requirement shall not apply to
emergency work or installation as provided above, when it shall be proved to
the satisfaction of the Building Official that a safety hazard existed and that
such work or installation was urgently necessary, and that it would have been
impractical to take the time for application and issuance of the permit.
(Ord. 27-2012, passed 12-17-12; Am. Ord. 04-2018, passed 4-15-18)
§ 152.20  PERMITS.

152.18(A) above.
   (B)   Action on application.  The Building Official shall examine or cause
to be examined all applications for permits and amendments thereto within a
reasonable time after filing, and in accordance with the requirements of the
OBC or RCO as applicable.
   (C)   Permit validation.  The Building Official shall attach his or her
signature or stamp to every permit (Certificate of Plans Approval), or he or
she may authorize an appropriately certified backup Building Department
employee or third party contractor to affix such stamp thereto to validate the
permit.
   (D)   Posting of permit.  A true copy of the building permit or such other
instrument serving the purpose as the Building Official may authorize or
approve shall be posted on the site of operations open to public inspection
during the entire time of prosecution of the work and until the completion of
same.
(Ord. 27-2012, passed 12-17-12; Am. Ord. 04-2018, passed 4-15-18)
§ 152.21  CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Payment of fees.  No permit shall be issued and no amendment to a
drawing, application for permit, or other submission shall be approved or
certified until fees prescribed in Chapter 156 (Comprehensive Fee Schedule)
have been paid.
   (B)   Compliance with Code.  A permit shall be an authorization to proceed
with the work, but shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel,
alter or set aside any of the provisions of the Code, zoning laws or other
applicable laws, except as specifically allowed by lawfully granted
modification or deviation.  Permit issuance shall not prevent the Building
Official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in
construction or of violations of this Code except as otherwise prohibited by
the OBC or RCO.
   (C)   Compliance with approved documents.  All work shall accurately conform
to the approved application, plans, and drawings for which the permit has been
issued and any approved amendments thereto.
   (D)   Change in plot.  No lot or plot shall be changed, increased or
diminished in area from that shown in the application for permit without first
amending the application to that effect, except where the change is caused by
reason of an official street opening, street widening or other public
improvement.
   (E)   Lot lines.  It shall be illegal to sell, lease or provide an easement
over any land at any time, if by virtue of such sale, lease or easement any
clearance, yard or court space prescribed by the code or the zoning or other
applicable law for Fire Department access or for other legal purposes is
reduced to such an extent as to constitute a violation of the Code or such
other laws.
   (F)   Lot line markers required.  Before any work is started in the
construction of a building, all lot lines shall be clearly marked at their
intersections with permanent markers, and the building perimeters shall be
marked with markers which are offset at an established distance.

§ 152.22  INSPECTION.
   (A)   General.  Before issuing a permit for the construction, enlargement,
alteration, repair, removal, demolition or change of use of any building,
structure or site, the Building Official may examine or cause to be examined
any or all such buildings, structures and sites in connection with which an
application has been filed for such permit.
      (1)   Duty to inspect.  The Building Official shall conduct or cause to
be conducted such inspections from time to time during and upon completion of
the work for which he or she issued such permits in accordance with the OBC or
RCO, and as he or she may deem necessary to determine that the work is in
accordance with the requirements of the Code and the approved drawings and
specifications.  The Building Official shall maintain a record of all such
examinations, inspections and of all violations of the Code.
      (2)   No duty to inspect.  The Building Official has no duty to inspect
work exempted from permit requirements under §
152.18(C), nor any other work for which no permit has been issued.

persons, firms, or corporations who are under contract to perform such
services, and are specifically certified by the Ohio Board of Building
Standards to make such inspection. The Building Official is also authorized to
accept reports of special inspection in accordance with OBC § 1704.
   (C)   Mandatory inspections.  In addition to those mandatory inspections
required per the OBC or RCO, the Building Official may require other
inspections to be performed at specific intervals during construction; these
are denoted as “called for” inspections in Table No. 22. These inspections
require notification from the permit holder when the work is ready for such
inspection. No work shall be performed to change or cover uninspected work.
Access by the inspector to the work to be inspected must be provided by the
contractor or by the building owner.
   (D)   Special inspection.  The Building Official shall require special
inspections of work regulated by the OBC in accordance with Chapter 17 of that
code.  Those inspections are as called for in a Statement of Special
Inspections for the project.
   (E)   Notice.  It shall be mandatory that the holder of a permit notify the
proper inspection agency when work is ready for the various “called for”
inspections required by the terms of the permit and regulations.  (See Table
No. 22).  Such notice shall be given within a reasonable time before the
inspection is desired, but in no event less than 24 hours in advance.  Notice
given on Friday or on a day prior to a legal holiday shall not constitute
notice for inspection on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, unless arrangements
have been made for inspection on such days.  Before giving such notice, the
holder of the permit shall first test the work and satisfy himself or herself
that it conforms to the approved plans and specifications and the requirements
of the Code. Schedule and timing of inspections in special conditions shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Building Official and the owner.
   (F)   Action on notice.  Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for
inspection, the agency shall inspect the work as soon as reasonably
practicable.  However, failure of the agency to make a prompt inspection shall
not be deemed justification for covering work without inspection when such work
is required to be inspected before being covered.
   (G)   Covering work.  Subject to the requirements of § 108.1 of the OBC or
RCO, it shall be a violation of the Code to cover any work prior to the
inspections required under the provisions of a permit or the approved rules, or
the Code, unless a requested inspection has not been made within four days of
the request. The Building Official shall require the holder of the permit to
uncover any such work for inspection and the cost of uncovering such work and
of replacing the cover after the work has been found or made satisfactory shall
be borne by the holder of the permit.
   (H)   Plant inspection.  The Building Official may require special
inspection at the point of the manufacture or fabrication of all materials and
assemblies which the Code requires to be inspected at such points, or shall
require evidence of conformance by an industry trade association certification
or fabricator inspection agency approved by the Ohio Board of Building
Standards in accordance with OBC §§ 114.3 and 1704.2.2.
   (I)   Right of entry.  Whenever necessary to make an inspection under this
Code, or to enforce any of the provisions of this Code, or whenever the
Building Official or his or her authorized representative has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any building or upon the premises dangerous,
unsafe or substandard (as defined in this Code) conditions, and the Building
Official or his or her authorized representative may enter such building or
premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty
imposed upon the Building Official under this Code in accordance with the OBC
or RCO as appropriate.
   (J)   Final inspection and certificate.  It shall be the duty of the
Building Official to make or cause to be made a final inspection and
examination of all buildings or structures included under the various
classifications of the Code, hereafter erected, constructed, altered, repaired
or added to, before any such building or structure is occupied, and if such a
building has been found to have been constructed in conformity to the
provisions of the code, to issue a written certificate thereof to the owner as
set forth below.
      (1)   A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained by the applicant for
new buildings, additions, and change of occupancy in accordance with § 111 of
the OBC or RCO.  It shall be unlawful to occupy or use a building or addition
prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
      (2)   A certificate of completion shall be obtained by the applicant for
alterations and repairs of existing buildings in accordance with § 111.1.2 of
the OBC or RCO.
      (3)   Temporary occupancy.  Upon the request of the holder of a permit,
the Building Official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy or
temporary certificate of completion for a building or structure, or part
thereof, before the entire work covered by the permit shall have been completed
in accordance with § 111 of the OBC or RCO as applicable.
      (4)   The term of a temporary certificate of occupancy or completion
shall be at the discretion of the Building Official; but, in no case shall the
term of the first issuance or extension of a temporary certificate be longer
than 30 days.  An additional fee in accordance with Chapter 156 of the FPCO
shall be paid by the owner or owner representative for the first temporary
certificate of occupancy or completion, and the fee shall be thereafter doubled
for each extension of a temporary certificate.
      (5)   The applicant will be subject to penalties provided in the Forest
Park Building Code if he or she allows the building or portion of thereof to be
occupied before final inspection has been made and a certificate of occupancy
has been issued.
      (6)   The fees for certificate of occupancy, certificate of completion,
temporary or partial certificate of completion, shall be as indicated in the
Comprehensive Fee Schedule,
Chapter 156 of the FPCO.

§ 152.23  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   The owner of a building or other structure or premises in or on which
buildings, structures, service equipment are installed, altered, replaced,
repaired or maintained shall have the final responsibility for every violation
of any provisions of this Code. However, any person, firm or corporation which
performs work for which a permit is required by the Code without first having
secured a permit therefor; and every person, firm or corporation who shall
violate or assist in the violation of any provisions of the Code shall also be
responsible and liable for such violation and subject to the penalty provided
by the Code. Any person who misrepresents a material fact in securing a permit
under the provisions of the Code shall be in violation thereof and subject to
the penalties provided.
   (A)   Notice. The Building Official shall serve written notice of violation
of the provisions of the Code, of violation of construction documentation
approved thereunder, or of violation of a permit or certificate issued under
the Code, or of unsafe building, of condemnation, of stop work orders, or of
any other order of the Building Official, on the person(s) responsible for such
violation or for its remedy in accordance with § 109 of the OBC or the RCO as
appropriate.  The Building Official shall order the discontinuance of illegal
action or condition, the abatement or correction of any such violation or the
taking of such action as may be necessary to achieve compliance with the Code,
and he or she shall serve written notice of such order on such responsible
person(s), and shall post such notices or orders as appropriate.
   (B)   Prosecution of violation. If such violation is not corrected or such
order is not complied with in the time noted on the notice, and there is no
appeal of the order, the Building Official shall request legal counsel of the
City to institute appropriate proceedings at law or in equity to restrain,
correct, abate or punish such violation of the Code or of such order.
   (C)   Violation; penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of
the Code or fail to comply with any of its requirements or who shall erect,
construct, alter or repair, or do any work upon or in connection with any
buildings or structures in violation of a plan therefor or a directive relating
thereto made by the Building Official, or of a permit or certificate issued
under the Code, is subject to a fine in accordance with § 109.3 of the OBC or
the RCO, as appropriate.  Each day that any such violation or failure continues
shall be deemed a separate offense.
      (1)   Any person who violates any provision of the code or fail to comply
with any of its requirements, or who shall erect, construct, alter or repair,
or do any work upon or in connection with any buildings or structures in
violation of a plan therefor or a directive relating thereto made by the
Building Official, or of a permit or certificate issued under the code, shall,
in addition to any civil or administrative remedies, be subject to criminal
prosecution of such conduct or omission.
      (2)   If the offending person or entity receives a notice pursuant to
this chapter for corrective action, or to stop all work pending corrective
action, and said person or entity fails to obey said notice, that person shall
be charged with a violation, and such charge shall be considered a minor
misdemeanor subject to a fine not to exceed $150. If two or more notices are
given for the same unlawful conduct or failure to comply, said violation shall
constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor subject to punishment of up to a maximum
of $500 fine and 30 days incarceration. Each and every subsequent violation
will be considered a separate fourth degree misdemeanor offense subject to
separate charges and punishment.
   (D)   Abatement.  Further, as provided in R.C. § 715.30, in the event any
building is being erected, constructed, altered, repaired or maintained in
violation of these regulations, the Attorney for the city, the Building
Official, or any adjacent, contiguous or neighboring property owner who would
be especially damaged by such violation, in addition to the remedies provided
by law, may institute a suit for injunction, abatement or other appropriate
action to prevent such violation of these regulations relating to the erection,
construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of such building.
   (E)   Legal action. The imposition of any fine shall not preclude the
Building Official from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a
court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use; or to
restrain, correct, or abate a violation or to prevent an illegal act, conduct
an illegal business or use in or about any premises or to require compliance
with provisions of the Code or applicable laws, ordinances, rules, resolutions
or the orders or determinations of the Building Official or the Board of
Appeals provided that the Building Official has first complied with the
procedures established under R.C. § 3781.031.
   (F)   Removal of posted orders.  The unauthorized removal of posted orders
from a building or structure, which orders have been affixed to the building,
by any person(s) not so authorized by the Building Official shall be deemed to
be obstruction of official business in accordance with FPCO §
132.23, and be subject to a fine not to exceed $500, or imprisonment not to
exceed six months, or both (by authority of R.C. § 715.67).

§ 152.24  STOP WORK ORDERS.
   (A)   Notice. Whenever it shall come to the attention of the Building
Official that work of any kind is being prosecuted contrary to the provisions
of the Code or in an unsafe or dangerous manner, he or she shall promptly issue
a stop work order in accordance with § 109 of the OBC and RCO, and shall post
at the site of the work a distinctive placard conforming to the approved rules
informing the public and all concerned that work at the site has been stopped
by official order.
   (B)   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall violate any such order or
continue such prohibited work after such order has been issued shall be liable
to the penalties prescribed in §
152.23 and the Building Official may proceed as provided in that section.
(Ord. 27-2012, passed 12-17-12; Am. Ord. 04-2018, passed 4-15-18)
§ 152.25  UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Examination and record of unsafe, unsanitary and damaged buildings.
The Building Official shall examine every building or structure reported or
observed as damaged, dangerous, structurally unsafe, or constituting a health
or fire hazard as defined in §
152.30 of this code; and he or she shall cause a report of such examination to
be prepared and filed in a docket of unsafe or damaged structures and premises,
stating the use of the building or structure and the nature and estimated
amount of any such damage.
   (B)   Uncovering defects.  Whenever it is established by inspection that a
definite and serious hazard to safety or health may exist, the Building
Official shall have the right to require the removal or may remove lath,
plaster, boarding, earth or other cover or obstruction concealing unsuspected
unsafe conditions to permit adequate inspection thereof, but the extent of such
removal shall be that reasonably necessary for such inspection.
   (C)   Right of condemnation.
      (1)   When a building or structure is or hereafter shall become unsafe, 
substandard, unsanitary or deficient in adequate exit facilities, or which is
or shall constitute a fire hazard, or is or shall become, in any way, dangerous
to human life or public welfare, or which, by reason of illegal or improper
use, occupancy or maintenance, is or shall become unsafe, it may be ordered
demolished by the Building Official in accordance with § 109.4.1 of the OBC or
the RCO as appropriate.  Such order shall be issued only after proper
inspection and evaluation by the Building Official. The results of such
evaluation and the professional opinion of the Building Official shall be the
factors which determine the terms of the order. Demolition work shall comply
with FPCO § 154.8.
      (2)   In the alternative, the Building Official may permit the owner to
make proper repairs to the building or structure. Such repairs shall render the
building or structure safe and standard as deemed necessary by the Building
Official and as provided in this section or any other applicable laws,
ordinances or resolutions. The Building Official shall, when issuing the Unsafe
Building Order, allow the owner the choice of demolition or repair of the
property.  When the option to rehabilitate a building or structure is accepted,
the owner of the building or structure shall, within 30 days, make application
for a permit to repair, or, if plans are required to obtain a permit, provide
to the Building Official a letter of intent to obtain a permit prior to a date
specified and approved by the Building Official. If the permit is not obtained
within the time specified, or if the work is not pursued in accordance with the
terms of the permit, as authorized by this code, the Building Official may
order the building or structure demolished without option of repair.
      (3)   A vacant building which is open at door, window or other openings,
shall conclusively be deemed a fire hazard, unsafe, and abandoned, as described
in FPCO §
153.05, unless it is permanently closed and protected in an approved manner. 
Notwithstanding that a vacant building may be permanently closed and protected;
the Building Official may nevertheless order demolition in accordance with this
section and § 109.4.1 of the OBC or the RCO, as appropriate.
   (D)   Unsafe building orders.
      (1)   If an unsafe, substandard or unsanitary condition is found in a
building or structure, the Building Official shall serve on the owner, or
owners of record, agent or person in control of the building or structure a
written order, hereinafter referred to as an “Unsafe Building Order”. Such
order shall designate the building or structure, describing the repairs or
improvements required to render the building or structure or its equipment or
service facilities safe, secure and/or sanitary, ordering that such repairs or
improvements be made or that the building or structure or equipment or service
facilities or unsafe portion thereof be demolished, within a period also
stipulated in the order not less than 30 days after by the date of the Unsafe
Building Order.
      (2)   Service of the written “Unsafe Building Order” shall be by
certified mail return receipt requested directed to the last known address of
the owner, agent or person in control of such unsafe building in accordance
with § 109 of the OBC or RCO.
   (E)   Posting unsafe building orders.  If neither the owner, agent or person
in control of such unsafe building or structure can be found within the city
after reasonable diligent search, the unsafe building order shall be sent to
one of them by registered or certified mail directed to his or her last known
address, and a copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place on such
building or structure; and each procedure shall be deemed the equivalent of
personal notice or service.
   (F)   Required response to order. The person upon whom the unsafe building
order is served is required to give notice, in writing, to the Building
Official within ten days of receipt of such order, stating whether he/she
intends to comply with the unsafe building order. If the order is in the
alternative, as to repair or demolition, he or she shall indicate what action
he/she intends to take.
   (G)   Appeals. 
      (1)   The owner of any building or structure against which an unsafe
building order has been issued and served under this section, shall have the
right to appeal such order as provided under §
152.17(J) and R.C. § 3781.031.
      (2)   Such appeal shall be presented in writing within 30 days after
service of such unsafe building order, but shall not operate to stay any
emergency action or the performance of any emergency work on such building or
structure which the Building Official deems immediately necessary as provided
under §
152.26; nor shall such appeal be heard unless it alleges such order to be
unnecessary, improper or unreasonable, and contains a statement of the specific
reasons which the appellant contends support such allegation(s).
   (H)   Disregard of unsafe building order. Upon refusal of the person on whom
an unsafe building order is served to comply therewith, or upon his or her
failure or neglect to reply thereto stating his or her intention with regard
thereto, or upon his or her use of the unsafe building or structure, equipment
or service facilities in violation of the unsafe building order issued under
this section, the proper legal official shall be advised and may institute such
action in the courts as may be appropriate to compel compliance or to recover
the costs of demolition by the city.
   (I)   Discontinuance of service. 
      (1)   The Building Official shall furnish a copy of all unsafe building
orders to the public utilities serving that building or structure, which
services may be affected by the condition responsible for said order, and shall
make thereon a request that service being furnished the building or structure
by said utility be discontinued when, in his or her opinion, the continuance of
said service will constitute a hazard to the public.
      (2)   Upon receipt of said copy of notice and the request thereof, the
supplier of such service is authorized to discontinue its supply at the meter
in the designated portion of the building or structure. Such utility service
may be reconnected upon certification by the Building Official that an
inspection has been brought into substantial compliance with the requirements
of the Code.
   (J)   No liability upon public utilities or public authorities.  No
liability shall be imposed upon any public service authority for failure to
render service or for disconnecting service to any building where disconnection
is based on the non-issuance of a permit and/or certificate of approval by the
Building Official, or upon an order of the Building Official to disconnect such
service.
   (K)   Demolition by the city.  In the event that the owner of a building or
structure is unwilling or unable to comply with a requirement for demolition or
rehabilitation specified in an unsafe building order, the Building Official
shall proceed with the demolition in accordance with this section.
      (1)   Buildings subject to demolition.  A building or structure shall be
subject to demolition by the Building Official whenever:
         (a)   The building or structure has been deemed to be unsafe as
defined in §
152.30, and the provisions of §
152.25(A) through (G) have been exhausted, and the building or structure has
not been either brought into compliance with the FPBC or razed by the owner;
         (b)   The building or structure is at risk of imminent collapse; or
         (c)   The building is declared a nuisance in accordance with R.C.
Chapter 3767, or FPCO §
153.05.
      (2)   Administrative procedures.  The Building Official shall establish
procedures and timelines to standardize Building Department actions whenever
the Building Official becomes aware of a building or structure which is or may
become subject to demolition by the city.  These procedures shall be consistent
with §§ 109 and 110 of the OBC or RCO, R.C. §§ 119.06 to 119.13, 715.26 and
715.261, and R.C.  Chapters 3767, 3781 and 3791, as those provisions of Ohio
law are applicable.  Administrative procedures for the demolition of a building
or structure shall include, at a minimum, the following:
         (a)   Prepare a Report of Inspection and Evaluation for Condemnation
over the signature of the Building Official.
         (b)   Obtain Statement of Departmental Evaluation of Property
Conditions and Activities from the Fire, Police, Community Development and/or
Public Works departments.
         (c)   Obtain a title search for the property from a title search
company.
         (d)   Obtain a survey of the property in question from a person or
company experienced in the rehabilitation of buildings to determine whether the
condition of the property is a factor seriously depreciating neighborhood
property values.
         (e)    Schedule a public hearing to determine whether the building or
structure constitutes a public nuisance such that it should be demolished.
         (f)   Send notices of the public hearing to all known parties with an
interest in the property, and to others as appropriate, by certified mail not
less than 30 days prior to the public hearing.
         (g)   Post a copy of the Notice of Public Hearing on the subject
premises not less than 30 days prior to the public hearing.
         (h)   Publish the Notice of Public Hearing in a local newspaper at
least once a week for three consecutive weeks prior to the public hearing.
         (i)   Conduct the public hearing by the Board of Building Appeals in
accordance with R.C. Chapter 119.
         (j)   Witnesses must be sworn before testifying.  Parties with
interest in the property shall be permitted to appear and be heard in person,
or be represented by an attorney, in opposition to the proposed demolition of
the building, and to do all of the following:
            1.   Present the party's position, arguments, and contentions;
            2.   Offer and examine witnesses and present evidence in support;
            3.   Cross-examine witnesses purporting to refute the party's
position, arguments, and contentions;
            4.   Offer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in
opposition to his or her position, arguments, and contentions;
            5.   Proffer any such evidence for entry into the record, if the
Building Department Director has previously not entered it into the record.
         (k)   If, from the evidence received at the public hearing, the Board
of Building Appeals concludes:
            1.   The city has exhausted reasonable efforts to cause the
building to be brought into compliance with the FPBC; and
            2.   The subject building is a public nuisance under the standards
of this section or because of age, obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration,
lack of maintenance or repair or any combination thereof constitutes a serious
fire hazard, a serious health hazard, a substantial and unreasonable
interference with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises
within the neighborhood or a factor seriously depreciating property values in
the neighborhood, then the Building Official shall proceed as further indicated
herein.
         (l)   Notify all parties with an interest in the property of the Board
of Building Appeals decision by certified mail, by posting the decision on the
premises, and by publication at least once in the local newspaper.  Again
notify all parties of the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.
         (m)   Obtain City Manager determination of city intent to demolish.
         (n)   Obtain a City Council Resolution to affirm the City Manager's
intent to cause demolition of the property.
         (o)   Obtain at least three bids from demolition contractors to
demolish the structure and restore the property to a safe condition.
         (p)   Notify the demolition contractors of the winning bid, and
negotiate a contract, with specifications, for the work to be accomplished.
         (q)   Proceed with demolition if there is no appeal of the Notice of
Intent to Demolish within 30 days of the Notice of Intent to Demolish.
      (3)   Stay of hearing.  The Building Official may stay the conduct of a
hearing or continue a hearing in progress for up to 30 days if:
         (a)   The subject building has been sold or transferred and if the
Building Official is satisfied  that its new owner has the present capacity and
intent to bring the subject building and its premises into compliance with the
FPBC or be taken down and removed, within 30 days or such other time as may be
allowed by the Building Official; or
         (b)   The owner has applied for and obtained an administrative stay
pursuant to §
152.25(K)(4) below.
      (4)   Administrative stay.  The owner of any building subject to
demolition under the above administrative procedures may apply to the Building
Official for a stay of the demolition.  The owner shall give to the City
Treasurer a bond in the amount equal to the costs of demolishing the building
or restoring the premises to a safe condition as estimated by the Building
Official.  The administrative stay shall be conditioned upon the owner’s
causing the subject building to be brought into compliance with the FPBC. The
Building Official may grant a stay for a period not to exceed 90 days on
finding that the delay in demolition will not pose an imminent peril to the
public.  The director may extend a stay for an additional 90 days on being
satisfied that the owner is diligently causing the building to be brought into
compliance with the FPBC.  If the owner fails to bring the building into
compliance with the FPBC within the period of the stay, the bond shall be
forfeited.  The owner may otherwise obtain a permit to either demolish or
rehabilitate the building or structure within 30 days of the Notification of
Board of Building Appeals decision, and agree to comply with the conditions of
the permit.  Failing an administrative stay or issuance of a building permit,
the director shall then proceed with the condemnation and demolition process to
demolish the building and restore the premises to a safe condition, free from
any public nuisance, and certify the costs incurred to the City Treasurer for
payment from the proceeds of the forfeiture.
   (L)   Payment of insurance proceeds following a fire loss.  No insurance
company doing business in the city shall pay a claim of a named insured for
fire damage to a structure located within the city, unless the procedures set
forth herein are fully satisfied.
      (1)   If the fire loss otherwise payable to a named insured, as
determined or agreed to by the named insured or insureds and the company or
companies issuing fire loss policies, equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the company or companies shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the City
Manager in the aggregate $2,000 for each $15,000, and each fraction of that
amount, of a claim or, if, at the time of a proof of loss determined or agreed
to between the named insured or insureds and insurance company or companies,
the named insured or insureds have submitted a contract or signed estimate of
the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure,
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the
estimate.
      (2)   The transfer of proceeds required herein shall be on a pro rata
basis by all companies insuring the building or other structure.  Policy
proceeds remaining after the transfer of funds to the municipal corporation
shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
      (3)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contract or signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer of funds required by division (L)(1).  If so, the
City Manager shall return the amount of the fund that exceeds the estimate
given by the named insured or insureds, provided that the city has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.  If the
city has begun any such removal, repair or security of the building or other
structure, then the city shall be entitled to retain that portion of the funds
to fully pay the estimate and also all expenses previously incurred by the
city.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the proceeds required herein, the City Manager
shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security
against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing any building or
structure as incurred by the city pursuant to R.C. § 715.261.
      (5)   Upon the receipt from an insurance company of the name and address
of the named insured or insureds, the city shall notify by certified mail the
named insured or insureds that the insurance proceeds have been received by the
city, and that the following procedures will be followed:
         (a)   The fund received shall be returned to the named insured or
insureds when the repairs, removal or security of the building or other
structures have been completed, and written proof received by the City Manager,
if the city has not itself incurred any cost for the repairs, of removal or
securing.
         (b)   The city will be reimbursed from this fund any amounts it has
incurred for the cost to repair, remove or secure, in full or in part, any
damaged building or structure for which the fund monies were received.
         (c)   The amount of monies held in the fund that are not needed to
reimburse the city for costs incurred shall be returned to the named insured or
insureds no later than 60 days after the City Manager receives the written
proof of repairs.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the city to recover any deficiency under R.C. § 715.261.
      (7)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the city and
the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the
transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (M)   Disposition of personal property.  With respect to a determination
that a building is unsafe pursuant to this division (M) the notice provided to
any owner, occupier or person with interest in the building structure or
equipment proposed for demolition shall, when applicable, include language
indicating that all personal property in, around, or in any way upon the entire
real estate subject to the demolition order shall be removed or otherwise
disposed of by the owner, occupier or other person or entity of interest within
30 days after service of the notice of demolition. If said property is not

as an adjudication order, allowing appeal of such order in accordance with §
154.58(A) and (B), or otherwise indicating plan revisions or other
documentation required for approval. The Building Official may issue a partial
or fast track approval as may be warranted by the completeness of the
construction documentation.
         (e)   Distribution of approved construction documents. The Building
Department shall retain two sets of the approved construction documents (one
for the file, and one for the inspector), and provide one (or more as requested
by the owner) to the owner for retention on the job site.
      (4)   Abandonment of application. The denial of a permit or approval is
an adjudication order in accordance with §
154.58(B), requiring response within 30 days if appealed, or within six months
if otherwise pursued. Failure of response to a denial of permit/approval after
six months shall be considered to be abandonment of the application, requiring
reapplication if the project is to be pursued.
      (5)   Posting of permit. A true copy of the building permit or such other
instrument serving the purpose as the Building Official may authorize or
approve shall be posted on the site of operations open to public inspection
during the entire time of prosecution of the work and until the completion of
same.
   (I)   Conditions of permit.
      (1)   Payment of fees. No permit shall be issued and no amendment to a
drawing, application for permit, or other submission shall be approved or
certified until fees prescribed in
Chapter 156 (Comprehensive Fee Schedule) have been paid.
      (2)   Compliance. A permit shall be an authorization to proceed with the
work, but shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set
aside any of the provisions of this chapter, zoning laws or other applicable
laws, except as specifically allowed by lawfully granted modification or
deviation. Permit issuance shall not prevent the Building Official from
thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in construction or of
violations of this chapter.
      (3)   Compliance with approved documents. All work shall accurately
conform to the approved application, plans, and drawings for which the permit
has been issued and any approved amendments thereto.
      (4)   Change in plot. No lot or plot shall be changed, increased or
diminished in area from that shown in the application for permit without first
amending the application to that effect, except where the change is caused by
reason of an official street opening, street widening or other public
improvement.
      (5)   Lot lines. It shall be illegal to sell, lease or provide an
easement over any land at any time, if by virtue of such sale, lease or
easement any clearance, yard or court space prescribed by the Building Code,
this chapter, or the zoning ordinance, or other applicable law for Fire
Department access or for other legal purposes is reduced to such an extent as
to constitute a violation of other laws.
      (6)   Lot line markers. As may be required due to setback requirements,
all lot lines shall be clearly marked at their intersections with permanent
markers, and the structure perimeters shall be marked with markers which are
offset at an established distance.
      (7)   Expiration. The approval of plans and permits are invalid if
construction, erection, alteration, or other work described by the application
and plans are not commenced within 12 months of the approval date. One
extension shall be granted for an additional 12 month period if requested by
the owner prior to the expiration of the approval, and upon payment of a fee
not to exceed $100.
      (8)   Extension. If, in the course of construction, work is delayed or
suspended for more than six months, the permit becomes invalid. One extension
shall be granted extending the approval to no longer than one year after the
original approval upon application by the owner prior to the expiration of the
first approval.
      (9)   Duplicate. Upon application by the owner, the Building Official
shall issue a duplicate permit/approval to replace a lost or destroyed
original.

§ 154.53  INSPECTION.
   (A)   General.  Before issuing a permit in accordance with requirements of
this chapter, the Building Official may examine or cause to be examined the
property upon which the improvement is to be made in connection with which an
application has been filed.
   (B)   Duty to inspect.  The Building Official shall conduct or cause to be
conducted such inspections from time to time during and upon completion of the
work for which he or she has issued such permits in accordance with this
chapter, and as he or she may deem necessary to determine that the work is in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the approved drawings and
specifications.  The Building Official shall maintain a record of all such
examinations, inspections and of all violations of the Code.
   (C)   No duty to inspect.  The Building Official has no duty to inspect work
exempted from permit requirements in accordance with the Building Code, and not
otherwise required by this chapter, nor any other work for which no permit has
been issued.
   (D)   Inspection by others.  The Building Official may accept in lieu of
inspection by himself or herself or his or her staff inspectors, reports of
inspection for any part of the work regulated by this chapter by any third
party approved by the Building Official to make such inspections.
   (E)   Inspection procedures.  Inspections of the various stages of work must
be called for by the applicant before covering any work, and made at the
direction of the Building Official.
   (F)   Notice. It shall be mandatory that the holder of a permit notify the
proper inspection agency when work is ready for the various "called for"
inspections required by the terms of the permit. Such notice shall be given
within a reasonable time before the inspection is desired, but in no event less
than 24 hours in advance. Notice given on Friday or on a day prior to a legal
holiday shall not constitute notice for inspection on a Saturday, Sunday or
holiday, unless arrangements have been made for inspection on such days. Before
giving such notice, the holder of the permit shall first test the work and
satisfy himself or herself that it conforms to the approved plans and
specifications and the requirements of this chapter. Access to and means for
inspection of such work shall be provided for by the owner or contractor. Work
shall be accessible and exposed for inspection purposes.
   (G)   Action on notice. Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for
inspection, the Building Department or agency shall inspect the work as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, failure of the agency to make a prompt
inspection shall not be deemed justification for covering work without
inspection when such work is required to be inspected before being covered.
   (H)   Covering work. It shall be a violation of this chapter to cover any
work prior to the inspections required under the provisions of a permit or the
approved rules, unless a requested inspection has not been made within four
days of the request. The Building Official shall require the holder of the
permit to uncover any such work for inspection, and the cost of uncovering such
work and of replacing the cover after the work has been found or made
satisfactory shall be borne by the holder of the permit.
   (I)   Right of entry. Whenever necessary to make an inspection under this
chapter, or to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the
Building Official or his or her authorized representative has reasonable cause
to believe that there exists in any structure or upon the premises dangerous,
unsafe or substandard (as defined in the Building Code
Chapter 152) conditions, the Building Official or his or her authorized
representative may enter such premises at all reasonable times to inspect the
same or to perform any duty imposed upon the Building Official under this
chapter.
   (J)   Final inspection and certificate. It shall be the duty of the Building
Official to make or cause to be made a final inspection and examination of all
structures and work regulated by this chapter hereafter erected, constructed,
altered, repaired or added to, before any such structure is placed into use;
and, if such a structure has been found to have been constructed in conformity
to the provisions of the code, to issue a written certificate thereof to the
owner as set forth below.
      (1)   Temporary occupancy. Upon the request of the holder of a permit,
the Building Official may issue a temporary certificate of completion for a
structure, or part thereof, before the entire work covered by the permit shall
have been completed.
      (2)   The term of a temporary certificate of completion shall be at the
discretion of the Building Official; but, in no case shall the term of the
first issuance or extension of a temporary certificate of completion be longer
than 30 days. An additional fee in accordance with
Chapter 156 of the FPCO shall be paid by the owner or owner representative for
the first temporary certificate of completion, and the fee shall be thereafter
doubled for each extension of a temporary certificate of completion.
      (3)   The applicant will be subject to penalties provided in this chapter
if he or she allows occupancy or use before final inspection has been made and
a certificate of completion has been issued.

be minimum requirements, and where not in conflict with any specific provision
herein, nothing shall prohibit any person from exceeding these minimum
requirements. The Building Official responsible for the enforcement of this
chapter shall have the first administrative authority to interpret and
determine the intent and meaning of these provisions for enforcement purposes,
and is authorized to issue policies and procedures in order to maintain

   (A)   Responsibility. The owner of a structure or premises in or on which
conditions addressed by the requirements of this chapter are applicable shall
have the final responsibility for every violation of any provision of this
chapter. However, any person, firm or corporation which performs work for which
a permit is required by this chapter without first having secured a permit
therefor; and, every person, firm or corporation who shall violate or assist in

this chapter shall be in violation thereof and subject to the penalties
provided.
   (B)   Notice. The denial of any approval, or any action in response to
findings of non-compliance by the Building Official shall be an adjudication
order allowing the person or entity receiving an order the right to appeal
within 30 days of the mailing of the order, or to comply with the order, or to
otherwise be released from the order. The Building Official shall service
written notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter, of violation of
construction documentation approved thereunder, or of violation of a permit or
certificate issued under this chapter, on the person(s) responsible for such
violation or for its remedy in accordance with this section as an adjudication
order, with right of appeal. The adjudication order shall require the
discontinuance of illegal action or conditions, the abatement or correction of
any such violation, or the taking of such action as may be necessary to achieve
compliance with this chapter. In addition to the adjudication order, the

and/or the person(s) doing the work.
      (4)   Include the procedure for appeal and right to a hearing if
requested within 30 days of the order date. The order shall also indicate that,

order, or otherwise be released from the order by the Building Official.
   (D)   Prosecution of violation. If such violation is not corrected or such
order is not complied with in the time noted on the notice, and there is no
appeal of the order, the Building Official shall request legal counsel of the
city to institute appropriate proceedings at law or in equity to restrain,
correct, abate or punish such violation of this chapter or of such order.
Failure to cease work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a
public nuisance.
   (E)   Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter
or fail to comply with any of its requirements or do any work upon or in
connection with any premises or structures in violation of an approved plan
therefor or a directive relating thereto made by the Building Official, or of a
permit certificate issued under this chapter may be prosecuted and be subject
to a fine in accordance with

addition to any civil or administrative remedies, be subject to criminal
prosecution of such conduct or omission.
      (2)   If the offending person or entity receives a notice pursuant to
this chapter for corrective action, or to stop all work pending corrective
action, and said person or entity fails to obey said notice, that person shall
be charged with a violation, and such charge shall be considered a minor
misdemeanor subject to a fine not to exceed $150. If two or more notices are
given for the same unlawful conduct or failure to comply, said violation shall
constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor subject to punishment of up to a maximum
of $500 fine and 30 days incarceration. Each and every subsequent violation
will be considered a separate fourth degree misdemeanor offense subject to
separate charges and punishment.
   (F)   Unlawful continuance. Failure to cease work after receipt of an order
to stop work is declared a public nuisance.
   (G)   Abatement. Further, as provided in R.C. § 715.30, in the event any
structure or site work is being erected, constructed, altered, repaired or
maintained in violation of these regulations, the Attorney for the city, the
Building Official, or any adjacent, contiguous or neighboring property owner
who would be especially damaged by such violation, in addition to the remedies
provided by law, may institute a suit for injunction, abatement or other
appropriate action to prevent such violation of these regulations relating to
the erection, construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of such
structure.
   (H)   Legal action. The imposition of any fine shall not preclude the
Building Official from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a
court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use; or to
restrain, correct, or abate a violation or to prevent an illegal act in or
about any premises or to require compliance with provisions of this chapter or
applicable laws, ordinances, rules, resolutions, or the order or determinations
of the Building Official or the Board of Appeals, provided that the Building
Official has first complied with the procedures established in this chapter.
   (I)   Board of Appeals. The Forest Park Board of Building Appeals shall be
the appropriate body to hold public hearings and hear appeals of Building
Official actions related to
Chapter 154, Subchapter E. Appeals procedures shall be those identified in FPCO

   (J)   Unsafe conditions. The Building Official shall examine every property
reported or observed to be damaged, dangerous, structurally unsafe, or
constituting a health or fire hazard as defined in §
152.30; and he or she shall cause a report of such examination to be prepared
and filed in a docket of unsafe or damaged structures and premises, stating the
use of the structure and the nature and estimated amount of any such damage.
      (1)   Uncovering defects. Whenever it is established by inspection that a
definite and serious hazard to safety or health may exist, the Building
Official shall have the right to require the removal of cover or obstruction
concealing suspected unsafe conditions to permit adequate inspection thereof;
but, the extent of such removal shall be that reasonably necessary for such
inspection.
      (2)   Right of condemnation.
         (a)   When a premises or structure is or hereafter shall become
unsafe, substandard, unsanitary or which is or shall constitute a fire hazard,
or is or shall become, in any way, dangerous to human life or public welfare,
or which, by reason of illegal or improper use, occupancy or maintenance, is or
shall become unsafe, it may be ordered demolished by the Building Official in
accordance with this section. Such order shall be issued only after proper
inspection and evaluation by the Building Official. The results of such
evaluation and the professional opinion of the Building Official shall be the
factors which determine the terms of the order. Demolition work shall comply
with §
154.65.
         (b)   As an alternative, the Building Official may permit the owner to
make proper repairs to remediate the hazard. Such repairs shall render the
property safe and standard as deemed necessary by the Building Official and as
provided in this section or any other applicable laws, ordinances or
resolutions. The Building Official shall, when issuing the unsafe building
order, allow the owner the choice of demolition or repair. When the option to
rehabilitate a premises is accepted, the owner of the building or structure
shall, within 30 days, make application for a permit to repair, or, if plans
are required to obtain a permit, provide to the Building Official a letter of
intent to obtain a permit prior to a date specified and approved by the
Building Official. If the permit is not obtained within the time specified, or
if the work is not pursued in accordance with the terms of the permit, as
authorized by this chapter, the Building Official may order a structure
demolished without option of repair.
      (3)   Unsafe structure/premises.
         (a)   If an unsafe, substandard or unsanitary condition is found in a
structure or on the premises, the Building Official shall serve on the owner,
or owners of record, agent or person in control of the premises a written
order, hereinafter referred to as an "Unsafe Structure/Premises Order." Such
order shall designate the structure or premises, describing the repairs or
improvements required to render the premises safe, secure and/or sanitary,
ordering that such repairs or improvements be made or that the premises or
unsafe portion thereof be demolished, within a period also stipulated in the
order not less than 30 days after by the date of the Unsafe Structure/Premises
Order.

address of the owner, agent or person in control of such unsafe premises in
accordance with this chapter.
      (4)   Posting unsafe structure/premises orders. If neither the owner,
agent or person in control of such unsafe premises can be found within the city
after reasonable diligent search, the unsafe premises order shall be sent to
one of them by registered or certified mail directed to his or her last known
address, and a copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place on such
property; and such procedure shall be deemed the equivalent of personal notice
or service.
      (5)   Required response to order. The person upon whom the unsafe
structure/premises order is served is required to give notice, in writing, to
the Building Official within five days of receipt of such order, stating
whether he or she intends to comply with the unsafe structure/premises order.
If the order is in the alternative, as to repair or demolition, he or she shall
indicate what action he or she intends to take.
      (6)   Appeals.
         (a)   The owner of any premises or structure against which an unsafe
structure/premises order has been issued and served under this section, shall
have the right to appeal such order as provided under this section.
         (b)   Such appeal shall be presented in writing within 30 days after
service of such unsafe structure/premises, but shall not operate to stay any
emergency action or the performance of any emergency work on a premises which
the Building Official deems immediately necessary; nor shall such appeal be
heard unless it alleges such order to be unnecessary, improper or unreasonable,
and contains a statement of the specific reasons which the appellant contends
support such allegation(s).
      (7)   Disregard of unsafe structure/premises order. Upon refusal of the
person on whom an unsafe structure/premises order is served to comply
therewith, or upon his or her failure or neglect to reply thereto stating his
or her intention with regard thereto, or upon his or her use of the unsafe
premises, structure, equipment, or service facilities in violation of the
unsafe structure/premises order issued under this section, the proper legal
official shall be advised and may institute such action in the courts as may be
appropriate to compel compliance or to recover the costs of demolition by the
city.
      (8)   Demolition by the city. In the event that the owner of a structure
is unwilling or unable to comply with a requirement for demolition or
rehabilitation specified in an unsafe structure/premises order, the Building
Official shall proceed with the demolition in accordance with this section.
         (a)   Structures/premises subject to demolition. A structure shall be
subject to demolition by the Building Official whenever:
            1.   The structure has been deemed to be unsafe as defined in §

         (b)   Administrative procedures. The Building Official shall establish
procedures and timelines to standardize Building Department actions whenever
the Building Official becomes aware of a premises or structure which is or may
become subject to demolition by the city. These procedures shall be consistent
with this section, R.C. §§ 119.06 to 119.13, R.C. §§ 715.26 and 715.261, and
R.C. Chapters 3767, 3781 and 3791, as those provisions of Ohio law are

or premises constitutes a public nuisance such that it should be demolished.
            6.   Send notices of the public hearing to all known parties with

structure and/or premises to be brought into compliance with the FPBC; and
               b.   The subject structure/premises is a public nuisance under
the standards of this section or because of age, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or any combination thereof
constitutes a serious fire hazard, a serious health hazard, a substantial and
unreasonable interference with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of
other premises within the neighborhood or a factor seriously depreciating
property values in the neighborhood, then the Building Official shall proceed
as further indicated here.
            12.   Notify all parties with an interest in the property of the

   (K)   Stay of hearing. The Building Official may stay the conduct of a
hearing or continue a hearing in progress for up to 30 days if:
      (1)   The subject structure/premises has been sold or transferred, and if
the Building Official is satisfied that its new owner has the present capacity
and intent to bring the subject building and its premises into compliance with
the FPBC or be taken down and removed, within 30 days or such other time as may
be allowed by the Building Official; or
      (2)   The owner has applied for and obtained an administrative stay
pursuant to division (L) below.
   (L)   Administrative stay. The owner of any structure subject to demolition
under the above administrative procedures may apply to the Building Official
for a stay of the demolition. The owner shall give the City Treasurer a bond in
the amount equal to the costs of demolishing the structure and restoring the
premises to a safe condition as estimated by the Building Official, conditioned
on the owner's causing the subject structure to be brought into compliance with
the FPBC or this chapter. The Building Official may grant a stay for a period
not to exceed 90 days on finding that the delay in demolition will not pose an
imminent peril to the public. The Director may extend a stay for an additional
90 days on being satisfied that the owner is diligently causing the structure
to be brought into compliance with this chapter. If the owner fails to bring
the structure into compliance within the period of the stay, the bond shall be
forfeited. The owner may otherwise obtain a permit to either demolish or
rehabilitate the structure within 30 days of the Notification of Board of
Building Appeals decision, and agree to comply with the conditions of the
permit. Failing an administrative stay or issuance of a building permit, the
Director shall proceed with the condemnation and demolition process to demolish
the structure and restore the premises to a safe condition, free from any
public nuisance.
   (M)   Emergency measures.  When, in the opinion of the Building Official,
there is actual and immediate risk of failure or collapse of a structure, or
any part thereof, or the existence of defective equipment or service facilities
such as to endanger life or health, or when any structure or part of a
structure has fallen or failed, and use or occupancy of the premises,
structure, equipment, service facility and/or equipment or part thereof would
endanger life or health, he or she is hereby authorized and empowered to order
and require the occupants to vacate the premises or structure, and/or to
forthwith cease, desist and refrain from use or operation of the structure,
equipment, service facility or part thereof which is deemed dangerous. If such
order is made, he or she shall cause to be posted a notice to the effect that
"This Structure/Premises is Unsafe and Its Use or Operation is Prohibited by
Law."
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person thereafter to enter, use and/or
operate such premises, structure, or any part, equipment, service facility
thereof. Repair or demolition personnel may enter after notice to the Building
Official and issuance of permits.
      (2)   Emergency work. The Building Official shall also cause such work to
be done as may be necessary to render such premises, structure, equipment,
service facility or part thereof temporarily safe with regard to passersby and
adjacent properties, as well as to occupants, pending vacating and repair or

§ 154.70  SITE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General.  As a rule, this code provides for a single, primary building
on an individual lot.  Any and all other structures on the lot shall be
considered accessory structures.
      Exception:  Complexes where several primary buildings are located on one
parcel of land, such situations shall be controlled by the Ohio Building Code
and the City Zoning Code.
   (B)   Relationship to Zoning Code.  Buildings shall be located within the
buildable area of the lot, fully providing for the requirements of the Zoning
Code.
   (C)   Site access.  Each building site shall be planned so the building can
be used and maintained from an abutting street without trespass upon adjoining
properties.
      (1)   Means of entrance.  A means of entrance shall be provided from the
public right-of-way to the building.  The means of entrance shall be a legal,
permanent, uninterrupted, unobstructed system of access roads, driveways and
walks.
      (2)   Easements.  The use of easements to cross other properties is
permitted where land configuration dictates, but such easement must be detailed
on the site plan for evaluation of the access systems and shall be recorded in
all applicable deeds.  Where access easements are used/required, the following
statement shall be placed on the site plan:
      “The City of Forest Park does not accept any private easements shown on
this plat and is not obligated to maintain or repair any installations in said
easement.  The applicant agrees, as a condition of approval of this plat, that
there will be included in the deed of conveyance of every lot in this
subdivision subservient to an access easement a condition requiring the
grantee, his heirs and assigns, to continually maintain the easement area for
the purpose designed and a condition that within such easement no structure,
planting or other material shall be placed or permitted to remain which may
obstruct, retard or change the use of the easement, such conditions being for
the mutual benefit of the owners of all lots on which similar easements are
reserved.”
   (D)   Paving requirements.  The required means of entrance from the public
street to the building shall be a system of a sidewalk or hard-surfaced path, a
driveway and any necessary access roads. All drives and parking areas shall be
surfaced per division (5) below. The walkway serving the building main entrance
shall be per division (5) below, or of an otherwise approved hard surface.
      (1)   Slope of walkways.  Slope of non-vehicular entrance means or any
service means shall be limited to a maximum gradient of one inch per foot (8%),
except where the more restrictive requirements of the OBC, RCO, or ANSI A117.1
apply.
      (2)   Width of walkways.  Minimum width of the main entrance walk means,
from the driveway or from the street, shall be three feet; the minimum width of
any other walk or path shall be two feet.
      (3)   Slope of drives. 
         (a)   Slopes on driveways and access roads shall be limited to a
maximum gradient of one and three-quarter  inches per foot (14%).  Driveways
which are level (no slope in any direction), approach dead-level, or which hold
“pocket” water, are not permitted.  A positive slope of minimum dimensions
shall be provided to drain the driveway into the formal storm drainage system
or to an approved natural drainage feature.  No slope may start anywhere in the
public right-of-way other than as required by the City Engineer or Public Works
Director.
         (b)   Slopes of drives at garages.  Drives must slope down away from a
garage to a point at least 12 inches below the garage floor, or a trench drain
with a minimum six-inch diameter drain to an appropriate out fall such as a
drainage swale shall be installed in the drive adjacent to and the full length
of the garage door.
      (4)   Width of the drives.  Minimum width of a driveway is eight feet.
When the main walk is incorporated with the driveway, the combined width shall
be no less than ten feet.
      (5)   Surfacing.  All driveways outside of the public right- of-way and
all areas used for off-street parking shall be surfaced with a minimum
thickness of four inches of concrete (minimum psi in accordance with the OBC or
RCO as appropriate) or bituminous pavement to a minimum depth of two inches
over a base of five inches of compacted aggregate base (minimum standard ODOT
Item 304) or such thickness of other appropriate road material as may be
comparable to the above specified concrete or bituminous paving and is
specifically approved by the City Manager. Gravel is not an acceptable drive or
parking surface material except in the rear setback of M and IP districts.
      (6)   Location of drives.  No driveway paved surface or any other paved
surface may be closer to a property line than two feet. No driveway or access
road shall be constructed within the limits of any road pavement radius return
at any road intersection.
      (7)   Maximum width.  The maximum width of a paved drive or total width
of all paved surface, within the front yard setback, shall be 35% of the lot
frontage.
      (8)   Turnarounds. When a turnaround is appended to a private drive, the
maximum dimensions of the turnaround are 15 feet long and nine feet wide, with
maximum five foot by five foot flares on each side adjacent to the drive.
   (E)   Work in public right-of-way.  All construction in the public right-of-
way shall meet the following provisions, as required by the City Engineer and
the Public Works Director.
      (1)   Permit required.  Any alteration of the right of way, berm, and/or
ditch area relative to the driveway or access road construction shall conform
to the standards of the City Engineer, and shall be done under a permit from
the Public Works Director.
      (2)   Drives to road without curbs.  Any driveway or access road
connecting to a road having no curb shall, at the property line, be constructed
no higher than eight inches above the existing center line of the road pavement
measured at a point opposite the driveway location, and no lower than an
elevation level with the existing center line of the road pavement, except at
the discretion of the City Engineer.
      (3)   Culvert required.  All driveways or access roads constructed across
ditches shall have a 12-inch minimum diameter reinforced concrete pipe
installed in the ditch under the driveway in accordance with city standard
drawings.
      (4)   Drives to road with curb.  Any driveway or access road connecting
to a road with a curb section shall, at the property line, be constructed to an
elevation based on 1/4 to 3/4-inch per foot, ascending from the top of the
rolled curb, or top of depressed vertical curb, for the distance from the back
of the curb to the property line.
      (5)   Drives to be located away from hazards.  No part of any driveway,
driveway approach or access road within the public right-of-way shall be
installed closer than five feet to any inlet, fire hydrant, utility pole or guy
wire anchor.

§ 154.72  GRADING AND DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Grading.  The individual building site or developed lot shall be
graded in accordance with Chapter 51, Stormwater Management code, and Chapter
151, Subdivision Rules and Regulations.
      (1)   Site plan.  The final grading of the site and the associated
drainage system must comply, in general, with the above.  The site plan shall
show, in addition to all improvements, all revisions being made to the site
which do not conform to the approved grading plan for the subdivision.
      (2)   Alteration of existing slopes.  When the lot is graded to a higher
or lower level than the existing grade, the owner shall provide slopes (max. 3:
1), retaining walls, or other approved protection, on his property, to preserve
the elevation of the adjoining property.  Steeper slopes may be approved by the
Building Official in special limited cases.
      (3)   Grading.  Grading shall be done as closely as possible to the
following criteria:
         (a)   Protective slopes around buildings shall slope downward from
building foundation to lower areas or drainage swales.
            1.   The horizontal length shall be ten feet except where
restricted by a property line.  Where restricted by a property line, a drainage
swale shall occur at the property line.
            2.   The minimum vertical fall of protective slopes in rear yards
shall be six inches.
         (b)   1.   In areas other than the protective slopes, the minimum
gradient shall be 2%.  When acceptable by the Building Official, lesser
gradients than that required above may be installed when a lesser gradient is
adequate to drain the lot without detrimental effect upon buildings or other
lot uses.  The maximum gradient shall be no steeper than 2:1.  If an
undisturbed slope is held by satisfactory existing vegetation or rock
outcropping, no limit shall be imposed on the maximum gradient as long as
present and future stabilization is assured.  Top and bottom of banks at
swales, terraces, etc. shall be rounded or otherwise constructed for convenient
maintenance.
            2.   Water being disposed of between houses shall be channeled
along the common property line to the drainage system, but in no case shall
water from more than one-half acre be collected and disposed of between
houses.  If water from more than one-half acre is collected, the drainage
system shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 51, Stormwater Management
Code.
      (4)   Major drainage system.  All parts of the grading and drainage
system shall be in conformity with the requirements for major drainage systems
as indicated on the subdivision plan.
         (a)   Grading shall be done so that the drainage pattern (in place or
approved) is not changed, and stormwater ground runoff to adjoining property is
not increased, redirected, concentrated or caused to spill off the property in
new locations, so as to create stormwater problems on adjacent property.
         (b)   Stormwater must be directed into the same watershed and in the
same general direction that existed prior to the site grading operation. 
Diversion into other watersheds is not permitted, except when approved for very
minor grading areas occurring totally within the newly developed lot, and then
only when no problem will be created on adjacent property.
         (c)   Work which is executed but is not in conformance with the
regulations and/or the approved site plan, shall be removed and remedial action
taken to bring the property into full compliance.
   (B)   Drainage.  The storm drainage system on each lot shall comply with the
above and shall include, but is not limited to the following:
      (1)   Stormwater disposal.  An approved surface and/or sub- surface
drainage system for the collection and disposal of storm runoff and sub-surface
water from the site to prevent flooding, erosion and standing water shall be
installed.  Concentrated storm drainage shall be directed to approve surface or
sub-surface drainage facilities as required herein.
      (2)   Adjacent properties.  The drainage system shall carry and discharge
storm water without producing any adverse effect on adjacent or downstream
properties. Retention facilities shall be provided, as required by the
Stormwater Management Code, to facilitate the containment and slow release of
storm runoff.
      (3)   Out-flow facilities.  The choice of outflow facilities lies with
the property owner, but shall be approved by the city, which reserves the right
to require use of another facility.  Such facilities shall include, but are not
limited to:
         (a)   Existing surface and piped facilities, such as swales,
watercourses, drainage easements, storm, sewers, etc. as regulated by the City
Engineer.
            1.   Use of storm sewers must be approved, in concept, by the
Public Works Director, and no such sewers shall be considered available, unless
it is low enough to allow the slope of the lateral entering it to meet the
requirements of the Public Works Director.
            2.   The storm sewer shall be considered available only if the
breaking or cutting of the flat paving in the public right-of-way, or if the
tunneling under the street to access the sewer is fully approved by the Public
Works Director.
               a.    Street drainage ditches and street gutters, via an outflow
pipe (through the curb, where applicable) as regulated within the public right-
of-way, by the Public Works Director.
               b.   Facilities, on the site, approved by the Plumbing Section,
Hamilton County Board of Health and the City Engineer.
            3.   Surface drainage.  Positive surface drainage shall be provided
for each lot so there is no pocketing of water on any surface.  This can be
accomplished by grading or installing catch basins, area drains, underdrains,
etc. property connected to approved disposal facilities.
               a.   Grading shall be done so that the existing natural ground
drainage of the area is not impeded, distorted or redirected.
            4.   Yard drainage.  Where no storm sewer is available, no garage
apron, driveway, stairwell, window (area) well, foundation drain, walkway,
below-grade entrance area, or any below-grade area subject to receiving storm
drainage shall be permitted unless it has a gravity drainage system or an
approved sump well and pump installation.
               a.   Outflow shall comply with §
152.72(B)(3), except that no clear water sump discharge shall be permitted into
a street gutter or onto a private or public sidewalk or roadway. Sump discharge
onto the property must be so that flow onto the sidewalk is restrained without
ponding.
            5.   Building drainage.  All new buildings, except accessory
buildings less than 800 square feet in area, or buildings with roof overhangs
of 12 inches or more that have a side yard of at least six feet six inches from
the far edge of the overhang to the property line, shall be equipped with
gutters and downspouts.
               a.   Without gutters.  Where no gutters are used the plans
submitted for the building permit shall show on a grade plan of the lot that
roof runoff water shall follow drainage swales formed by intersecting slopes
and that these swales carry water to some natural water course on the same
property or to street curb.
               b.   With gutters.  When gutters and downspouts or sump pumps
are used, their discharge shall be connected by a pipe to a storm sewer if
available.  If such sewer is not available, the collector pipe shall run to a
street gutter in conformance with division 6.a. below or street drainage ditch
if same is available.  If neither sewer, gutter nor street drainage ditch is
available, the collector shall run to a natural drainage course on the owner's
property.  The storm sewer shall not be considered to be available if the
public right-of-way paving would have to be broken to get to the sewer, or if
tunneling under the street would have to be resorted to.  Splash blocks may be
used in lieu of piping for downspouts provided they drain into approved
drainage swales.
            6.   Work in the right-of-way.  The following shall apply to all
work done in the right-of-way:
               a.   Curb cuts.  Curb cuts for downspout drains must be made
with a saw or other approved cutting tool.  Maximum pipe size through the curb
shall be three inches nominal. Top surface of the pipe must be at least one
inch below the highest part of the curb.  The pipe must cross the curb at a
right angle to the curb.  After cutting and installation of pipe, curb shall be
restored to original contours in an approved manner.  (Epoxy resin cement or
ThoroPatch are acceptable materials for curb repair).  Only cast iron pipe or
galvanized iron pipe may be used.  Said pipe shall extend from the curb to the
edge of the right-of-way.
               b.   Driveway approach.  Driveway approach must meet approved
standards.  The planting strip must be filled, graded and sodded.  All utility
boxes within the public right-of-way must be at grade level.
               c.   Additional fee.  In addition to the building permit fee,
the person or contractor shall be charged for inspection of all work within the
street and/or crosswalk right-of-way at the rate of inspection fees in effect
at the time of the inspection.  The city retains the right to deduct any
inspection charges from the bond posted prior to return of the bond amount.
               d.   Bond amount.  Bond amount to be posted by the builder to
assure proper compliance of construction within the right-of-way shall be as
prescribed in
Chapter 156 (Comprehensive Fee Schedule).
               e.   Hazardous defects.  If defects or conditions exist within
the right-of-way which is hazardous to the health and safety of the public, the
builder will be given written notice of these effects or hazardous conditions
by the city.  If after three working days these defects or conditions are not
corrected, the builder may be cited to court for violation of the code. The
city will then correct these defects or hazardous conditions.  The city will be
reimbursed for its work from the right- of-way bonds.  The city may use up to
the cash value of the right-of- way bonds on hand to correct these defects of
hazardous conditions.  The builder will then be required to put up cash for
each additional right-of-way bond which will be issued with the maximum amount
of cash required to be $500.  No further building permits shall be issued to
any builder until he or she has redeposited a sum sufficient to bring his or
her right-of-way deposit account up to its maximum limit of liability.
               f.   Work within the right-of-way.  All work within the right-
of-way must be completed and inspections made prior to the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.
   (C)   Survey.  Application for a permit for any new building must be
accompanied by the required number of site surveys of the property, prepared by
a registered surveyor.  This must show, in addition to the lot location, bounds
and building location on the lot, including the following information:
      (1)   Sewers.  Type of sewer (such as storm, sanitary, combined) material
and size of sewer, sea level elevations of sewer inverts at location of
laterals, inlets, outlets, catch basins, manholes (when sewer is to be
utilized); the proposed floor level of the lowest floor (including basement or
cellar) of building.
      (2)   Grading.  Accurate, field verified, sea level elevations of
existing grades; proposed final grades of yard to determine compliance with
this section.
      (3)   Drainage.  Drainage pattern and/or facilities that is available for

operator, or occupant; or if a copy is left at the place of residence of the

laws of the state.  If the owner, agent, operator or occupant of the subject
premises is unknown, then a copy of the notice and order shall be mailed,

morals, or welfare of the occupants of a building or of the public, he may,
without prior notice or hearing, issue an order citing the violation and
directing that such action be taken as is necessary to remove or abate the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Forest Park, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows
below.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Forest Park has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Forest Park as identified in §
157.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Forest Park.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study for Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, effective date of May 17, 2004. Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Hamilton
County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas; Map Numbers 3906100088 D, 3906100070 D,
3906100086 D, and 3906100065 D; effective date of May 17, 2004.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
include: None.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Forest Park as required by §
157.37, Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments, of this chapter.
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City of Forest Park Public Works Building,
Engineering Department, 1970 Waycross Road, Forest Park, Ohio.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Forest Park, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
DEFINITIONS
§ 157.15  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The base flood elevation plus one foot of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain
administrator, plus one foot of freeboard.
   FLOODWAY.  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one-half foot at any point within the
community. The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Ohio Historical Society, whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. For the purposes of
these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-
27-01, a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Forest Park
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, May 17, 2004, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3)
designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,
and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION  means the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and for floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
157.45 to
157.50, Appeals and Variances, of this chapter.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.31  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including

      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one-half foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one-half foot increase in the base flood elevation
may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one-half foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Division (A), items (a) and (c)-(e) of this section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RA/
I-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Forest Park specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
157.29(A)(1)(c) of this chapter when an alteration of a watercourse results in
the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.48  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Forest Park.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in divisions (C)(1)(a) to (k) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.49  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (B)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (C)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (D)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (E)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (F)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.
   (G)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (H)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.

Chapter 2506.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 157.55  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (A)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full

regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
§
157.28 of this chapter.
   (B)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation
of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with §
157.99.
   (C)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with §
157.99.
(Ord. 8-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.56  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give notice of such
violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with these
regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and order shall:
   (A)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

(Ord. 08-2004, passed 5-17-04)
§ 157.99  PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a fourth degree misdemeanor. Any person who violates these
regulations or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the City
of Forest Park. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a

Editor's note:
   This table lists those Ohio Revised Code sections which have been
substantially duplicated by corresponding Code of Ordinance sections.  All
legislative history references to "(R.C. § ____)" which appear at the end of
sections (or divisions of sections) in the city's Code of Ordinances have been
listed here.  Example: to determine which section of the Code of Ordinances is
based on R.C. § 2913.03, scan down this table to the citation for "2913.03" and
examine the entry across from it: in this case, the corresponding Code of
Ordinances section is § 134.07, which means that § 134.07 (or a part thereof)
is based directly on R.C. § 2913.03.
