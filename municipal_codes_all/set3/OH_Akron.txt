A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Akron, Ohio 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 19, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Akron, Ohio Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1993, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance list and disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 19, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 72-2019, passed March 11, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a code of ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on two tiers, beginning with chapter, and ending with section. For example, Section 10.01 is Section .01, in Chapter 10 of Title 1; Section 33.12 is Section .12 in Chapter 33 of Title 3. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number and year. (Example: (Ord. 272-1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
    As of Supplement No. 19, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (31, 53, 94.) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 19, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers headed by the number of the title in which the pages are found. Numbering sequences start over with each new chapter (Example: 9-1 is the first page of Title 9.). As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with points. (Example: 3-11, 3-11.1, 3-12.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

REMOVAL OF ELECTIVE OFFICERS BY RECALL 

SECTION 13. - PROCEDURE. 
    Any elective officer of the City may be removed from office by recall. The procedure to effect such removal shall be as follows: 
1.  A petition signed by qualified electors equal in number to at least twenty (20) percent of qualified electors who were registered to vote in the City at the last preceding general municipal election for the office subject to recall, and demanding the election of a successor to the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with the Clerk of Council. Such petition, and each petition paper, shall contain a general statement, in not more than two hundred words, of the grounds upon which removal is sought. The Clerk of Council shall not accept for filing any petition which does not purport to contain a circulator's affidavit and at least the minimum number of signatures required for the holding of a recall election. 
2.  Petition papers shall be procured only from the Clerk of the Council, who shall keep a sufficient number thereof on file for the use as herein provided. Prior to the issuance of such petition papers an affidavit shall be made by one or more qualified electors of the City and filed with the Clerk, stating the name and office of the officer sought to be removed. The Clerk, upon issuing any such petition paper, shall enter, in a record to be kept in his office, the name of the elector to whom issued, the date of such issuance, and the number of papers issued, and shall certify upon each paper the name of the elector to whom issued and the date of issuance. No petition paper so issued shall be accepted as part of a petition unless it bears such certificate of the Clerk and unless it is filed as provided in this section. 
3.  Such petition shall be addressed to the Council, and each signer must be an elector of the City. Signatures shall be in ink or indelible pencil. With each signature shall be stated the place of residence of the signer, giving the street and number. Such signatures need not all be on one paper. A person shall be designated in such petition to receive the same in case of return thereof by the Clerk of Council for insufficiency thereof, as hereinafter provided in this section. The circulator of every such paper shall make affidavit thereto, under penalty of election falsification, which affidavit shall contain a statement of the number of signers of such paper, that the affiant witnessed the affixing of every signature, and that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief, each of the signatures contained on such paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, that such persons are electors of the City, and that they signed such petition with the knowledge of the contents thereof. All such papers for the removal of any one officer shall be fastened together and be filed as one instrument within fifty (50) days after the filing with the Clerk of the affidavit stating the name and office of the officer sought to be removed. The Clerk of Council, within ten (10) business days after the filing of such petitions, shall determine the sufficiency of such petition and attach thereto a certificate showing the result of his examination. If the Clerk shall certify that the petition is insufficient, he shall set forth in the certificate the particulars in which the petition is defective, and shall return a copy of the certificate to the person designated in such petition to receive it. 
4.  No change may be made to the petition after filing with the Clerk except that any person who signs the petition may request in writing, in the presence of the Clerk, the removal of his or her signature at any time before submission of the Clerk's certificate to Council. 
5.  If the Clerk of Council shall determine that the petition is sufficient, he shall at once submit the same with his certificate to the Council at the next meeting of Council and forthwith notify the officer sought to be recalled of such action. If the officer whose removal is sought shall not resign within five (5) business days after such notice, the Council shall thereupon by order fix a day for holding a recall election. Such election shall be held not less than forty (40) nor more than sixty (60) days after the petition has been submitted to the Council as aforesaid, at the time of holding any general or special election held within such period, but if no such election shall be held within such period, the Council shall order a special recall election to be held within the time aforesaid. 
6.  The Clerk of Council shall forthwith transmit a duly certified copy of such order to the Director of the Board of Elections of Summit County, Ohio, or the successor to this position. The election authorities shall cause publication of notice and all arrangements to be made for holding such election, and the same shall be conducted and the result thereof returned and declared in all respects as are the results of general municipal elections. 
7.  Each ballot at such election shall have printed thereon the following question: "shall (name of person) be removed from the office of (name of office) by recall?" immediately following such question, there shall be printed on the ballot the following two propositions in following order: 
    "for the recall of (name of person)." 
    "against the recall of (name of person)." 
    Immediately to the left of each of said propositions shall be a space in which the elector may vote for either of such propositions. 
8.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling any elective officer shall be against the recall, the elected officer shall continue in office for the remainder of his unexpired term, but subject to recall as before. If a majority of such votes be for the recall of the elected officer on the ballot, then the elected officer shall be deemed removed from office upon the announcement of the official canvass of such elections. 
9.  When a person is removed from office by recall, the person removed by recall shall not be permitted to serve as successor for the unexpired term. Council shall immediately provide for the nomination and election of the successor for the unexpired term by fixing the time of the election. The nomination and election of a person to succeed a person so removed shall be made by nominating petition, primary election and election of the successor. Petitions shall be filed with the election authorities aforesaid at least twenty-five (25) days prior to such primary election. No petition for recall of any elected official shall be submitted to the Clerk of Council until the officer shall have served at least six (6) months of the term within which the recall is sought. No petition for recall of any elected official shall be submitted during the last six (6) months of the official's term of office. No petition for recall of any elected official who has already been subject to an unsuccessful recall election may be obtained from the Clerk of Council until at least six (6) months after the date of the previous recall election.

    Ordinances and resolutions providing for the exercise of any and all powers of government granted by the Constitution or now delegated or hereafter to municipal corporations by the General Assembly, may be proposed by initiative petition. Such initiative petition must contain the signatures of not less than seven (7) percent of the electors of the City. The full text of the proposed ordinance or resolution shall be set forth in such initiative petition. Initiative petitions shall be filed with the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall not accept for filing any petition which does not purport to contain at least the minimum number of signatures required for submission of the proposed law or amendment for the approval or rejection of the electors. The proposed ordinance or resolution shall be submitted for the approval or rejection of the electors of the City at the next succeeding general election occurring subsequent to sixty (60) days after such initiative petition is found to be sufficient by the Clerk of the Council as hereinafter provided.

SECTION 20. - APPLICATION OF REFERENDUM. 
    Any ordinance or resolution passed by the Council shall be subject to referendum except as hereinafter provided. Whenever the Council is by law required to pass more than one (1) ordinance or resolution to complete the legislation necessary to make and pay for any public improvement, the provisions of Sections 17 to 26, inclusive, in this Charter shall apply only to the first ordinance or resolution required to be passed and not to any subsequent ordinances or resolutions relating thereto. Ordinances or resolutions providing for appropriations for the current expenses of the City, or for street improvements petitioned for by the owners of the majority of the feet front of the property benefited and to be specially assessed for the cost thereof, and emergency ordinances or resolutions necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety shall go into immediate effect, or at the time stated in the ordinance. Such emergency ordinances or resolutions must, upon a "Yea" and "Nay" vote, receive the vote of two-thirds of all the members of the Council, and the reasons for such necessity shall be set forth in one (1) section of the ordinance or resolution. If, when submitted to a vote of the electors, an emergency measure be not approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall be considered repealed as regards any further action thereunder, and all rights and privileges conferred by it shall be null and void; provided, however, that such measure so repealed shall be deemed sufficient authority for any payment made or expense incurred in accordance with the measure previous to the referendum vote thereon. The provisions of Sections 17 to 26, inclusive, of this Charter shall apply to pending legislation provided for any public improvement.

SECTION 21. - THE PETITION-REQUIREMENTS, CONSTRUCTION, AND EFFECT OF ELECTION. 
    Any initiative or referendum petition may be presented in separate parts, but each part shall contain a full and correct copy of the title and text of the ordinance or resolution proposed or sought to be referred. Each signer of an initiative or referendum petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil. Each signer of an initiative or referendum petition must be an elector of the City. With each signature shall be stated the place of residence of the signer, giving the street and number. Each part of such petition shall contain the affidavit of the person soliciting the signatures to the same, which affidavit shall contain a statement of the number of signers of such part of such petition, that the affiant witnessed the affixing of every signature and that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief, each of the signatures contained on such part is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, that such persons are electors of the City, and that they signed such petition with the knowledge of the contents thereof. The petitions and signatures upon such petitions shall be prima facie presumed to be in all respects sufficient. No ordinance or resolution submitted to the electors of the City, and receiving an affirmative majority of the votes cast thereon, shall be held ineffective or void on account of the insufficiency of the petitions by which such submission of the same shall have been procured; nor shall the rejection by a majority of the votes cast thereon of any ordinance or resolution submitted to the electors of the City be held invalid for such insufficiency. The basis upon which the required number of petitioners in any case shall be determined shall be the total number of qualified electors registered to vote at the last general municipal election.

If the Clerk shall certify that the petition is insufficient he shall set forth in the certificate the particulars in which the petition is defective and shall return a copy of the certificate to the person designated in such petition to receive it. 
    If the Clerk of the Council shall determine that the petition is sufficient, he shall submit the same with his certificate to the Council at the next meeting of Council. No change may be made to the petition after filing with the Clerk except that any person who signs the petition may request in writing, in the presence of the Clerk, the removal of his or her signature at any time before submission of the Clerk's certificate to Council. 
    The Council shall thereupon order that the ordinance or resolution proposed or sought to be referred be submitted to the qualified electors of the City for their approval or rejection at an election to be held as here prescribed. The Clerk of Council shall forthwith transmit a duly certified copy of such order to the Director of the Board of Elections of Summit County, Ohio or the successor to this position.

It is also intended, however, that the Investment Officer is to seek competition in the investment of public money and therefore may invest all or part of that public money outside the depository banks. The general depository account may be in the form of a demand deposit account. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.33 - Special depository accounts.

2.  To meet contractual terms and conditions; 
3.  To provide cash management for City operations located outside of Summit County; 
4.  To obtain substantial savings in banking services; or 
5.  To provide separate deposit of certain public money when such deposit represents prudent fiscal policy. 
B.  The City shall maintain the following special depository accounts: 
1.  Bond Payment Fund; 
2.  Bond and coupon paying accounts; 
3.  Payroll disbursement/rotary 
4.  Geauga County watershed operations account; and 
5.  Any other special depository account established from time to time by ordinance. 
C.  All earnings on the investment of public money in a special depository account shall be credited to that special depository account except those earnings that are required to be credited to a particular account by ordinance or federal law. 
D.  A special depository account may be in the form of a demand deposit account, a savings account, nonnegotiable interest bearing time accounts or certificates of deposit, a checking account, a NOW account, Super NOW account, or other similar account, or other account form as may be agreed to by the Investment Officer. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.34 - Selection of depository banks. 
A.  The Investment Officer shall prepare and publish requests for proposals for banking services in such form and in such manner as determined by the Investment Officer and as approved by the Director of Law. Requests for proposals for banking services shall be made to eligible depository banks as often as deemed appropriate by the Investment Officer. 
B.  Following receipt of proposals for banking services, the Depository Commission shall select the eligible depository bank to serve as the general depository bank or special depository banks, provided that the Depository Commission may reject all proposals. The Director of Finance, on behalf of the city, shall enter into a depository agreement with each depository bank selected by the Depository Commission. The procedure for designation of depository banks set forth in this article is determined to be in accordance with Charter Sec. 93 of the city. 
C.  Public money deposited in depository banks or invested in accordance with this chapter shall be considered to be in the City treasury within the meaning of Charter Sec. 92 of the city. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 61l-1985) 
37.35 - Pledged collateral securities. 
A.  All public money deposited in the general depository account or in special depository accounts shall be secured by collateral securities pledged at market value in an amount equal to at least one hundred percent of the amount of the public money deposited less any amount covered by federal deposit insurance, or as otherwise provided for under state or federal banking laws regulating such depository accounts; provided that this requirement for collateralization is not applicable to a depository bank that has stated its inability to comply with this requirement but only with regard to public money that: 
1.  Is in excess of an amount then covered by federal deposit insurance; 
2.  Is held temporarily in a depository account for less than eight hours during a single business day of the depository bank; 
3.  Is in the depository account as a result of a transfer of public money from another depository account, the maturing or sale of investments, or the direct deposit of public money by the city, and 
4.  Is transferred from the depository account to another depository account that meets the collateralization requirement of this section, is invested in an eligible investment, or is withdrawn to pay obligations of the city. 
B.  Any collateral securities pledged pursuant hereto shall, at the option of the Investment Officer, be either delivered to the Investment Officer or deposited in an escrow or a trust account with a trustee for safekeeping for the account of the city. Any fees and expenses of the trustee shall be paid by the depository bank. 
C.  When collateral securities have been deposited in such an escrow or trust account, the depository bank may substitute or exchange other collateral securities having a current market value equal to or greater than the current market value of the collateral securities then on deposit and for which they are to be substituted for or exchanged if the Investment Officer either gives a written authorization for that substitution or exchange or has authorized the depository bank to make a substitution or exchange on a continuing basis during a specified period without prior approval of each substitution or exchange. The Investment Officer may send written authorization to the depository bank stating that substitution may be made on a continuing basis during the specified period and under the conditions specified therein. The depository bank shall notify the Investment Officer of any substitution or exchange of collateral securities. Upon request of the Investment Officer, the depository bank shall furnish a detailed statement setting forth the face and market values of all collateral securities pledged as security for deposits of the city. 
D.  The Investment Officer may require additional collateral securities to be delivered or deposited to provide for any depreciation that may occur in the market value of any of the collateral securities so delivered or deposited. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.36 - Failure to pay deposit. 
    If the depository bank fails to pay over any part of a deposit due the city, the Investment Officer shall have the option of selling in the manner determined by the Investment Officer any of the collateral securities deposited or segregated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. If the collateral securities are in an escrow or a trust account with a trustee, the Investment Officer may request the trustee to deliver to the Investment Officer any of the collateral securities so deposited and the Investment Officer shall have the option to sell such collateral securities in the manner determined by the Investment Officer. When a sale of collateral securities has been made, upon payment to the Investment Officer of the purchase money, the Investment Officer shall transfer such collateral securities to the purchaser whereupon the absolute ownership of the collateral securities shall pass to the purchaser. Any amount remaining after deducting the amount due the City and any expenses of the sale shall be paid to the depository bank. This rights provided herein are in addition and supplemental to any rights of the City to recover under R.C. Chapter 135. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.37 - Pooled collateral security. 
    With the written approval of the Depository Commission, a depository bank in lieu of pledging collateral securities in accordance with  37.35 hereof may provide collateral for public money deposited pursuant to this chapter through a single pool of collateral securities pledged for deposits of all public money of the city, the state, and other subdivisions held by the depository bank, in accordance with and pursuant to R.C.  135.181 and any amendments thereto. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.38 - Investment objectives. 
    The achievement of good fiscal management for the City requires effective cash management of public money and, in turn, effective bank management practices with respect to the investment and deposit of this public money. The following investment and deposit objectives shall be applied in the management of public money: 
A.  The primary objective of the City's investment activities is the preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal. 
B.  Those responsible for investing public money shall strive to maximize the return on the investments but shall avoid assuming unreasonable investment risks. 
C.  The City's investments shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the City to meet operating requirements that might reasonably be anticipated. 
D.  The City's investments shall be diversified to avoid the assumption of unreasonable and avoidable risks associated with specific types of securities or individual financial institutions. To the extent practicable, of the public money allocated to the general depository account, it is intended that no more than fifty percent will be invested in repurchase agreements, no more than fifty percent will be invested with any one eligible institution and no more than twenty percent will be invested with any one maturity date. 
E.  Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
F.  Price and rate quotations for all eligible investments may be obtained from eligible institutions within or outside of the City or the state. However, in the case of the sale or purchase of eligible investments where all other factors considered by the Investment Officer are equal, placement shall be made with the eligible institution situated within the city. The right is reserved to reject all bids or proposals or any bid if such is inconsistent with the City's investment objectives. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.39 - Investment practices. 
A.  The Investment Officer shall invest public money in the general depository account and special depository accounts only in eligible investments purchased only through or from eligible institutions. A list of eligible institutions through or from which the City may purchase eligible investments shall be maintained by the Investment Officer. The Investment Officer may revise such list from time to time to add other eligible institutions. The Investment Officer may delete eligible institutions from the list because of: 
1.  The failure of the eligible institution to meet the investment objectives of the city; 
2.  The request of the eligible institution; 
3.  The perception that the eligible institution is experiencing financial difficulties; 
4.  A consistent lack of competitiveness by the eligible institution; or 
5.  Inadequate service to the City by the eligible institution. 
B.  To the extent possible, the City's investments shall be made so as to complement its anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow requirement, the Investment Officer shall not invest in eligible investments maturing more than two years from date of purchase. The Investment Officer is authorized to pool cash balances from the several funds of the City for investment purposes. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.40 - Investment in City obligations.

(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985)

(Ord. 789-1986) 
37.42 - Reports and records. 
    The Investment Officer shall submit quarterly and annual reports to the Depository Commission and to City Council setting forth the investment and depository activity of the City for the preceding period, including the total balance in the custody of each depository bank. The Investment Officer shall report to the Depository Commission any substantial decrease in the market price, or, in his judgment, any substantial increase in the credit risk, of any eligible investment held by the city. The Investment Officer shall maintain the treasury investment account and any other necessary records of all investments and deposits. The Director of Finance shall establish procedures for internal controls that shall be reviewed annually by the independent auditor. These controls shall be designed to prevent loss of public money due to fraud, error, misrepresentation, unanticipated market changes, or imprudent actions. 
(Ord. 789-1986; Ord. 611-1985) 
37.43 - Liability for investments. 
    The Director of Finance, the Investment Officer, the Director of Law, the Mayor, and members of City Council shall not be liable for the loss of any public money deposited or invested pursuant to and in compliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, losses occasioned by the sale of any instruments, securities or obligations, the closing of any depository accounts, or the failure of any depository bank or eligible institution.

50.23 - Charges outside of City. 
    For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated outside of the corporate limits of the city and having any connection with the City's sewerage system or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the City's sewerage system, the charge to the owner of any such lot, parcel of land, building, or premises shall be based either on the quantity of water used thereon or therein as the same is estimated or measured by a water meter there in use, as described in this chapter or measured by a sewer meter as may be required by Director of Public Service, and such owner shall be charged the sewer service charge, fixed billing charge, and other applicable charges set forth in  50.22, and other applicable sections plus the following additional charges. 
A.  A charge for a fair and reasonable return on the capital investment the City has made in sewage system facilities which are currently in service and for which users located outside the corporate limits of the City, including master-metered suburban users, did not participate in, in whole or in part and therefore are not now paying or have never paid their allocable share of the capital cost of such sewage system facilities, an additional charge to be determined by the Director of Public Service, on at least an annual basis. Such charge shall be $.057 per one thousand gallons or $.043 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning February 1, 1982; $.057 per one thousand gallons or $.043 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning July 1, 1982, but such charges shall not be applied to bills rendered prior to August 1, 1982; $.069 per one thousand gallons or $.052 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning January 1, 1983, and such charges shall be effective on December 1, 1982, but such charges shall not be applied to bills rendered prior to January 1, 1983; and $.083 per one thousand gallons or $.062 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning January 1, 1984. 
B.  For the cost of collecting and treating excessive unmetered inflow and infiltration as measured or estimated by the Director of Public Service, but excluding master-metered suburban users, an additional charge to be determined by the Director of Public Service, on at least an annual basis. Such charge shall be $.282 per one thousand gallons or $.212 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge beginning February 1, 1982; $.282 per one thousand gallons or $.212 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning July 1, 1982, but such charges shall not be applied to bills rendered prior to August 1, 1982, $.341 per one thousand gallons or $.257 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning January 1, 1983, and such charges shall be effective on December 1, 1982, but such charges shall not be applied to bills rendered prior to January 1, 1983, and $.409 per one thousand gallons or $.308 per one hundred cubic feet of billed discharge for the period beginning January 1, 1984. 
C.  Where a user is being served under an existing agreement which recites that the charge shall be the city rate plus thirty percent, then the city rate shall be the derived amount under  50.22 which shall then be increased by thirty percent, if the thirty percent as applied equals the city rate derived under  50.22 plus subsections A and B of this section, then no further adjustment shall be made; if, however, the thirty percent as applied results in a total charge greater than  50.22 plus subsections A and B of this section, the excess shall nevertheless be charged and shall be credited as an additional fair and reasonable return on capital investment; in the event, the thirty percent as applied results in a total charge less than  50.22 plus subsections A and B of this section, the deficit shall nevertheless be recognized and shall be charged to subsection A of this section also resulting in a fair and reasonable return on capital investment. 
D.  Where users are being served under an existing agreement which is in the nature of a bulk or master-meter agreement with a governmental subdivision which recites a specific formula for determination of the charge, such formula shall continue to be computed. The derived amount from such formula shall then be applied as follows: such derived amount shall first be allocated according to the city rate for master-metered suburban set forth in  50.22; if there is a balance and if the balance equals the amount derived under subsection A of this section then no further adjustment shall be made; if, however, there is a balance and such balance exceeds the amount derived under subsection A of this section, the excess shall nevertheless be charged and shall be credited as an additional fair and reasonable return on capital investment; in the event there is a balance and such balance is less than the amount derived under subsection A of this section, the deficit shall nevertheless, be recognized and shall be charged, also resulting in a fair and reasonable return on capital investment. 
E.  Those users of sewer services whose property is in an area receiving retail sewer service for which there either was never an agreement between governmental subdivisions or where there had been an agreement between governmental subdivisions and which agreement has been terminated shall, effective either July 1, 1982 or the date when applicable because of termination, be subject to this chapter. Therefore, such users shall pay an amount derived from the use charge in  50.22(A) and the billing charge in  50.22(B), which are used for property located in the city, less new OWDA debt (Akron only), plus the charge under subsection A of this section, plus the charge under subsection B of this section, for a subtotal plus a non-agreement area demand charge rate of five percent of aforesaid subtotal resulting in a total to be charged during the time there is no agreement between governmental subdivisions for sewer service charges for such area. 
F.  Those users being served on a wholesale service basis for which there is no existing agreement shall be subject to this article where applicable and shall be charged as follows: The derived amount under  50.22(A) as a master-metered suburban customer plus subsections A and B therein if applicable plus such billing charge as determined by the Director of Public Service and in addition to the foregoing total a nonagreement area demand charge rate of five percent of such foregoing total shall be charged until such time as an agreement for such nonagreement area is executed.

50.24 - Charges exclusive of city water. 
    In the event a lot, parcel of land, building, or premises discharging sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, obtains part or all of the water used from sources other than the Division of Water, which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the Director of Public Service, then, in each such case, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain water meters, satisfactory to the Director, on all supplies other than city water, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewerage charge shall be the sum of the quantities of water measured by all meters. 
50.25 - Exceptions. 
    In the event a lot, parcel of land, building, or premises discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of the amount allowed for a minimum bill per quarter year, and it can be shown, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Service, that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewerage system, then the Director may determine, in such manner and by such method as he may find practicable, the percentage of metered water entering the sanitary sewerage system, or the Director may require or permit the installation of additional meters in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewerage system. The sewerage charge shall be based on the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system subject to the minimum charge provisions set up in  50.22 and 50.23. 
50.26 - New connection charges. 
    For any lot, land, building, or premises from which connection is made with the city sanitary sewerage system or which begins to discharge sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into the city sewerage system either directly or indirectly, the sewerage service charge at the first payment period after the beginning date of sewage discharge into the city sewerage system shall be based on the per diem pro rata amount of the established minimum charge per quarter or shall be based on the water consumed at the established rates, whichever is larger. 
50.27 - Connection to W.P.A. sewers. 
    The Director of Public Service is authorized to collect the sum of one dollar and fifty cents per foot front, in addition to a lateral installation charge of thirty-five dollars from all persons making application for connection to P.W.A.-W.P.A. constructed sewers, such sum to be paid with the filing of the application, except where credit is extended. 
50.28 - Payment schedule. 
    The sewer service fixed billing, and additional charges provided in this chapter shall be payable at least quarterly at the business office designated by the Director of Public Service, and may be made payable at the same time as water bills are payable in the district in which the lot, parcel of land, or premises is located except for additional charges which shall be due as determined by the Director of Public Service. The due date shall be that specified on the statement for such sewerage service and other charges presented to the user of the sewerage system. A penalty equal to ten percent of the total sewer service and other charges shall be added to all bills not paid in full on or before the due date specified on the billing statement. 
(Ord. 1014-1977) 
50.29 - Collections-Authority of service director. 
    The sewerage service charges levied by or pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the Public Utilities Bureau and the Director of Public Service shall make and enforce such bylaws and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe, economical, and efficient management and protection of the city sewerage system, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewerage system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating, and refunding of such charges. 
50.30 - Delinquent charges and liens. 
    Each sewerage service charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter is made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land, or premises served by a connection to the sanitary sewerage system of the city, and if the same is not paid within thirty days after it is due and payable, it shall be certified to the County Auditor who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the county with the interest and penalties allowed by law and it shall be collected as other taxes are collected.

50.33 - Surcharges for extra strength waste-Credits for below-strength waste. 
A.  For the purpose of this section, and any other applicable section of Chapter 50, the assigned sewage strength for each user class is as follows: 
Assigned Sewage 
Strength B.O.D. (mg/l) S.S. (mg/l) Residential User 182 290 Commercial User 289 572 Industrial User 399 771 Master-Metered Suburban User 182 290  
1.  Sewage or industrial wastes above the assigned sewage strength for each user class but acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system shall be subject to a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or both of two constituents of the water or wastes: 
a.  Total suspended solids; and/or 
b.  Five-day B.O.D. at twenty degrees Celsius and as herein provided. 
2.  When either or both the total suspended solids and the B.O.D. of a water or waste accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of their assigned strengths, the excess concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows: 
a.  Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.201/lb. = S.S. surcharge per day effective January 1, 2010. 
b.  Pounds of excess B.O.D. per day x $0.237/lb. = B.O.D. surcharge per day effective January 1, 2010. 
3.  In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the sewer service and other charges as defined in Sections 50.22 and 50.23 on the entire volume of sewage discharged to the sewerage system. 
B.  Sewage or industrial wastes below the assigned sewage strength for master meter suburban users and acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system shall be subject to a credit. The credit shall be determined on the basis of either or both of two constituents of the water or wastes: total suspended solids; and/or five-day B.O.D. at twenty degrees Celsius as herein provided. 
1.  When either or both of the total suspended solids and the B.O.D. of water or waste accepted for admission to the system from a master meter suburban user is less than the values of their assigned strengths, the short fall of concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall be subject to a credit as follows: 
a.  Pounds of short fall of suspended solids x $0.201/lb. = S.S. credit effective January 1, 2010. 
b.  Pounds of short fall of B.O.D. x $0.237/lb. = B.O.D. credit effective January 1, 2010. 
2.  Master meter users eligible for the above credit will pay the sewer service and other charges as defined in Sections 50.22 and 50.23 on the entire volume of sewage discharged to the sewerage system. 
C.  The pounds of B.O.D. and/or pounds of suspended solids above assigned concentrations for each user class that are discharged to the sewerage system, and the pounds B.O.D. and/or pounds of suspended solids below the assigned concentrations for master meter suburban users that are discharged to the sewerage system, shall be determined by the Director, Department of Public Service, on a continuing basis as required. 
D.  In addition to a surcharge on B.O.D. and suspended solids, the city shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other pollutant into the sewerage system for any other reason that it deems necessary and appropriate and which discharge or pollutant or other reason results in additional costs not covered in the charges under Sections 50.22, 50.23, and this section or other applicable sections in this chapter.

(Ord. No. 542-2009,  5, 12-21-09) 
50.34 - Pretreatment credit. 
A.  In the event that a commercial or industrial user discharges waste into the sewage system at concentrations of B.O.D. and S.S. which are less than the assigned strength for the commercial or industrial user class or elects to pretreat their volume of sewage or industrial waste that is discharged to the sewage system such that the concentration of B.O.D. and S.S. in the wastewater discharged is less than the assigned concentrations for each user class as stated in this chapter, then such user can apply to the Director of Public Service for a credit for the difference between the actual load discharged and the assigned load. The credit shall be equal to the surcharge rate per pound as stated in this section times the difference in pounds of B.O.D. or S.S. No credit will be given for discharges less than or removal of B.O.D. and S.S. below the concentrations of that which is considered to be the strength of normal domestic waste (the assigned strength for the residential user class). 
B.  Commercial and industrial users of the sewage system who apply for a credit must present evidence to the Director of Public Service verifying the actual concentration of B.O.D. and S.S. in the wastewater they are discharging to the sewage system. Evidence shall generally mean the results of analysis of periodic twenty-four hour fifteen-minute interval composite samples taken frequently enough so as to give a representative analysis of the waste load being discharged to the sewage system on a year-round basis. Composite sampling must be performed on the wastewater before it enters the sewage system and at all points where wastewater discharges enter the sewage system. Tests, measurements, and analysis of composite samples shall be performed in accordance with  50.49 and at the expense of the user. 
C.  No credit for the difference between actual loads and assigned loads will be given to users of the sewage system who obtain all or part of the water supply which makes up their total wastewater discharge from sources other than water purchased from the city unless evidence is presented to the Director of Public Service verifying the actual volume of wastewater being discharged to the sewage system. Such evidence shall generally mean the results of measurements made by sewage flow meters installed in discharge lines at all points where wastewater discharged by the user enters the sewage system. Sewage flow meters must be of the type approved by the Director of Public Service and installed, operated, and maintained on a daily basis by the user and at the user's expense. 
D.  Where it is not practical or possible to install sewage flow meters, the Director of Public Service may, at his option, estimate the total volume of wastewater being discharged to the sewage system by other methods, such as those stated in  50.24. 
(Ord. 662-1978; Ord. 1014-1977) 
50.35 - Industrial cost recovery. 
A.  The city establishes an industrial cost recovery system as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and in accordance with Federal Regulation 40 CFR 35.928. The purpose of the industrial cost recovery system is to recover from industrial users all federal funds that are used to construct sewage treatment facilities that serve the industrial user class. 
1.  A special industrial cost recovery fund is established and all industrial cost recovery amounts collected by the city shall be deposited and maintained in this special fund. Payments for industrial cost recovery shall be made by industrial users no less often than annually. The first payment by an industrial user shall be made not later than one year after such user begins use of the treatment works. 
2.  An industrial user's share shall be based on all factors which significantly influence the cost of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included to insure a proportional distribution of the grant assistance allocable to industrial use to all industrial users of the treatment works. As a minimum, an industry's share shall be proportional to its flow, in relation to treatment works flow capacity. 
3.  If there is a substantial change in the strength, volume, or delivery flow rate characteristics introduced into the treatment works by an industrial user, such user's share shall be adjusted accordingly. 
4.  If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works, each existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted accordingly. 
5.  An industrial user's share shall include only that portion of the grant assistance allocable to its use or to capacity firmly committed for its use. 
6.  An industrial user's share shall not include an interest component. 
7.  The city shall retain fifty percent of the amounts recovered from industrial users. The remainder, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the U.S. Treasury on an annual basis. A minimum of eighty percent of the retained amounts, together with interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for the allowable costs of the expansion or reconstruction of treatment works. 
8.  The city shall obtain the written approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regional Administrator prior to commitment of the retained amounts for any expansion and reconstruction. The remainder of the retained amounts may be used as Council shall determine. 
B.  The industrial cost recovery rates for all grants subject to industrial cost recovery regulations that have been awarded or pending award as of January 1, 1978 are as follows: 
(1) Total Recovery Amount I.C.R. Unit Charge I.C.R. Rate Per Unit of Billed Discharge at Assigned Loadings $/1000 Gal. $/100 Cu.

2.  The exact procedure used to compute the industrial cost recovery payments for the existing industrial users and a method of accounting for such payments is shown in detail in a report prepared for the city and titled User Charges and Industrial Cost Recovery dated along with all other industrial cost recovery documents for the duration of the industrial cost recovery period. 
(Ord. 1014-1977) 
50.36 - Annual review. 
    The sewer service charge, fixed billing charge, user charges, and other charges shall be reviewed annually by the Director of Public Service, of the city as specifically mentioned hereinbefore, in order to determine whether or not they are individually sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization costs, annual cost of operation, maintenance of the sewerage system, and all other applicable costs. If the difference between the total annual revenue derived and the total annual costs is sufficient to justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service charge, fixed billing charge, user charges, or other charges, the city shall adjust the rates as required. The annual review shall maintain a proportional user charge and industrial cost recovery system in addition to revising the other charges set forth in this article. 
(Ord. 1014-1977)

50.44 - Purpose and policy. 
A.  This article sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the City's wastewater collection and treatment system, and enables the city to protect public health in conformity with all applicable local, state and federal laws related thereto. 
B.  The objectives of this article are: 
1.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City's wastewater system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system, safety of the employees or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge; 
2.  To prevent the introduction of the type and quality of pollutants into the City's wastewater system which do not receive adequate treatment in the water pollution control station, and which will pass through all or a portion of the system or bypass the system into the navigable waters of the United States or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system. The type and quality of pollutants discharged into the City's wastewater system or storm water system shall not cause a degradation of the quality of the receiving waters and/or violation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the city by Ohio EPA as a primacy state for USEPA; 
3.  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system; 
4.  To satisfy the state and federal requirements that the city develop and implement an industrial waste control program in compliance with the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations for New and Existing Sources, 40 CFR Part 403. Further, this article shall satisfy the state and federal requirements that the city develop and implement a Storm Water Quality Management Program in accordance with the Water Quality Act of 1987, 40 CFR Part 402(P). 
5.  To provide a procedure by which the city can enforce the elimination, up to the specified storm event design, of separate sanitary sewer overflows, elimination of dry weather combined sewer overflows, reduction and control of wet weather combined sewer overflows in community sewer systems and control peak flows from community sewer systems at the point of connection into sewers owned by the city or another community. 
C.  This article provides for the regulation of discharges into the City's wastewater system and storm water system through the issuance of permits and the enforcement of administrative regulations. This article does not provide for the recovery of operations, maintenance or replacement costs of the Water Pollution Control Station or other costs associated with the construction of collection and treatment systems used by industrial dischargers, in proportion to their use of the Water Pollution Control Station, which are the subject of separate enactments.

    The city shall evaluate the completed application and data furnished by the discharger and may require at that time additional information. Upon review the city may issue a wastewater discharge permit. 
C.  Permit Modifications. 
1.  The city reserves the right to amend any wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the city with applicable laws and regulations. All national categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the promulgation of this subchapter shall without further action by the city become part of this subchapter upon their effective date. A discharger with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the city within one hundred eighty days after the promulgation of an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, the amended information required by  50.52 and 50.53. New source dischargers shall submit to the city at least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge the amended information required by  50.52 and 50.53. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in this permit at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change in such permit. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
2.  The Service Director may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an SIU, determine that a noncategorical industrial user is not a significant industrial user if the industrial user has no reasonable potential to adversely affect the POTW's operation in the opinion of the city or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement. 
D.  Permit Duration. New and modified wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specific time period, not to exceed five years. The discharger shall apply for permit re-issuance a minimum of one hundred eighty days prior to the expiration of the existing permit. 
E.  Compliance Schedules. 
1.  Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this subchapter, the discharger shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional operational and maintenance activities. The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this subchapter or categorical pretreatment standard including, but not limited to, dates relating to hiring an engineer, hiring other appropriate personnel, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, start-up of operations, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this subchapter. 
2.  Upon completing final plans all required permits shall be obtained by the discharger. If required by Ohio EPA a permit to install shall be obtained by the discharger prior to construction. Final plans shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger and certified to by a qualified engineer who is a licensed professional. 
3.  Under no circumstances shall the city permit a time increment in the compliance schedule for any single step directed toward compliance, which exceeds nine months. 
4.  Not later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a progress report to the city, including no less than a statement as to whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
(Ord. 412-2012) 
50.54 - Reporting requirements. 
A.  Compliance Data Report. Within ninety days following the date for final compliance by the SIU with applicable pretreatment standards set forth in this subchapter or ninety days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the sewerage system by a new discharger, any discharger subject to this subchapter shall submit to the city a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. In cases where the wastewater discharge permit requires compliance with a best management practice, the discharger must submit documentation required by the Service Director or the wastewater discharge permit necessary to determine the compliance status of the discharger. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, and shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
1.  For dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Service Director in accordance with the procedures in  50.47, the compliance data report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
B.  Periodic Compliance Reports. All SIUs shall submit periodic compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in their discharge. The frequencies of monitoring and reporting and the pollutants to be analyzed shall be prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. When 40 CFR 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques, or the techniques are inappropriate, alternative methods may be approved by the city. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The city, for good cause, considering those factors such as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating factors, may require the submission of the reports on months other than those specified above. In cases where the wastewater discharge permit requires compliance with a best management practice, the SIU must submit documentation required by the Service Director or the wastewater discharge permit necessary to determine the compliance status of the SIU. The periodic compliance report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
1.  Except for in the case of centralized waste treatment facilities regulated by and defined in 40 CFR 437, the Service Director may authorize a SIU subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the SIU has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the SIU. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(i)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(ii)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The SIU must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(iii)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the SIU must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's processed wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(iv)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(v)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the U.S. EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(vi)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Service Director must be included as a condition in the SIU's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the SIU in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Service Director for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
(vii)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the SIU's permit by the Service Director, the SIU must certify on each report the following statement, establishing that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the SIU: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standards under 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard part or parts], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant or pollutants] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since submittal of the last periodic report under paragraph (E) of Rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code." 
(viii)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the SIU's operations, the SIU must immediately notify the Service Director in writing and start monitoring that pollutant at the frequency specified by the applicable pretreatment standard. 
(ix)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(x)  This waiver applies only to SIU self-monitoring and does not remove the Service Director's obligation to monitor for the parameter. However, this waiver can be extended to monitoring completed by the Service Director in order to satisfy SIU self-monitoring. 
C.  If sampling performed by any significant industrial user (SIU) indicates a violation, the significant industrial user (SIU) shall notify the city within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The discharger shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted by the Service Director in lieu of the SIU, the Service Director shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the violation unless it notifies the SIU of the violation and requires the SIU to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. If a categorical discharger monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in 40 CFR 403.12, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the periodic compliance report. 
D.  All dischargers shall notify the city in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(P). 
E.  Except as indicated in sections (F) and (G) below, the discharger must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Service Director and such authorization is documented in the user's file. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Service Director, the samples must be representatives of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate U.S. EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: 
1.  For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
2.  For volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. 
3.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved U.S. EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Service Director, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
F.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, ph, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
G.  For sampling required in support of periodic compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Service Director may authorize a lower minimum.

(Ord. 412-2012) 
50.55 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  Each person or governmental entity applying for a wastewater discharge permit, including dischargers to the municipal separate storm sewer system, so directed by the city shall provide and operate, at the discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises. Except where a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing the facility is located so it will not be obstructed by landscaping, utilities, parked vehicles and shall be accessible at all times. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days, unless specified otherwise by the city, of receipt of written notice from the city directing the discharger to construct the facilities. 
B.  All dischargers, if directed by the Service Director, shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of no less than twenty-four inches diameter and an internal diameter of no less than forty-eight inches containing such flow measuring, recording, and sampling equipment as may be required by the city to ensure compliance with this subchapter. Such structure may be utilized by the discharger for his monitoring program if approved by the city. The discharger shall obtain all required permits prior to construction of monitoring facilities. 
C.  The Service Director may require a discharger to install flow monitoring facilities, instruments and recording devices to ensure accurate measurement of flows as the Service Director determines to be necessary. 
(Ord. 443-1994; Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985)

50.56 - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city may inspect the facilities of any discharger or storm water discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of the codified ordinances. The discharger or storm water discharger shall allow the city or its representatives, without prior notice, upon presentation of credentials of identification, to enter upon the premises of the discharger or storm water discharger at all hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, observation, measurement, testing, records examination, or in the performance of any of their duties. Delays in permitting access by city personnel in excess of ten minutes shall be considered a violation of the wastewater discharge or storm water discharger's permit(s) and this article subject to notification of a violation of  50.62. The city shall have the right to set up on the discharger's or storm water discharger's property necessary devices to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering operations, or all of these. The city shall have the right to copy the discharger's or storm water discharger's records relevant to determining compliance with the requirements of the codified ordinances. This includes discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system and related storm water permits, best management practice plans (BMP plans), pollution prevention plans, annual monitoring results and all other storm water related permit requirements. 
(Ord. 443-1994; Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.57 - Confidential information. 
    Information and data furnished to the city with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other government agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city the release of such information would divulge information, processes and methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger. When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for use related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit, the pretreatment programs, or all of these, provided however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any party except as provided herein and unless a ten-day notification is given to the discharger. 
(Ord. 173-1991) 
50.58 - Enforcement management system. 
    The city shall develop an enforcement management system to provide consistent and fair enforcement responses to instances of noncompliance. The system must contain an enforcement response plan including time frames and procedures. The Service Director shall develop the system and evaluate and revise as required. Findings shall be reported to City Council at least annually.

A.  Violation (first level enforcement). Whenever the city finds that any discharger has violated its wastewater discharge permit or this article, the Service Director shall serve verbal or written notice stating the nature of the alleged violation and the amount of charges and fees per  50.58. No later than thirty days after the notification the discharger shall respond personally or in writing advising the city of its position. Thereafter, the parties shall meet, if required, to establish a plan for correction in the form of an order or compliance schedule. When a violation is not corrected in a timely manner the Service Director may order the discharger to pay an administrative fine and appear at an administrative adjustment hearing. 
B.  Administrative Adjustment Hearing (second level enforcement). Whenever the city finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies revocation of a wastewater discharge permit, pursuant to  50.60, the Service Director shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation and the amount of the administrative fine. Within thirty days of the date of receipt of the notice, the industrial discharger shall respond personally or in writing, advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof in the form of a consent order. The administrative adjustment hearing shall be officiated by the Public Utilities Bureau Manager or his authorized representative. Failure to comply with a consent order is a violation of this section and warrants escalation to a show cause hearing. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.63 - Show cause hearing (third level enforcement). 
    Where the violation of  50.61 hereof is not corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment hearing, the Service Director may order any discharger which causes or allows conduct prohibited by  50.62 hereof, to show cause before him or his duly authorized representative, why the proposed permit revocation action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, the amount of the administrative fine, not to exceed five thousand dollars for each violation, and directing the discharger to show cause before the city or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the city which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. The orders may be in the form of a compliance order or a cease and desist order. Appeal of those orders and administrative fine may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable state law. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.64 - Judicial proceedings. 
    Following the entry of any order by the city with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of this section, the Law Director for the city may, following the authorization of such action by the city, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate courts. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.65 - Right of appeal. 
    Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the city or any matter covered by this article and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this article or deals with a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply with the exception of emergency suspension of service under  50.59. Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this article may be taken in accordance with applicable state law. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.66 - Operating upsets. 
A.  Any discharger which experiences an upset in operation or bypass which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with the wastewater discharge permit or the codified ordinances shall inform the city thereof immediately upon first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where the information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger with the city within five days. The report shall specify: 
1.  Description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact on a discharger's compliance status; 
2.  Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which the compliance is reasonably expected to occur; and 
3.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an upset for other conditions of noncompliance. 
B.  When it can be demonstrated that circumstances would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule imposed by the codified ordinances, a request for extension of time may be presented for consideration by the city. 
C.  Failure to report an upset or bypass, and failure to report within the prescribed time period shall give cause for charges and fees per  50.59. 
D.  Notification of an upset or bypass does not preclude or prevent enforcement action by the city. Penalty, see  50.99. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.67 - Other remedies. 
    Notwithstanding any other enforcement procedure listed in the codified ordinances, whenever it is determined there is a substantial danger to the public health or welfare or a substantial danger to the environment or of interfering with the POTW due to the acts or omissions of any discharger, the city may, through its appropriate officials, seek a temporary restraining order, temporary permanent injunction or abatement in the court of common pleas and shall not be required under these conditions to exhaust the administrative procedures within the codified ordinances as a condition precedent to the commencement of that action. 
(Ord. 173-1991; Ord. 546-1985) 
50.68 - Annual publication. 
    Annually the Service Director shall publish a list of all dischargers or significant industrial users which at any time during the previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all SIUs (or any other discharger that violates paragraphs (C), (D), or (H) of this section). For the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the following criteria; 
A.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit, the average limit, or the instantaneous limit for the same pollutant parameter; 
B.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit, the instantaneous limit, or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
C.  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum, longer term average, instantaneous limit or narrative standard) that the Service Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
D.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
E.  Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
F.  Failure to provide, within forty-five days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
G.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; 
H.  Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the Service Director determines will or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of the City's pretreatment program.

53.03 - Procedure. 
    The procedures as set forth in this section are those applicable to special assessments for public improvements, except those undertaken pursuant to R.C. Chapter 729. 
A.  Prior to the consideration of any resolution of necessity providing for a public improvement, plans, specifications and profiles of the proposed improvement, and an estimate of the cost of the improvement shall be prepared by the City Engineer and filed in the office of the Clerk of Council and shall remain open to the inspection of all interested persons. Those plans, specifications and profiles shall conform to the requirements of R.C. Chapter 727. Generally, the plans shall be sufficient to show the locations of the streets or other public property to be improved and the specifications shall be sufficient to describe the improvement to be made. 
B.  1.  After those plans, specifications, profiles and estimate of cost have been so filed, Council may declare the necessity of the improvement by resolution. The resolution of necessity shall conform to the requirements of R.C. Chapter 727; provided, that Council may make the same determination in the resolution of necessity with regard to improving streets and other public property by providing street cleaning services as is provided in R.C.  727.09 for other types of improvements. The resolution of necessity shall be published as other resolutions. 
2.  The resolution of necessity may also provide for the appointment of an Assessment Equalization Board to hear objections of property owners to the estimated assessments. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the Assessment Equalization Board shall consist of three disinterested persons selected by the Clerk of Council from the Assessment Equalization Board member list. The Assessment Equalization Board member list shall consist of at least twelve freeholders of the city previously appointed by Council, on an annual basis or more frequently if determined necessary and appropriate by Council, and shall be maintained on file in the Office of the Clerk of Council. The resolution of necessity shall provide that the Clerk of Council shall fix the time and place for the hearing by the Assessment Equalization Board on such objections and shall notify persons so objecting of the time and place of such hearing in accordance with R.C.  727.16. Notwithstanding these provisions, Council may appoint an Assessment Equalization Board by separate resolution as set forth in R.C.  727.16. 
C.  The City Assessor shall prepare the estimated special assessments for the improvement and file them as required by R.C. Chapter 727. Notice of the adoption of the resolution of necessity and the filing of the estimated special assessments shall be given to affected property owners in accordance with R.C.  727.13; provided, that the notice of the adoption of the resolution of necessity and the filing of the estimated special assessments for the improvement of streets and other public property by providing lighting or by providing street cleaning services for property owners with estimated special assessments of five hundred dollars or less shall be given by publication in accordance with R.C.  727.14. Publication of those notices may be made in conjunction with, and may incorporate as part of those notices, the resolution of necessity required to be published pursuant to subsection B of this section. Publication of those notices with the resolution of necessity shall constitute the publication of that resolution. Notice of the adoption of the resolution of necessity and the filing of the estimated special assessments for the improvement of streets and other public property by providing lighting or by providing street cleaning services for property owners with estimated special assessments of greater than five hundred dollars shall be given in accordance with R.C.  727.13. 
D.  Proceedings for the hearing of objections of property owners to the estimated special assessments and the equalization thereof shall be taken as prescribed herein and by R.C. Chapter 727; provided, that objections of property owners to the estimated special assessments for street lighting or street cleaning services and the equalization thereof shall, as provided in the resolution of necessity or otherwise by Council, be heard by an Assessment Equalization Board consisting of: 
1.  The Director of Law, or a Deputy or Assistant Director of Law as designated by the Director of Law; 
2.  The Director of Finance, an Assistant Director of Finance or other official of the Department of Finance as designated by the Director of Finance; 
3.  The Director of Public Service, or a Deputy Director of Public Service as designated by the Director of Public Service; 
4.  The Deputy Mayor of Administration or other Deputy Mayor or other city official as designated by the Mayor; and 
5.  A citizen of the City of Akron selected by the Clerk of Council from the Assessment Equalization Board member list or as otherwise designated by Council. 
E.  Council shall determine to proceed with an improvement as provided by R.C. Chapter 727. This ordinance to proceed may include confirmation and ratification by Council of the Assessment Equalization Board established in accordance with subsection B of this section and approval by Council of the report of that Assessment Equalization Board. 
F.  After the completion of any public improvement and after the actual cost of the improvement has been ascertained, the City Assessor shall prepare a final special assessment list showing the amount of the special assessment against each lot or parcel of land to be assessed as shown on the estimated special assessment list and reflecting the actual cost of the improvement. To the extent the rate or amount of the special assessment is not established in the resolution of necessity and to the extent consistent with the uniform special assessment rates established in this chapter, the final special assessment shall be increased or decreased in the same proportion to the estimated special assessment as the actual cost of the improvement bears to the estimated cost of the improvement upon which the estimated special assessments were based. The final special assessment list shall also take into account the report of any assessment equalization board approved by Council in connection with the improvement. The final special assessment list for improvements or projects that include pavement shall be adjusted by the City Assessor to provide credit to affected property owners for, or in an amount equal to, any remaining special assessments against those properties for micropaving. The final special assessment list shall be filed with the Clerk of Council and the City Assessor and a copy thereof shall be retained by the City Engineer. 
G.  After the special assessment list has been filed with the Clerk of Council, Council may enact an ordinance levying the special assessments in accordance with R.C. Chapter 727. Upon the expiration of the cash payment period, if any, specified in that ordinance, the special assessments shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection in the manner provided by law. 
H.  After the enactment of the ordinance levying the special assessments, the City Assessor shall publish notice of that enactment in accordance with R.C. Chapter 727. For those improvements having a life usefulness of five years or more, the City Assessor shall mail notice letters to the owners of property to whom notice of the passage of the resolution of necessity and filing of estimated special assessments was given pursuant to subsection C of this section. The notice letters shall be addressed to the owners at the same address at which service of such prior notice was made or to which such prior notice was mailed. No notice letters shall be mailed to any owner to whom such prior notice was published. The notice letters shall be mailed within ten days after enactment of the ordinance levying the special assessments. The notice letters shall: 
1.  Advise owners of their option to pay in cash the special assessments levied by the ordinance, if they so desire, 
2.  If applicable to the improvement, provide information concerning the request for waiver for owners in treatment areas in accordance with  53.08, and 
3.  Notify owners of the availability of the method of paying the special assessments as provided in  53.09 and that the necessary forms to make application for such method may be obtained from the office of the City Assessor.

53.06 - Corner and L-shaped lots. 
A.  In the case of an improvement wherein the short side of a corner lot bounds and abuts upon the street to be improved or Council determines that such lot is benefited by the improvement, for the improvements described in  53.04, there shall be assessed an amount computed in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05, provided that this shall not apply to sidewalks and curbs constructed or repaired in accordance with proceedings undertaken pursuant to R.C. Chapter 729. 
B.  In the case of an improvement wherein the long side of a corner lot bounds and abuts upon the street to be improved or Council determines that such lot is benefited by the improvement, the following is determined to be in proportion to the benefits that may result from the improvement: 
1.  For the improvements described in  53.04(A)(1), (2), (3), (17), (18), (19) and (22) there shall be assessed on the first two hundred feet of such long side, twenty-five percent of the amount that would otherwise have been assessed in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05, and on the remaining length of such long side, the amount assessed in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05. This shall not apply to sidewalks or curbs constructed or repaired in accordance with proceedings undertaken pursuant to R.C. Chapter 729. 
2.  For the improvements described in  53.04(A)(6), (7), (8), (10) and (11), if the corner lot is benefited by these types of improvements on its short side, no special assessment shall be levied on the first two hundred feet of such long side, and on the remaining length of such long side, the special assessments shall be levied in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05, and if the corner lot is not so benefited on its short side, the special assessments shall be levied in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05 on the number of feet of such long side that is equal to the number of feet of the short side of that corner lot plus the number of feet of such long side that exceeds two hundred feet. 
3.  For the improvements described in  53.04(A)(4)(5), (9), (12), (13) and (14), the special assessments shall be levied in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05. 
C.  For the purposes of this section only, a lot with frontage on two or more separate streets shall be treated as a corner lot. In the case of an improvement where a lot has equal frontage on separate streets, the frontage on the street which is or would be the property's street address shall be considered the short side. 
D.  For the improvements described in  53.04(A) (1), (2), (3), (17), (18), (19) and (22), the long side of an L-shaped lot shall be assessed at twenty-five percent of the frontage rate for the first two hundred feet and one hundred percent of the frontage rate for any frontage over two hundred feet.

The method of levying and apportioning the special assessments for pedestrian walkways against benefited property shall be prescribed in the resolution of necessity providing for that improvement and the estimated special assessments for the improvement shall be approved by Council. Property bounding and abutting on a pedestrian walkway or otherwise benefiting therefrom may be required to connect to the pedestrian walkway as determined by Council. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to the construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance of sidewalks as defined in  53.01. 
(Ord. 122-1988; Ord. 109-1986)

Chapter 729 upon the benefited properties located in treatment areas that are owned at the time the ordinance levying the special assessments is enacted by persons whose income falls below fifty percent of the median income for the Akron area, as reported from time to time by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census; provided that those owners deliver to the City Assessor within twenty days after the enactment of the ordinance levying the special assessments a signed request that the special assessments be paid from the federal funds together with proper documentation as to income level. For all other properties in the treatment areas, the special assessment rate shall be the same as would be levied on these properties in accordance with  53.04 and 53.05 and R.C. Chapter 729, provided that the applicable rate for improvements, other than those improvements for which a petition as defined in  53.01 has been submitted, will be determined for each resolution of necessity according to the rates established by the first resolution of necessity passed for improvements in the particular treatment area pursuant to the plan established for the treatment area. Except as provided herein, all other provisions of this chapter apply to the special assessments for improvements against the properties in the treatment areas.

B.  The application must be on a form approved by the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance may establish credit and financial criteria to determine eligibility of a property owner for the program and may establish a committee of City officials and employees to assist her in reviewing applications and determining eligibility. The Director of Finance may require a property owner to disclose certain financial information in order to aid the Director of Finance in determining the eligibility of the property owner to participate in the program.

The agreement will constitute a petition for all purposes of Chapter 53, including without limitation,  53.02(B). The agreement may provide that additional assessments will include interest at the rate borne by any securities issued to provide business assistance to properties benefited by a designated improvement or, if no such securities are issued, at a rate determined by Council.

The notice of enactment of a resolution of necessity that is required to be published will not include information as to the amount of business assistance available, but it will include a statement that a public improvement has been designated as a designated improvement. 
4.  A property owner may apply to participate in the program at any time before the ordinance levying the assessments is enacted under  53.03(G). 
5.  The final special assessment list prepared by the City Assessor under  53.03(F) must include the amount of all additional assessments, but the additional assessments will not be increased or decreased in proportion to changes in the cost of the designated improvement. 
6.  Additional assessments may be paid in cash in the same manner as standard Assessments. If not paid in cash, they will be certified to the County Fiscal Officer for collection in the manner set forth in the ordinance levying the assessments enacted under  53.03(G).

At the initial appearance, the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf may file a motion requesting the Court to order that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. Except as provided in this subsection or subsection (C)(2)(B) of this section, if such a motion is filed, the Court, at the conclusion of the initial appearance and in its discretion, may issue an order requiring that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant: If the arrested person is not the vehicle owner and the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf is not present at the arrested person's initial appearance, if the arrested person does not plead guilty or no contest to the violation of subsections (B)(1) and (D)(2) of  4507.02 of the Revised Code, a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or  4507.33 of the Revised Code with which he is charged, if the charge that the arrested person committed that violation is not dismissed at the arrested person's initial appearance, and if the Court believes that the vehicle owner was not provided adequate notice of the initial appearance, the Court, in its discretion, may allow the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf to file a motion, at any time after the arrested person's initial appearance and before the final disposition of the charge against the arrested person, requesting the Court to order that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. Upon the filing of such a motion, the Court, in its discretion, may issue an order requiring that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. If the Court allows the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf to file such a motion after the arrested person's initial appearance, the extra time granted by the Court does not extend the time within which the initial appearance must be conducted and the Court shall proceed with all other aspects of the initial appearance in accordance with its normal procedures. 
    If, in any case, the Court issues an order returning or releasing the vehicle and its identification license plates to the movant, the order shall indicate that the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf shall bring the vehicle and its identification license plates to the Court on the day on which the charges against the arrested person are to be resolved and that, if the arrested person is convicted of or pleads guilty to the violation of subsection (B)(1) or (D)(2) of  4507.02 of the Revised Code, a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or  4507.33 of the Revised Code with which he is charged, the court, subject to  4503.235 [4503.23.5] of the Revised Code, will issue an order for the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates under  4503.233 [4503.23.3] and  4507.361 [4507.36.1] of 4507.99 of the Revised Code or for the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle under  4503.234 [4503.23.4] and  4507.361 [4507.36.1] or 4507.99 of the Revised Code. If the Court issues an order for the return or release of a vehicle and its identification license plates under this subsection, the order shall be given to the movant. If the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf presents the order for the return or release of the vehicle and license plates to the law enforcement agency that towed and is keeping the vehicle or that immobilized the vehicle, the agency promptly shall return or release the vehicle and its identification license plates to the person presenting the order. 
b.  If, at the initial appearance, the arrested person pleads guilty to the violation of subsection (B)(1) or (D)(2) of  4507.02 of the Revised Code, a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or  4507.33 of the Revised Code or pleads no contest to and is convicted of the violation, the Court shall impose sentence upon the arrested person as provided in this subsection and subject to  4503.235 [4503.23.5] of the Revised Code, shall order the immobilization of the vehicle he was operating at the time of, or that was involved in, the offense and the impoundment of its license plates under  4503.233 [4503.23.3] and  4507.361 [4507.36.1] or 4507.99 of the Revised Code or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle under  4503.234 [4503.23.4] and  4507.361 [4507.36.1] or 4507.99 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable; and the vehicle and its identification license plates shall not be returned or released to the vehicle owner under subsection (C)(2)(A) of this section. If the arrested person is not the vehicle owner and the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf is not present at the arrested person's initial appearance and if the Court believes that the vehicle owner was not provided adequate notice of the initial appearance, the Court, in its discretion, may refrain for a reasonable period of time from ordering the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its identification license plates or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle so that the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf may appear before the Court to present evidence as to why the Court should not order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle. If the Court refrains from ordering the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle,  4503.235 [4503.23.5] of the Revised Code applies relative to the order of immobilization and impoundment or the order of forfeiture.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the officer shall seize the vehicle and license plates under this subsection regardless of whether the vehicle is registered in the name of the person who was operating it or in the name of another person. This section does not apply to or affect any rented or leased vehicle that is being rented or leased for a period of thirty days or less, except that a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer who makes an arrest of a type that is described in subsection (B)(1) of this section and that involves a rented or leased vehicle of this type shall notify, within twenty-four hours after the officer makes the arrest, the renter or lessor of the vehicle regarding the circumstances of the arrest and the location at which the vehicle may be picked up. At the time of the seizure of the vehicle, the law enforcement officer who made the arrest shall give the vehicle operator written notice that the vehicle and its identification license plates have been seized; that the vehicle either will be kept by the officer's law enforcement agency or will be immobilized at least until the operator's initial appearance on the charge of the offense for which the arrest was made; that, at the initial appearance, the Court in certain circumstances may order that the vehicle and license plates be returned or released to the vehicle owner until the disposition of that charge; that, if the vehicle operator is convicted of that charge, the Court generally must order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the forfeiture of the vehicle; and that, if the operator is not the vehicle owner, the operator immediately should inform the vehicle owner that the vehicle and its license plates have been seized and that he may be able to obtain their return or release at the initial appearance. 
2.  A law enforcement officer of the agency that employs the arresting officer shall give written notice of the seizure to the Court that will conduct the initial appearance of the vehicle operator on the charges against him arising out of the arrest. The notice shall be given when the charges are filed against the vehicle operator. Upon receipt of the notice, the Court promptly shall determine whether the vehicle operator is the vehicle owner and, if it determines that the vehicle operator is not the vehicle owner, promptly shall send or deliver written notice of the seizure to the vehicle owner. The written notice to the vehicle owner shall contain all the information required by subsection (B)(1) of this section to be in a notice to be given to the vehicle operator and also shall specify the date, time, and place of the vehicle operator's initial appearance on the charges against him arising out of the arrest.

C.  1.  A vehicle that is seized and towed under subsection B of this section shall be safely kept at the place to which it is ordered towed by the law enforcement agency that employs the arresting officer until the initial appearance of the vehicle operator relative to the charge that he violated  4511.19 of the Revised Code or the municipal OMVI ordinance. A vehicle that is seized and immobilized under subsection B of this section shall remain immobilized until the initial appearance of the vehicle operator relative to the charge in question. In either case, the identification license plates of the vehicle that are removed pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be safely kept by the law enforcement agency that employs the arresting officer until the initial appearance of the vehicle operator relative to the charge in question. The initial appearance shall be held within five days from the date of the person's arrest that resulted in the seizure of the vehicle. 
2.  A. At the initial appearance, the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf may file a motion requesting the Court to order that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. Except as provided in this subsection or subsection (C)(2)(B) of this section, if such a motion is filed, the Court, at the conclusion of the initial appearance and in its discretion, may issue an order requiring that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. If the vehicle operator is not the vehicle owner and the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf is not present at the vehicle operator's initial appearance, if the vehicle operator does not plead guilty or no contest to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or the municipal OMVI ordinance with which he is charged, if the charge that the vehicle operator committed that violation is not dismissed at the vehicle operator's initial appearance, and if the Court believes that the vehicle owner was not provided adequate notice of the initial appearance, the Court, in its discretion, may allow the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf to file a motion, at any time after the vehicle operator's initial appearance and before the final disposition of the charge against the vehicle operator, requesting the Court to order that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. Upon the filing of such a motion, the Court, in its discretion, may issue an order requiring that the vehicle and its identification license plates be returned or released to the movant. If the Court allows the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf to file such a motion after the vehicle operator's initial appearance, the extra time granted by the Court does not extend the time within which the initial appearance must be conducted and the Court shall proceed with all other aspects of the initial appearance in accordance with its normal procedures. 
    If, in any case, the Court issues an order returning the vehicle and its identification license plates to the movant, the order shall indicate that the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf shall bring the vehicle and its identification license plates to the Court on the day on which the charges against the vehicle operator are to be resolved and that, if the vehicle operator are to be resolved and that, if the vehicle operator is convicted of or pleads guilty to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or municipal OMVI ordinance with which he is charged, the Court, subject to  4503.235 of the Revised Code, will issue an order for the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates under  4503.233 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or for the criminal forfeiture to the state of the vehicle under  4503.234 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance. If the Court issues an order for the return or release of a vehicle and its identification license plates under this subsection, the order shall be given to the movant. If the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf presents the order for the return or release of the vehicle and license plates to the law enforcement agency that towed and is keeping the vehicle or that immobilized the vehicle, the agency promptly shall return or release the vehicle and its identification license plates to the person presenting the order. 
B.  If, at the initial appearance, the vehicle operator pleads guilty to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or of the municipal OMVI ordinance or pleads no contest to and is convicted of the violation, the Court shall impose sentence upon the vehicle operator as provided by law or ordinance; the Court, except as provided in this subsection and subject to  4503.235 of the Revised Code, shall order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its identification license plates under  4503.233 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or the criminal forfeiture to the state of the vehicle under  4503.234 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whichever is applicable; and the vehicle and its identification license plates shall not be returned or released to the vehicle owner under subsection (C)(2)(A) of this section. If the vehicle operator is not the vehicle owner and the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf is not present at the vehicle operator's initial appearance and if the Court believes that the vehicle owner was not provided adequate notice of the initial appearance, the Court, in its discretion, may refrain for a reasonable period of time from ordering the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture to the state of the vehicle so that the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf may appear before the Court to present evidence as to why the Court should not order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture to the state of the vehicle. If the Court refrains from ordering the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates, or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle,  4503.235 of the Revised Code applies relative to the order of immobilization and impoundment, or the order of forfeiture. 
C.  If, at the initial appearance, the charge that the vehicle operator violated  4511.19 of the Revised Code or the municipal OMVI ordinance is dismissed for any reason, the Court shall order that the vehicle seized at the time of the arrest and its identification license plates immediately be returned or released to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf. 
D.  1.  If a vehicle and its identification license plates are seized under subsection B of this section, if at the initial appearance the vehicle operator does not plead guilty or no contest to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or the municipal OMVI ordinance with which he is charged, and if the vehicle and its identification license plates are not returned or released to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf pursuant to subsection C of this section, the vehicle or its license plates shall be retained or the vehicle shall remain under immobilization and its license plates shall be retained until the final disposition of the charge in question. Upon the final disposition of that charge, the Court shall do whichever of the following is applicable: 
A.  If the vehicle operator is convicted of or pleads guilty to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or of the municipal OMVI ordinance, the Court shall impose sentence upon the vehicle operator as provided by law or ordinance and, subject to  4503.235 of the Revised Code, shall order the immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its identification license plates under  4503.233 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle under  4503.234 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whichever is applicable. 
B.  If the vehicle operator is found not guilty of the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or of the municipal OMVI ordinance, the Court shall order that the vehicle and its identification license plates immediately be returned or released to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf. 
C.  If the charge that the vehicle operator violated  4511.19 of the Revised Code or the municipal OMVI ordinance is dismissed for any reason, the Court shall order that the vehicle and its identification license plates immediately be returned or released to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf. 
2.  If a vehicle and its identification license plates are seized under subsection B of this section, if at the initial appearance the vehicle operator does not plead guilty or no contest to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or of the municipal OMVI ordinance with which he is charged, and if the vehicle and its identification license plates are returned or released to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf pursuant to subsection C of this section, the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf shall bring the vehicle and its identification license plates to the proceeding at which final disposition is to be made of the charge in question. If the vehicle operator is convicted of or pleads guilty to the violation of  4511.19 of the Revised Code or of the municipal OMVI ordinance, the Court shall impose sentence upon the vehicle operator as provided by law or ordinance and, subject to  4503.235 of the Revised Code, shall order the immobilization of the vehicle he was operating at the time of the offense and the impoundment of its license plates under  4503.233 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or the criminal forfeiture to the State of the vehicle under  4503.234 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whichever is applicable. 
E.  If a vehicle is seized under subsection B of this section, the time between the seizure of the vehicle and either its release to the vehicle owner or a person acting on his behalf under subsection C of this section or the issuance of an order of immobilization of the vehicle and the impoundment of its license plates under  4503.233 and  4511.193 or  4511.99 of the Revised Code shall be credited against the period of immobilization and impoundment required under the order. 
F.  If a vehicle is ordered immobilized under R.C.  4503.233 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance and is found being operated upon any street or highway of this State during the immobilization period, it will be seized, removed from the street or highway, criminally forfeited to the State, and disposed of pursuant to  4503.234 [4503.23.4] of the Revised Code.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this traffic code, the City of Akron hereby adopts a civil enforcement system for automated mobile speed enforcement system violations as outlined in this section. Said system imposes monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator thereof to strictly comply with the posted speed limit in school zones or streets or highways within the City of Akron that include crosswalks used by children going to or leaving a school during recess and opening and closing hours. 
2.  The Akron Police Department shall be responsible for administering the automated mobile speed enforcement system. Specifically, the Akron Police Department shall be empowered to install and operate the automated mobile speed enforcement system within the City of Akron using trained technicians who may be police officers, Police Department employees, or other trained technicians who are not employees of the Akron Police Department. 
3.  Any citation for an automated mobile speed system violation pursuant to this section, known as a "notice of liability" shall: 
a.  Be processed by officials or agents of the City of Akron; and 
b.  Be forwarded by first-class mail or personal service to the vehicle's registered owner's address as given on the state's motor vehicle registration; and 
c.  Clearly state the manner in which the violation may be appealed. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  Automated mobile speed enforcement system is a system with one or more sensors working in conjunction with a speed measuring device to produce recorded images of motor vehicles traveling at a prohibited rate of speed. 
2.  "Hearing Officer" is the independent third party appointed by the Mayor. 
3.  "Vehicle owner" is the person or entity identified by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, or registered with any other state vehicle registration office, as the registered owner of a vehicle or a lessee of a motor vehicle under a lease of six months or more. 
C.  Offense. 
1.  The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle is operated at a speed in excess of those set forth in Section 73.20. 
2.  It is prima facie evidence that the person registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (or with any other state vehicle registration office) was operating the vehicle at the time of the offense set out in subsection (C)(l) of this section. 
3.  Notwithstanding subsection (C)(2) of this section, the owner of the vehicle shall not be responsible for the violation if, within twenty-one days from the date listed on the "notice of liability," as set forth in subsection (D)(2) of this section, he furnishes the Hearing Officer: 
a.  An affidavit by the vehicle owner, stating the name and address of the person or entity who leased the vehicle in a lease of six months or more at the time of the violation; or 
b.  A law enforcement incident report/general offense report from any state or local law enforcement agency/record bureau stating that the vehicle involved was reported as stolen before the time of the violation. 
4.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an owner of a vehicle for any violation of subsection (C)(l) or (C)(2) of this section. 
D.  Civil Penalties. 
1.  Unless the operator of the motor vehicle received a citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a civil penalty if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated mobile speed enforcement system while being operated in violation of this section. 
2.  Any violation of this section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty of one hundred fifty dollars shall be assessed to the owner for speed in excess of twenty miles per hour and less than thirty-five miles per hour in a school zone during restricted hours and a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars shall be assessed for speeds of thirty-five miles per hour or greater in a school zone during restricted hours. A civil penalty of one hundred fifty dollars shall be assessed for speeds in excess of the posted limits, but less than fifteen miles per hour over the posted limit, on streets and highways not in school zones that include crosswalks used by children going to or leaving school. A civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars shall be assessed for speeds that exceed the posted speed limit by fifteen miles per hour or greater on streets and highways not in school zones that include crosswalks used by children going to or leaving school. 
3.  A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section is not a moving violation for the purpose of assessing points under Ohio Revised Code Section 4507.021 for moving traffic offenses and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle and shall not be reported to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. 
E.  Collection of Civil Penalty. If the civil penalty is not paid, the civil penalty imposed under the provisions of this section shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by civil suit pursuant to procedures established by the City of Akron for the collection of debts. 
F.  Administrative Appeal. A notice of appeal shall be filed within twenty-one days from the date listed on the "notice of liability" with the Hearing Officer appointed by the Mayor of the City of Akron. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the civil penalty within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the citation and will be considered an admission of a violation of this section. Administrative appeals shall be heard through an administrative process established by the City of Akron. A decision in favor of the City of Akron may be enforced by means of a civil action or any other means provided by the Ohio Revised Code. 
G.  Funds.

a.  Is three years old or older; 
b.  Is extensively damaged, such damage, including, but not limited to, any of the following: missing wheels, tires, motors or transmission; 
c.  Does not comply with all safety laws and equipment provisions for motor vehicles as found in Chapter 74; 
d.  Has a fair market value of one thousand five hundred dollars or less; 
e.  Is not running and not operable ("operable" meaning able to be started and driven under its own power). 
2.  A junk motor vehicle left in the open is declared a nuisance and shall be abated in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
3.  " Motor vehicle ." Shall be defined as in  70.01 of this code. 
B.  Prohibitions. 
1.  No person shall willfully permit a junk motor vehicle to remain in the open on private property which the person owns, occupies or controls after receipt of an order to remove the junk motor vehicle. The order shall state that a hearing appealing the order to remove the junk motor vehicle may be had, shall describe the vehicle to be removed, and shall be served by an Inspector of the Department of Neighborhood Assistance by personal service to both an occupant of the property and the owner of the property, or if personal service is not accomplished, then by posting in a conspicuous location at the property affected and mailing, by regular mail, to the address of the affected property if there is a dwelling thereon and to the property owner at the location to which the Auditor mails the tax bill for the property affected. 
2.  If any recipient of an order to remove a junk motor vehicle or an unlicensed or inoperable vehicle under  94.16 shall fail to appeal the same in writing within seven days after its posting, personal service or mailing, whichever occurs first, to the Director of Neighborhood Assistance, it shall be conclusively presumed to establish the junk, unlicensed or inoperable motor vehicle as a nuisance and the motor vehicle shall be removed by the Police Division immediately. The fact that a junk motor vehicle or an unlicensed or inoperable vehicle under  94.16 is left on private property without the filing of an appeal by the recipient of an order to remove a junk, unlicensed or inoperable motor vehicle is prima facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the order. If, following appeal under  94.31 of this chapter, the Director affirms the order to remove a junk, unlicensed or inoperable motor vehicle, the Director shall order the removal of the particular vehicle by the Police Division. 
3.  No person shall leave a junk motor vehicle for any period of time on private property to which such person does not have the right of possession without the authorization of the person having the right of possession of such property. 
C.  Storage and Disposal of Junk Motor Vehicles.

After a motor vehicle has been determined to be a junk motor vehicle, as provided herein, the Police Division shall immediately cause the junk motor vehicle to be removed from the property where the junk motor vehicle is located by a salvage service duly designated by the Director of Neighborhood Assistance and stored in a designated facility. 
2.  Any junk motor vehicle which has been removed and stored pursuant to this section shall be disposed of in accordance with the following procedures: 
    The Chief of Police immediately shall cause a search to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Chief of Police.

The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim it upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of title to the motor vehicle. If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a search of the records of the Bureau has been conducted and after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search was conducted by the designated salvage service, and the notice was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the designated salvage service, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the designated salvage service a processing fee of twenty-five dollars, in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle. If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within ten days of the date of mailing of the notice: (a) the vehicle shall be disposed of by a motor vehicle salvage service or other facility as provided in  4513.62 of the Revised Code, (b) the Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it will be disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The Chief of Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Chief's records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage service or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage service, the Clerk of Courts shall issue to such owner a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. 
    Whenever a motor vehicle salvage service or other facility receives an affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the designated salvage service or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title to the motor vehicle in the salvage service's or facility's own name if the vehicle is dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the Clerk of Courts. 
D.  Whoever fails to remove a junk motor vehicle left in the open, after receipt of a proper order to remove the same, is guilty of a third degree misdemeanor. Each junk motor vehicle left in the open in violation of subsection B of this section shall constitute a separate offense. Every twenty days that this section is violated shall constitute a separate offense.

1.  A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations of any system in the City shall: 
a.

H.  Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the City, for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in accordance with this article. The rights to occupy the right-of-way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may locate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this article. Such providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this article. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any provisions of the Code or other applicable law. 
I.  Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state, and local authorities, and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents to the City. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to this article shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, small cell facilities, wireless facilities, wireless support structures, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

5.  The City shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation as referenced in Section 98.206(A)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in Section 98.206(A)(4). The product shall be a provider's then current annual registration maintenance fee. 
6.  The City shall perform its annual calculation of registration maintenance fees following receipt of the provider's required January 1 mileage report.

Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this article and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this article. The registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other assessment except as specifically provided in this article, or as required by applicable law. 
D.  Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration maintenance fee is not paid to the City by April 1, the provider shall pay a monthly late charge of one percent of the unpaid balance for each month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.

This section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under Section 98.219(D) (Emergency Situations) and Section 98.218 (Minor Maintenance). 
F.  Location of Facilities. 
1.  The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities, either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with all applicable laws and the City's rules and regulations. 
2.  The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is full, as determined in the sole discretion of the City. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among providers. 
G.  Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, and unless otherwise required by the Director of Public Service, every permittee when performing underground construction shall utilize trenchless technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional boring, and microtunneling.

H.  Special Exceptions. 
1.  The City may grant a special exception to the requirements of Section 98.217(F) and Section 98.217(G) if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence that the exception will not create any threat to the City's investment or in the rights-of-way, the public health, safety or welfare; and 
a.  Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits the ability of the permittee to provide services in the City; or 
b.  The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person; or 
c.  The requirements requested by the City herein create an unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential benefit to the City. 
I.  Relocation of Facilities. 
1.  A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way when necessary for governmental or public improvement purposes. In instances where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City may waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the rights-of-way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same size, substantially similar size, or smaller if permitted under current editions of applicable safety codes. In accordance with law, the Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with: 
a.  A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City. 
b.  The City's investment in the rights-of-way. 
c.  When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way. 
d.  The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part of a right-of-way. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the rights-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C.  723.041. 
3.  If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a provider fails to commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities, as designated by the City, within thirty days after the City's removal order, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the City, within twelve months thereafter, then, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the City shall have the right to: 
a.  Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or 
b.  Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in, on, over, or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense, by another person; however, the City shall have no liability for any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and 
c.  Any portion of the provider's facilities in, on, over, or under the rights-of-way of the City designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such ownership by the City. 
J.  Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. 
1.  Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. 
2.  All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation. 
K.  Rights-of-Way Restoration. 
1.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the City, the work to be done under the permit and the restoration of the rights-of-way as required herein must be completed within the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and City rules and regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the Restoration of Rights-of-Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions, the permittee shall notify the City of the inability to complete the restoration of the rights-of-way within the time specified in the permit. As soon as weather conditions make it possible to do so, permittee shall complete the restoration and notify the City of said completion. 
2.  In approving an application for a construction permit, the City may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or alternatively to restore the rights-of-way at the permittee's cost, if the permittee has in the past not abided by requirements of this Article. 
3.  At the time of application for a construction permit, permittee shall post a construction bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to its approximate pre-excavation condition. If, twelve months after completion of the restoration of the rights-of-way, the City determines that the rights-of-way have been properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released. The City may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirement of posting a construction bond upon demonstration of good cause shown. 
4.  The permittee shall perform the right-of way restoration work according to the standards and with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way; the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights-of-way base at the affected area, and in the most severe cases, milling, overlay and/or street reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work. 
5.  By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for twelve months following its completion. During this twelve-month period, it shall, upon notification from the Department of Public Service, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service, unless otherwise extended by the Department of Public Service. 
6.  If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the City, or permittee has previously failed to restore a right-of-way in a satisfactory manner, the City, at its option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall post a bond or provide letters of credit in an amount approximately equivalent to the estimated cost of the repair and pay to the City, within thirty days of billing, the balance of the restoration cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies. 
7.  If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same location and the same period of time as work by the City and/or another permittee(s), then the Director of Public Service may reasonably apportion the restoration responsibility among the City, providers and/or other persons subject to bond deposit and payment requirements as set forth above. 
L.  Damage to Other Facilities. 
1.  In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the City performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within thirty days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. 
2.  Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage caused by its facilities, either directly or indirectly, to the facilities of another provider. 
3.  Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any City-owned facilities in the rights-of-way that the provider or its facilities damage. 
M.  Rights-of-Way Vacation. 
1.  If the City sells or otherwise transfers a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a provider, such sale or transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements required pursuant to O.R.C.  723.041. 
N.  Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration, and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in conformance with all applicable law, City rules and regulations, and other standards as may be promulgated by the Director of Public Service. 
O.  Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service. 
1.  The permittee shall make the construction site available to the inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
2.  At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public, violates any law or that violates the term and conditions of the permit and/or this article. The City may inspect the work; however, the failure of the City to inspect the work does not alleviate the responsibility of the permittee to complete the work in accordance with the approved permit and the requirements of this article. 
3.  The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided in Section 98.222(E). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the Mayor whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke the permit and take all other action permitted by law. 
P.  Other Obligations. 
1.  Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other City, county, state, or federal laws. 
2.  Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including the Ohio Utility Protection Service. 
3.  Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. 
4.  No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section 98.219(D). 
5.  Permittee shall not obstruct a right-of-way so as to interfere with the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways. The Director of Public Service may waive this requirement upon good cause shown. 
6.  Private vehicles, other than necessary construction vehicles, may not be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
Q.  Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting a street or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this article, a provider shall locate facilities underground at the request of an adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities underground is consistent with the provider's normal construction and operating standards and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or above ground placement costs of identical facilities are borne directly by the property owner making the request. A provider, under any circumstance shall, upon the reasonable request of the City, always use best efforts to place facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and facilities installed), all facilities to be installed by a provider under the right-of-way shall be installed in conduit. 
(Ord. 266-2018)

B.  Permissive Denial of Permit. 
1.  The Director of Public Service may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and/or protect the City's investment in the right-of-way to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.

g.  The condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or 
h.  The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and/or 
i.  Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the requirements of this article, or, if applicable, any other law.

2.  To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of next year projects. 
D.  Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations. 
1.  Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify the Director of Public Service of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith or have those fees attributed to its quarterly invoice balance in accordance with Section 98.216(D) and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the event that the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's facilities, the City may use best efforts to contact the provider or the system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency. 
2.

The Director of Public Service may also, in his/ her discretion, place additional or revised conditions on the permit. 
3.  By the close of the next business day following receipt of notification of the violation, permittee shall contact the Director of Public Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its correction. Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

The full amount of the letter of credit or surety bond shall remain in full force and effect throughout the terms and conditions of this article and/or until any necessary site restoration is completed to restore the site to a condition comparable or better to that which existed prior to the issuance of certificate of registration. Unless a construction default, problem, or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable efforts to allow a provider a period of five calendar days after sending notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Service's attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond.

A provider or permittee shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider, permittee or to the City; and the provider or permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including without limitation workers' compensation claims against the City or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith), unless the act or omission is due to the City's negligence or willful acts; and 
i.  Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way contribute, and regardless of whether the negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage; and 
ii.  Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims arising out of or related to the City's actions; and 
iii.  Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with the provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business hereunder. 
2.  The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City: 
a.  Giving provider or permittee prompt notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is sought; and 
b.  Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and

98.222 - General provisions. 
A.  Non-exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this article are not exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at law or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the rights-of-way, including but not limited to damages to the rights-of-way, whether caused by a violation of any of the provisions of this article or other provisions of the City Code of Ordinances. 
B.  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
C.  Revocability. If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order that any permit, right or any portions of this section are illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving thirty days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right shall be considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable permit and the power to revoke it.

99.04 - Determination of income subject to tax. 
A.  In the taxation of income which is subject to this municipal income tax, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within or without the boundaries of the City disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the city, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of this tax. In the absence of such records, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of this tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of: 
1.  The average original cost of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. Real property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight; 
2.  Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are performed, excluding compensation that is not taxable by the city; 
3.  Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result. 
B.  As used in subsection A of this section, "sales made in the city" means: 
1.  All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of goods within the city; 
2.  All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and 
3.  All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place within the City to purchasers outside the City regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made. 
C.  In determining income subject to taxation, losses from the operation of a business or profession cannot be used to reduce wages from employment or other employment compensation. 
D.  The portion of a loss allowed to be deducted or carried forward by an Akron resident from the operation of a business or rental property shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  If the business or rental property is located within the corporate boundaries of the City of Akron, Ohio, or is in a jurisdiction that has no municipal or JEDD income tax, the entire loss may be deducted or carried forward against the same or other unincorporated business or rental profits, for a period of up to three years. 
2.  If the business or rental property is located outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Akron, Ohio, but is located in a jurisdiction that has a municipal or JEDD income tax, the amount of loss shall be calculated using the following formula: 
Step A- Subtract the tax rate of the other municipality or JEDD from the tax rate of Akron. Step B- If the result of Step A equals zero or less, stop. No amount of the loss can be deducted or carried forward. Step C- If the result of Step A is greater than zero, divide the result by the tax rate of Akron. Step D- Multiply the business loss by the result of Step C. This is the portion of the loss that can be deducted or carried forward against the same or other unincorporated business or rental profits, for a period of up to three years.

99.05 - Consolidated returns. 
A.  Filing consolidated returns is permitted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. 
B.  In the case of a C corporation that carried on transactions with its stockholders or with other C corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity within the City constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Commissioner may require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the city. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other C corporations related by stock ownership or interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the city.

12.  Salaries, wages, commissions, other compensation, other income and net profits including intangible income as provided in Ohio Revised Code 718.01, the taxation of which is prohibited by the Constitution of the State or any act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of the City to impose net income taxes.

This method of filing termed "universal filing" shall be in effect until such time as Council provides otherwise, subject to the exception set forth in subsection H of this section.

No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended. The Commissioner may deny the extension request if the taxpayer's income tax account with the City of Akron is delinquent in any manner. 
D.

4.  For failure to file income tax returns, fifty dollars for the first instance and one hundred dollars for each subsequent instance. 
C.  A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made by the Tax Commissioner when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Commissioner.

B.  Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a C corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any employer does not discharge the officers' or employees' liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay the taxes due.

99.20 - Income tax for community learning centers. 
    In addition to the tax imposed pursuant to  99.03, an annual tax for the purposes set forth in this section is imposed on and after January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2033, at the rate of 0.25% per year, on all taxable income. Notwithstanding  99.17, the funds collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid into a separate fund, the Community Learning Center Income Tax Fund, and applied solely for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, renovating, repairing, enlarging, adding to, reconstructing, maintaining, equipping, furnishing, acquiring interests in real property in connection therewith, improving the sites thereof, and otherwise improving community centers, in accordance with Section 755.16 of the Revised Code, and paying debt service and other costs relating to the financing thereof.

A cooperative agreement may provide for the term of the agreement, the applicable allocation of the income tax proceeds, the transfer of funds from the city, which may be by grant, loan, payment under such agreement, or otherwise, the ownership, use, operation and maintenance of the community learning centers, cooperation with state commissions or agencies in the financing of the community learning centers, and other provisions as determined by the parties thereto. In the event that other funding for community learning centers or related educational facilities becomes available to the Akron City School District for the specific purpose of providing community learning centers or related purposes from the county through sales tax proceeds or otherwise or from the state or federal government beyond the amount of the state funds currently allocated for permanent improvements to the Akron City School District, the City by ordinance shall, on a biennial basis, reduce the income tax rate provided in this section from 0.25% to a percentage that will generate tax proceeds in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of proceeds that would be generated from the 0.25% rate and the amount of funds available for such purpose from another source, subject to debt service requirements on indebtedness incurred by the City for that purpose.

    To provide funds for the establishment of a convention bureau, the development of an exhibition hall in the Cascade Urban Renewal area, and the preparation of a long-term feasibility study relative to a convention center and exhibition hall and all matters related thereto, this hotel-motel tax is established. 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.31 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    "Board of Review." The Board of Review created and established under  99.16. 
    "Hotel" and "motel." Every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised, or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures. 
    "Occupancy." The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or the right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample, or display space shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, has the right to use or possess, all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
    "Operator." Any person who is the proprietor of the hotel or motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.32 - Imposition of tax. 
A.  For the purpose of providing revenue with which to fund the activities listed in  99.30, an excise tax is levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel is or is to be furnished to transient guests. 
B.  The tax is three percent on all rents paid or to be paid by transient guests for the lodging. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the city, which debt is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the city, or to the city. The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. 
C.  For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels and motels in the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established. 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.33 - Exemptions. 
A.  No tax shall be imposed under this article on:

2.  Rents paid by the City or any of its political subdivisions. 
B.  No exemption claimed under subsection A of this section shall be granted except on a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury on a form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.34 - False evidence of tax-exempt status.

(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.35 - Payment by transient guest. 
A.  The tax imposed by this article shall be paid by the transient guest to the operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. 
B.  If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies. 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.36 - Statement and charge of tax. 
A.  The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and on every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or delivered by the operator. The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as trustee for and on account of the City and the operator shall be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax. 
B.  No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

99.37 - Registration. 
    Within thirty days after the effective date of Ordinance 803-1972, passed November 28, 1972 or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel or motel renting lodging to transient guests shall register the hotel or motel with the Tax Commissioner and obtain from him a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate, which Certificate shall be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The Certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel or motel; 
C.  The date upon which Certificate was issued; and 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Hotel-Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Commissioner of the City of Akron for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Hotel-Motel Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Commissioner of the City of Akron. This Certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.38 - Records. 
    Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount due under this article, and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if exempted for any other reason. The records and other documents shall be opened during business hours to the inspection of the Tax Commissioner and shall be preserved for a period of three years, unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or unless the Tax Commissioner orders that such records be kept for a longer period of time. 
(Ord. 803-1972) 
99.39 - Returns and payment. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter year, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Commissioner, make a return to the Tax Commissioner, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected by transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this article shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment is made to the Tax Commissioner.

(6)  Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator of undocumented credits or losses. 
(G)  (1) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under subsection (G) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code.

The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator. 
(c)  In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less. 
(2)  If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns. 
(3)  With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 104.082 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this subsection conflicts with any provision in Section 104.082 of this chapter, the provision in Section 104.082 of this chapter prevails. 
(H)  (1) For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due is ten dollars or less. 
(2)  Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a taxable year pursuant to subsection (H)(1) of this section shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return under subsection (F)(3) and (4) of this section.

(1)  If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service. 
(2)  If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer. 
(J)  The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 104.091 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
(K)  Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters. 
(L)  The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents. 
(M)  When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. 
(N)  (1) As used in this subsection, "worksite location" has the same meaning as in Section 104.092 of this chapter. 
(2)  A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable year if both of the following conditions apply: 
(a)  The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  The person no longer provides services in the municipal corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's income tax for the taxable year. 
    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury. 
(c)  If a person submits an affidavit described in subsection (N)(2) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in subsection (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

Any documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of undocumented credits or losses.

Except as provided in subsection (B)(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.

For the purpose of computing the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in subsection (A)(4) of Section 104.13 of this chapter.

104.091 - Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages. 
(A)  (1) Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section 104.092 of this chapter or subsection (D) or (F) of this section. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee. 
(2)  In addition to withholding the amounts required under subsection (A)(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident. 
(B)  (1) An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following schedule: 
(a)  Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required to make payments under subsection (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter. 
(b)  Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars. Payment under subsection (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each month. 
(c)  Intentionally left blank. 
(d)  An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this subsection does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax withholding payment is due. 
(C)  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this subsection shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers to file a tax return under Section 104.081 of this chapter. 
(D)  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's successor entity. 
(E)  (1) An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax. 
(2)  The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld. 
(F)  Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed. 
(G)  Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator. 
(H)  On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee, and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator. 
(I)  The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due. 
(J)  An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this subsection, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means. 
(K)  A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the purposes of this section.

To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.

(B)  (1) A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service as set forth in this subsection. A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail.

    A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This subsection does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney. 
(D)  A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit examination. 
(E)  The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.

(B)  Every taxpayer who resides in the City but receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions, other compensation, and other income from a resident or nonresident business entity or association of which he is a partner or owner, for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the City, if it is made to appear that he or such business entity has paid a municipal or a Joint Economic Development District income tax on or with respect to the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality or to a Joint Economic Development District, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter in the amount so paid by him, in his behalf or by such business entity, to the other municipality or to a Joint Economic Development District. In no event, however, shall any municipal income tax or any Joint Economic Development District income tax to the extent paid to another municipality or to a Joint Economic Development District and allowed as a credit hereunder be deductible in computing the net profit of such taxpayer or such business entity. In addition, the credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on income earned in such other municipality or municipalities or Joint Economic Development District(s) where the tax is paid. Further, the credit given for taxes paid to another municipality or JEDD shall not exceed the actual tax imposed by that municipality or JEDD.

(A)  As used in this section: 
(1)  "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(2)  (a) Except as provided in subsection (A)(2)(b) of this section, "qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(b)  If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the amount resulting from the calculation described in subsection (A)(2)(a) of this section computed without regard to subsection (A)(2)(b) of this section and a fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(c)  With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(3)  "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(B)  (1) Except as provided in subsection (D) of this section, a refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate. 
(2)  A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable years. 
(3)  If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(4)  In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(C)  (1) For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
(2)  Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the municipal corporation by the taxpayer. 
(D)  The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to: 
(1)  The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or 
(2)  The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred compensation. 
(Ord. 360-2015) 
104.183 - Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund. 
(A)  Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds as provided in Section 104.086 of this chapter. 
(B)  Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in Section 104.086, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment. 
(C)  No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is beyond the three- year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section 104.086 of this chapter. 
(D)  Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 104.18 of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group. 
(b)  Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations required in Section 104.32 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation.

(4)  If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by Sections 104.30 to 104.46 of this chapter that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections 104.30 to 104.46 of this chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed. 
(5)  If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections 104.30 to 104.46 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on the return.

(A)  If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections 104.30 to 104.46 of this chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's possession. 
    The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time limit in Section 104.42 of this chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment as required by Sections 104.30 to 104.46 of this chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in Section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition. 
(B)  Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under Section 5703.60 of the Revised Code. 
(C)  After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the Office of the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County. 
    Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the Clerk shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "Special Judgments for Municipal Income Taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 
    If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is Certified to the Attorney General for collection under Section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment under this section.

Immediately upon the issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by subsection (C) of this section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in Section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the Clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with subsection (B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment. 
(F)  Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition. 
    If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner. Upon petition so filed or pursuant to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 104.42 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.

The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return. 
(B)  In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a return subject to assessment under Section 104.41 of this chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return. 
(C)  In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed under this subsection within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in Section 104.42 of this chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that section. An application filed under this subsection shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in Section 104.42 of this chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.

The Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation. 
(C)  The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income.

B.  Regardless of the penalty which may be imposed, any offense specifically classified as a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor. 
C.  Any offense not specifically classified is a misdemeanor if imprisonment for not more than one year may be imposed as a penalty. 
D.  Any offense not specifically classified is a minor misdemeanor if the only penalty which may be imposed is a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars. (R.C.  2901.02) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.04 - Common law offenses abrogated. 
A.  No conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the municipality unless it is defined as an offense in this code or in any other ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of the municipality. 
B.  An offense is defined when one or more sections of this code state a positive prohibition or enjoin a specific duty, and provide a penalty for violation of such prohibition or failure to meet such duty. 
C.  This section does not affect the power of a court to punish for contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law to enforce an order, civil judgment or decree. (R.C.  2901.03) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.05 - Rule of construction. 
A.  Sections of this code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the prosecution, and liberally construed in favor of the accused. 
B.  Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Ohio Revised Code providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair, impartial, speedy and sure administration of justice. (R.C.  2901.04) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.06 - Limitations of criminal prosecutions. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is committed: 
1.  For a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years; 
2.  For a minor misdemeanor, six months. 
B.  If the period of limitation provided in subsection A of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the offense either by an aggrieved person or by his legal representative who is not himself a party to the offense.

D.  An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct, the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first. 
E.  A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever occurs first.

F.  The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus delicti remains undiscovered.

(R.C.  2901.13) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.07 - Requirements for criminal liability. 
A.  Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply: 
1.  His liability is based on conduct which includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty which he is capable of performing; 
2.  He has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense. 
B.  When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in such section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specified culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense. 
C.  As used in this section: 
1.  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient time to have ended his possession. 
2.  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts. 
3.  "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined in  130.08, or any other specific mental state required by any section of this title. (R.C.  2901.21) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.08 - Culpable mental states. 
A.  A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature. 
B.  A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that the circumstances probably exist. 
C.  A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that the circumstances are likely to exist. 
D.  A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the circumstances may exist. 
E.  When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is also sufficient culpability for the element. When recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for the element. When knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for the element. (R.C.  2901.22) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.09 - Organizational criminal liability. 
A.  For the purpose of this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association, estate, trust, or other commercial or legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
B.  An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances: 
1.  The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such provisions shall apply. 
2.  A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such provisions shall apply. 
3.  The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed by law on the organization. 
4.  If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of his office or employment. 
C.  When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the contrary plainly appears. 
D.  In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense. (R.C.  2901.23) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.10 - Personal accountability for organizational conduct. 
A.  An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined in  130.09 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense, and any of the following apply: 
1.  In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct responsibility. 
2.  He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged. 
B.  When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (R.C.  2901.24) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.11 - Attempt. 
A.  No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense. 
B.  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was impossible under the circumstances. 
C.  No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of complicity in the commission of the offense, or of conspiracy to commit the offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in violation of this section. 
D.  It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. 
E.  Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder or murder is a felony of the first degree. An attempt to commit an aggravated felony of the first or second degree is an aggravated felony of the next lesser aggravated degree than the aggravated felony attempted. An attempt to commit an aggravated felony of the third degree is a felony of the fourth degree. An attempt to commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C. Chapter 3734 other than R.C.  3734.18 that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony punishable by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than eighteen months, or both. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under this section. Penalty, see  130.99. (R.C.  2923.02) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.12 - Complicity. 
A.  No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: 
1.  Solicit or procure another to commit the offense; 
2.  Aid or abet another in committing the offense; 
3.  Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C.  2923.01; 
4.  Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense. 
B.  It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender. 
C.  No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of  130.11. 
D.  If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.  2923.03(D).

A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense. Penalty, see  130.99. (R.C.  2923.03) 
(Ord. 728-1973) 
130.13 - Conspiracy. 
A.  No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the commission of any offense under these codified ordinances or a fourth degree felony offense of promoting prostitution, arson, unauthorized use of a vehicle or trafficking in marihuana, corrupting another with drugs, trafficking in drugs, theft of drugs, or illegal processing of drug documents or the commission of a violation of any provision of R.C. Ch. 3734 other than R.C.  3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, shall do either of the following: 
1.  With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the commission of any such offense; 
2.  Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any such offense. 
B.  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or a person with whom he conspired, subsequent to the accused's entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt act is substantial when it is of such character as to manifest a purpose on the part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should he completed. 
C.  When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a person with whom he conspires has also conspired or is conspiring with another to commit the same offense, then the offender is guilty of conspiring with that other person, even though his identity may be unknown to the offender. 
D.  It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect, commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible under the circumstances. 
E.  A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its objects are committed, or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed. 
F.  A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of only one conspiracy, when such offenses are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. 
G.  When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the specific offense, he shall not he convicted of conspiracy involving the same offense. 
H.  1.  No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of a person with whom he conspired, unsupported by other evidence. 
2.  If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.  2923.01(H)(2). 
3.  "Conspiracy," as used in subsection (H)(1) of this section, does not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or in the commission of an offense. 
I.  The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy: 
1.  After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose; 
2.  After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of his abandonment or by informing any law enforcement authority of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation in the conspiracy. 
J.  This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of these codified ordinances or of the Ohio Revised Code, other than this section. In such case, however: 
1.  With respect to the offense specified as the object of the conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection A of this section defines the voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the conspiracy; 
2.  Subsections B through I of this section are incorporated by reference in the conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of these codified ordinances or of the Ohio Revised Code. 
K.  Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, an offense of the next lesser degree than the most serious offense which is the object of the conspiracy. In the case of conspiracy to commit an offense not specifically classified, conspiracy is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

The notice and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to respond to and abate a similar future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of response and abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activities as set forth in this section. The notice shall further state that if a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in subsection A of this section occurs within six months of the date of the notice, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. Notice shall be served on the owner personally or by certified mail and regular mail to the person's residence, regular place of business or last known address. If the certified or regular mail is returned undelivered, a copy shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or on the person's residence, regular place of business, last known address, or the property affected. 
C.  If within six months of the date of the notice referred to in subsection B of this section, a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in subsection A of this section occurs, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement action, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. The costs of such response and abatement shall be calculated as set forth in subsection D of this section. Any further nuisance activity that occurs within six months of a nuisance activity for which the owner has been given notice of assessment may be charged to the owner. 
D.  Costs of abatement shall be calculated by multiplying the highest hourly wage of a patrol officer by the number of police officers involved in the response to abate the nuisance activity times the number of hours required by the police officers to abate the nuisance in hourly increments, with a minimum of one hour and include an administrative charge of two hundred dollars or ten percent of the costs of abatement, whichever is greater. 
E.  The Chief of Police shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City's intent to assess the costs of response and abatement against the owner's property.

2.  The Board of Nuisance Abatement shall hear any appeals made in accordance with subsection F of this section. 
3.  Hearing of Appeal. In any such appeal, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being appealed has occurred, and that the intent of the City to assess the property for abatement costs is justified. The City shall not have to show that there has been a conviction for a criminal offense to show the existence of a nuisance. The City shall be deemed to have failed to have met this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that: 
a.  He was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance activity that is the basis of the notice; or 
b.  He had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of O.R.C.  5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9); or 
c.  He had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of O.R.C.  5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9). 
4.  Any appeal from a decision of the Board of Nuisance Abatement shall be made pursuant to O.R.C. Chapter 2506. 
H.  After final decisions on any requests for reconsideration or further appeals have been issued and the costs to abate have not been paid within thirty days of the notice of such decision, the costs of abatement shall be reported to the Director of Finance, who shall mail a statement of the amount thereof to the owner of the property. 
1.  If after thirty days such amount remains unpaid, the Director of Finance shall certify the total amount of the expenses, the name of the owner of the land and a sufficient description of the premises to the County Auditor, to be entered on the tax duplicate, to be a lien on the land from the date of entry and to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the city pursuant to O.R.C. 731.54. 
I.  The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the assessment of costs by the city on a property, do not affect or limit the city's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal action, including nuisance abatement and assessment as provided by law.

4.  Removal of Advertising Devices. 
a.  The Superintendent may order the removal of highway advertising devices that are nonconforming, in accordance with subsection (B)(3) of this section, and each such removal of any highway advertising device ordered by the Superintendent shall be deemed to constitute a taking of all right, title, and interest in such highway advertising device, including any leasehold interest, of the owner of the highway advertising device and of the right of the owner of real property on which the highway advertising device is located to erect and maintain such interests in any such taking, in the same manner as other property is acquired for state highway purposes pursuant to O.R.C. Chapter 163, notwithstanding the right or obligation of the owner of such highway advertising device, as against the owner of the real property on which the highway advertising device is located, to remove such device at any time. If the City and such owner of a compensable right or interest under this subsection B of this section do not reach agreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid for the taking of such right or interest, the City shall institute an action to appropriate the interest of such person in accordance with O.R.C.

b.  No nonconforming highway advertising device may be maintained without a permit, except that permits shall be issued to maintain such nonconforming highway advertising devices subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (B)(3) of this section. If such permit has been previously issued by the city, a copy thereof may be furnished to the State Director of Transportation in lieu of securing a permit as required by state law. 
c.  Applications for such permits shall be made to the Superintendent and permits authorized herein shall not unreasonably be withheld, provided that no permit for the erection of an advertising device under subsections (B)(1)(a) and (2)(a) of this section shall be issued by the Superintendent without the prior approval of the State Director of Transportation.

153.390 - Intent. 
    Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, or amendments thereto which may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this Zoning Code was enacted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of this Zoning Code or of future amendments. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code that nonconformities shall not be encouraged to expand without restriction, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

153.392 - Incompatibility of nonconforming uses. 
    Nonconforming uses are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged in any way, including attachment to a building or premises of signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located, except as hereafter provided in this chapter. 
(Prior code  153.256; Ord. 322-1976) 
153.394 - Avoidance of undue hardship. 
A.

B.  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the restoration of a structure wholly or partly destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy subsequent to the effective date of this Zoning Code or an amendment thereof, or prevent the continuance of the use of such building or part thereof as such use existed at the time of such destruction, or prevent a change or expansion of such existing use as provided in this chapter. 
C.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, on order of such official. 
D.  Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any wall, building, or part thereof declared to be unsafe by the Superintendent of Building Inspection.

153.396 - Structures and uses nonconforming by use district. 
    Where, at the time of the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, lawful uses of buildings, structures, land, and premises exist which would not be permitted under the subdivision of uses imposed by this Zoning Code, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided that: 
A.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code. 
B.  No such nonconforming use structure shall be enlarged or altered in a way which increases or maintains its nonconformity except as provided in Section 153.404, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease or eliminate its nonconformity. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Zoning Code or an amendment thereof shall be erected in connection with a nonconforming use of land, except as provided in Section 153.404. 
C.  A building, structure, or premises devoted to a nonconforming use, if changed to a use included in the subdivision of uses for the district in which it is located, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the subdivision of uses. A nonconforming use may be arranged to another nonconforming use only if such use is included in the subdivision of uses for the district in which the nonconforming use is included, or a district that precedes, in Section 153.225, the subdivision in which the nonconforming use is included. 
D.  When a nonconforming use of a structure or premises other than a sexually oriented business use, is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than two years, the structure, building, or premises shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the subdivision of uses for the use district in which it is located. 
E.  Any sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the effective date of Section 153.299 of this code that is in violation of Section 153.299 of this code shall be deemed a nonconforming use. A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use is not rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a church, public or private elementary or secondary school, public park or library within one thousand feet, or a residential district within five hundred feet, of the sexually oriented business. When a nonconforming sexually oriented business use of a structure or premises is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than six months, the structure, building, or premises shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the subdivision of uses for the use district in which it is located. Penalty, see  153.199.

4.  Issue an order as described in subsection (B) of this section. 
B.  Orders. 
1.  Upon the Board's findings of fact made, the Board shall issue an order commanding that the vacant commercial or industrial building be repaired or demolished. 
2.  In the event the Board orders repairs under subsection (C) of this section, the order shall be served upon any owner or interested party appearing at the hearing personally or by regular mail. 
3.  When the Board determines the vacant commercial or industrial building or property is a public nuisance, and in all cases where it cannot be repaired, or where the owner refuses or fails to repair the commercial property so that it will no longer be in violation of any of the terms of this chapter, it shall be demolished. In all cases where it is a fire hazard, existing or erected in violation of any of the terms of this chapter or any ordinances of the City, it shall be demolished. 
4.  In the event the Board orders demolition, the order shall be served on all persons specified in subsection (A)(1) and by the method stated therein, shall state that the building will be demolished by the City, and shall state that there is a right to appeal the Board's order pursuant to O.R.C. Chapter 2506. 
5.  The Board shall advise the Director of the particulars involved so the appropriate action may be instituted to cause the building to be demolished and/or to abate the offending condition at the owner's expense. 
C.  Repairs. The Board may grant a thirty to ninety day extension to a property owner or interested party for compliance with the provisions of this chapter only upon a showing of satisfactory assurance to the Board that the property owner or interested party has the financial and practical capability of initiating and completing the required repairs to the premises within the time extended. After one thirty- to ninety-day extension has been granted, additional thirty- to ninety-day extensions for repairs may be granted only upon a showing to the Board of substantial progress toward completion of required repairs at the owner's building. In the event of noncompliance, to any extent, or partial repairs to the building by the owner, the Board may at any time declare the building to be a public nuisance and order that the building be razed and any offending condition abated. 
D.  Non-compliance. Should the owner fail, neglect, or refuse to pay the costs so incurred by virtue of the demolition or abatement of any offending condition, the costs shall be paid out of the City treasury on the certificate of the Director of Neighborhood Assistance, and the Director of Finance shall then certify the amount so paid to the Fiscal Officer of Summit County. The Fiscal Officer shall enter the amount on the tax duplicate of the County as a special assessment against the real estate on which the building or property requiring the work is or was situated, and the assessment shall be collected as other taxes and assessments and, when collected, shall be refunded to the City. 
E.  Bond to Promote Rehabilitation; Reconsideration; No Right of Appeal Created. 
1.  Bond to Promote Rehabilitation. After the deadline for appeal of any demolition order issued by the Board has passed, at the discretion of the Director and upon the request of the Owner or person affected by the decision of the Board, the order of the Board that a building must be demolished may be stayed upon the posting of a bond or other method of surety in an amount equal to the anticipated expense of demolition as determined by the Director with the assistance of the Building Inspection Superintendent and/or estimated by a reputable and qualified demolition contractor. 
a.  The bond posted under this subsection shall include as a condition that if repairs are not performed to the satisfaction of the Director, the stay shall be rescinded, and the bond shall be forfeited to the City to be applied toward the expense of executing demolition. 
b.  If the repairs are not performed to the satisfaction of the Director, the stay shall be rescinded, the bond forfeited to the City to be applied toward the expense of demolition, and any excess amount returned to the party that posted the bond. 
c.  If the repairs are performed to the satisfaction of the Director, the bond, minus any expenses incurred by the City during the period of the stay, shall be returned to the party that posted the bond. 
2.  Reconsideration. Upon the Director determining that the repairs to the building have resulted in a change of circumstance sufficient for the Board to reconsider its prior decision that the building must be demolished, the matter will be presented to the Board for reconsideration, such that the Board may vacate its demolition order. 
3.  No Right of Appeal Created. This subsection is intended to promote compromise by the City and an affected person when compromise serves the interests of both. This subsection is not intended to create a right of appeal where such right does not otherwise exist, such as for failure to timely appeal the demolition order of the Board or an attempt to collaterally attack a timely but unsuccessful appeal of a decision of the Board.

(Ord. 538-2001; Ord. 388-1998) 
(Ord. 291-2013) 
197.313 - Conditions for variances. 
    Variances may only be issued where, due to physical characteristics of the property, compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship. 
A.  Size Factor. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided  197.312, 197.314 and 197.315 of this building code have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Exception. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Flood Discharge Increases. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Minimum Variance. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  General Considerations. Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on, or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and 
4.  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
F.  Written Notice. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. 538-2001; Ord. 388-1998)
