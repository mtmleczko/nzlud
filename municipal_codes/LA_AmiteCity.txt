FOREWORD 
    This code of ordinances is provided by the Louisiana Municipal Association as a part of its services program for cities, towns and villages in Louisiana. Technical staff assistance has been provided by PRM Law Publishers of Atlanta, Georgia, which was responsible for the organization, codification, indexing and printing of this code. 
    This codification provides a complete revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the Town of Amite City. All obsolete, illegal or superseded ordinances have been repealed as a part of the codification. All amended ordinances are brought up to date. The code also includes certain new ordinances that were prepared to fill in gaps not covered by existing ordinances. 
    The code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The Table of Contents with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the alphabetical index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter. 
    Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part 1 of the code that applies to the entire code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references, and amendment notes have been included throughout the code to clarify its provisions. 
    The citations included at the end of sections apply to the original source and approval date of ordinances. Sections of the code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
    The new code is published in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be printed for inclusion therein on a regular basis. The Louisiana Municipal Association has available a periodic updating service. Such service can be secured through an agreement between the Municipality and the Association under which the town clerk would send new ordinances, and amendments to ordinances, and the Association would provide new and replacement pages for the code. 
    We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the town officials in the preparation of this code.

CHAPTER 3. - TOWN OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES 
ARTICLE A. - PERSONNEL REGULATIONS 

Section 2-3001. - Employee leave policy. 
(a)  Generally. Full-time employees shall be eligible for annual leave, sick leave, family and medical leave, civil leave, funeral leave, military leave, education leave, maternity leave, and leave of absence without pay, as provided in this section. 
(b)  Annual leave. 
(1)  "Annual Leave" is leave with pay granted to a full-time employee for the purpose of rehabilitation, restoration, and maintenance of work efficiency, or transaction of personal affairs. 
(2)  Annual leave shall be earned on a pro-rata basis for each month of full-time employment as follows: 
Period of 
Employment Annual Leave Earned 0 to 1 year* 1.54 hours per month = 
40 hours per year 1 year to 10 years 3.08 hours per month = 
80 hours per year 10 years and above 4.62 hours per month = 
120 hours per year  
*Employees shall not be made eligible to use annual leave until after having completed one (1) year of continuous employment. 
(3)  No employee shall be credited with annual leave for any calendar month: 
a.  During which he has been on leave without pay for ten (10) or more working days. 
b.  While he is on leave with or without pay, until such time as he returns to active working duty. 
(4)  An employee may carry over or accumulate unused annual leave from one (1) fiscal year to another but not to exceed two hundred forty (240) hours (thirty (30) working days) as of the last day of the year, December 31. 
(5)  Annual leave may be taken as earned by an employee with the approval of the employee's supervisor. However, annual leave is permissive and may be denied by the employee's supervisor or the mayor when conditions are such that the ordinary work of the municipality could not be performed adequately if annual leave were granted. Annual leave may not be taken in less than four-hour increments. 
(6)  The mayor or authorized supervisor may require an employee, other than a police officer, to take annual leave whenever in his administrative judgment such action would be in the best interest of the municipality. 
(7)  The chief of police may require police personnel to take annual leave whenever in his administrative judgment such action would be in the best interest of the municipality. 
(8)  No employee shall be granted any annual leave not credited to the employee's account at the time the absence occurs. 
(9)  Upon termination of employment, all unused annual leave accrued by an employee shall be paid to the terminating employee (regardless if termination is voluntary or involuntary) not to exceed two hundred forty (240) hours. Employees with less than one (1) year of full-time employment are not considered vested for annual leave purposes and any annual leave accrued upon termination shall be canceled. 
(c)  Sick leave. 
(1)  "Sick leave" is leave with pay granted a full-time employee who is suffering with a disability which prevents him from performing his usual duties and responsibilities or who requires medical, dental, or optical consultation or treatment. 
(2)  After an employee's first full-time employment anniversary date, sick leave may also be used for immediate family. For this purpose, "immediate family" includes spouse, child, grandchild, mother, father, grandparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother, and sister. 
(3)  Sick leave with pay is not a right which an employee may demand but a privilege granted by the municipality. 
(4)  Leave from work with pay may be charged as sick leave if the absence is due to sickness, bodily injury, quarantine, required physical or dental examinations or treatment, or exposure to a contagious disease when continued work might jeopardize the health of others. All such absences except those resulting from intemperance or immorality shall be charged against the sick leave credit of the employee. 
(5)  Sick leave credits accumulated by each employee as of effective date of this section shall be retained. 
(6)  a.  Each full-time employee shall be credited with sick leave at the rate of 1.85 hours per two-week pay period worked for the first year of full-time employment. 
b.  Each employee with more than one year of service as a full-time employee shall be credited with 3.70 hours of sick leave for each two-week pay period worked. 
c.  No employee shall be credited with sick leave for any calendar month: 
1.  During which he has been on leave without pay for ten (10) or more working days. 
2.  While he is on leave with or without pay, until such time as he returns to active working duty. 
(7)  The mayor shall determine when a doctor's certificate is required and under what conditions certificates are required. Supervisors shall be responsible for the application of this provision so that there will be no abuse of sick leave privileges. 
(8)  a.  Employees who resign or who are dismissed from employment shall not be paid for any accrued sick leave and all such leave shall be canceled. 
b.  Employees who retire at or after age sixty (60) with at least ten (10) years of creditable full-time employment or at or after age fifty-five (55) with at least thirty (30) years of creditable full-time employment are entitled (as an employment benefit) to he paid for unused sick leave computed as follows: 
For each year of creditable employment, an employee will be paid at date of retirement unused accrued sick leave at an amount equal to 1.67 percent for each year of creditable employment not to exceed fifty (50) percent of the retiring employee's unused sick leave at date of retirement. 
The town maintains its sick leave records in units of hours (or days). The amount to be paid shall be the percent determined in the preceding paragraph multiplied by the unused sick leave hours at the employee's final-average hourly salary. Final-average hourly salary is the employee's average salary over the last thirty-six (36) consecutive months at date of retirement. Retirement for this purpose shall be the same as defined by the Municipal Employees' Retirement System of Louisiana. 
(9)  a.  The mayor or authorized supervisor may place an employee, other than a police officer, on sick leave when the employee asserts the need to be absent from the work place because of the employee's illness or injury. 
b.  The chief of police may place police personnel on sick leave when the employee asserts the need to be absent from the work place because of the employee's illness or injury.

(3)  a.  An employee who has taken family and medical leave shall provide a certificate signed by a doctor to support his claim for leave for his own serious health condition or to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. If the leave is due to the employee's own medical condition, the certificate must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his position. If the leave is to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to care for the child, spouse, or parent. 
b.  The municipality may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertification at its own expense. 
c.  If the first and second opinions differ, the municipality, at its own expense, may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the municipality and the employee. 
(4)  If an employee takes such leave on an intermittent or on a reduced leave schedule that reduces the employee's usual number of hours worked per week or per work day, the municipality may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates the leave than the employee's regular position, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits. 
(5)  An employee who takes such leave to care for a newborn child or a child which has been placed with the employee for adoption or foster care may not take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the municipality and the employee agree to such an arrangement. 
(e)  Civil leave. 
(1)  An employee shall be given time off without loss of pay, annual leave, or sick leave when: 
a.  Performing jury duty. 
b.  Summoned to appear as a witness before a court, grand jury, or other public body or commission, provided that for purposes of this provision a plaintiff or defendant shall not be considered a witness.

(g)  Military leave.

(h)  Education leave. A leave of absence at full or part pay may be granted by the mayor and board to permit a full-time employee to take courses of study which will better equip the employee to perform his duties for the municipality. 
(i)  Maternity leave. 
(1)  Absence from work caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions is considered to be a temporary disability which prevents an employee from performing the usual duties associated with employment. A full-time female employee may take up to six (6) weeks of sick leave for maternity reasons, unless a doctor certifies, in writing, that an extended amount of time is needed due to medical causes. 
(2)  If accrued sick leave is exhausted, and additional leave is needed due to illness or disability, compensatory leave or annual leave, or both, may be used, subject to the approval of the appropriate supervisor. If all accrued sick leave, annual leave, and compensatory leave have been exhausted, the employee may take leave of absence without pay in accordance with subsection (j)(1) of this section. 
(j)  Leave of absence without pay. 
(1)  "Leave of absence without pay" means time off from work without pay granted by the mayor, or authorized supervisor, or imposed by the mayor, or authorized supervisor, for an unapproved absence.

This leave of absence with pay shall not be charged against the employee's accumulated annual or sick leave, provided that such payments by the town when combined with worker's compensation payments will not exceed the employee's regular salary as paid by the town, not including supplemental pay from the State of Louisiana.

ARTICLE C. - SALES AND USE TAX 

Section 2-4021. - Imposition of tax. 
(a)  A certain document on file in the office of the clerk identified as the "sales and use tax" Ordinance No. 480, effective October 1, 1965, and providing for the levy of a general sales tax of one (1) percent as provided therein is incorporated in this code and made a part hereof by reference. 
(b)  There is hereby levied from and after January 1, 1982, for the purpose stated in the proposition set forth in the preamble to this ordinance adopted December 7, 1982, a tax upon the sale at retail, the use, the lease or rental, the consumption and the storage for use or consumption of tangible personal property and upon the sale of services within this town, as defined herein (Ordinance No. 480) and the levy of such tax shall be as follows: 
(1)  At the rate of one (1) percent of the cost price of each item or article or tangible personal property when sold at retail in this town; the tax to be computed on gross sales for the purpose of remitting the amount of tax due the town, and to include each and every retail sale. 
(2)  At the rate of one (1) percent of the cost price of each item or articles of tangible personal property when the same is not sold, but is used, consumed, distributed or stored for use or consumption in this town, provided, there shall be no duplication of the tax. 
(3)  At the rate of one (1) percent of the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, as defined herein, where the lease or rental of such property is an established business, or part of an established business or the same is incidental or germane to the business. 
(4)  At the rate of one (1) percent of the monthly lease or rental price paid by lessee or rentee or contracted or agreed to be paid by lessee or rentee to the owner of the tangible personal property. 
(5)  At the rate of one (1) percent of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of services, as defined herein. 
(6)  Sales of use taxes paid to this town on the purchase of new motor trucks and new motor tractors licensed and registered for twelve thousand (12,000) pounds or more, under the provisions of Section 462 or Title 47 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950 (R.S. 47-462), new trailers and new semi-trailers licensed and registered for sixteen thousand (16,000) pounds or more under the provision of said section for rental may be deducted as a credit against the tax due on the rental of that item of property so that no tax is payable on rental income until the tax paid on the purchase price has been exceeded. The sales tax paid to another town on the purchase price of property is not deductible from the tax subsequently due on the rental of such property in this town. Property imported by the lessee for use in this town that has been previously used by him in another town is not subject to any tax on the value when imported, but is only subject to the tax that applies on rental payments. 
     If the tax on rental income fails to exceed the credits for sales or use tax paid, no refund is due the purchaser. 
     A dealer in the town who ordinarily purchases personal property for sale and who withdraws a piece of property from stock for rental is not liable for a sales or use tax on the purchase price of the property when withdrawn from stock. Such person is liable only for the tax applicable on the rental income. 
     Any sales tax paid on any maintenance or operation expenses of a rental business is not deductible as a credit against the tax due on rental income; such expenses are part of the costs of doing business and do not constitute a part of the costs of the identical property being rented.

(f)  Conditions of sale after revocation or termination. 
(1)  If grantee's franchise is lawfully terminated or revoked and the franchising authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. 
(2)  The grantee and the franchising authority agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation or termination of the franchise, the grantee shall be given at least twelve (12) months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. The grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this period. If the grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system during such time that is reasonably acceptable to the franchising authority, the grantee and the franchising authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law. It is further agreed that the grantee's continued operation of the cable system during the twelve-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the franchising authority or the grantee. 
(3)  At the termination or revocation of the franchise, as provided herein, grantee shall, upon notice by the franchising authority, remove at its own expense the cable system from all streets within the service area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grantee may abandon any property in place in the public rights-of-way or public property upon written notice to the franchising authority. If, within ninety (90) days of the receipt of such notice, the franchising authority determines that the safety, appearance, or use of the public rights-of-way would be adversely affected, the property must be removed by the grantee by a date reasonably specified by the franchising authority in light of the amount of work to be performed. 
(Ord. No. 8-2003, Att., § 14, 6-3-03) 
Section 3-3016. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Compliance with state and federal laws. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this franchise to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the state and federal government or any administrative agencies thereof which relate to the conduct of grantee's business. 
(b)  Force majeure. The grantee shall not be held in default under, on in noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which grantee's cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
    Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the franchising authority's intention to subject the grantee to penalties, fine, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers within the franchise territory, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the grantee which outweighs the benefit to be derived by the franchising authority and/or subscribers. 
(c)  Action of parties. In any action by the franchising authority or the grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

CHAPTER 4. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4-2010, adopted June 1, 2010, amended Ch. 4 in its entirety as set out herein. The former Ch. 4 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 5-1998, arts. 1-5, adopted Feb. 3, 1998. 

Section 4-4001. - Statuary authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Louisiana has in L.R.S. 38:84 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the town council of the Town of Amite City does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the Town of Amite City are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(d)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 4-2010, Art. I, 6-1-10) 
Sec. 4-4002. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year-also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

(a)  Lands to which this chapter applies. The chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard with the jurisdiction of the Town of Amite City. 
(b)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana and Incorporated Areas," dated July 22, 2010, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) dated July 22, 2010, and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be; 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(9)  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
(10)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one (1) foot, provided that the community first completes all the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(c)  Permit procedures. 
(1)  Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required:

e.  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with subsection 4-4004(b)(1). 
(2)  Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
d.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
e.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
f.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system; 
g.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwater and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
h.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable; 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
(d)  Variance procedures. 
(1)  The appeal board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgement on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 4-4004(c)(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (subsection 4-4001(c). 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Variances maybe issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(10)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
1.  The criteria outlined in subsection 4-4004(d)(1) through (9) are met; 
2.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 4-4005. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) 4-4003(b), (ii) 4-4004(b)(8), or (iii) 4-4005(c)(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 4-4004(c)(1)a., is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully-enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame-ties-to-ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision, 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or 
4.  In an exisiting manufactured home park or subdivision in which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist lotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites with zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 4-4004(c)(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with subsections 4-4001(b), (c), and (d) of this chapter. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of subsections 4-4003(c), 4-4004(c), and the provisions of [section] 4-4005 of this chapter. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to subsections 4-4003(b) or 4-4004(b)(8) of this chapter. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 4-4003(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified.) 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 4-4004(c) are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(e)  Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 4-4003(b) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 4-4005(e)(1), above, is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 4-4005. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(f)  Severability. If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(g)  Penalties for noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter by constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than sixty (60) days, or both, for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Amite City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Ord. adopted as presented 11-20-81, § 1; Ord. No. 1-1987, § 1, 6-29-87; Ord. No. 2-2001, 1-9-01) 
Section 10-5002. - State laws-Adopted. 
    The amount of license tax levied in each case is hereby fixed, determined and ordained to be the same as that fixed, levied and collectable by the governing authority under, and shall be granted in accordance with, the provisions of Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 47, Sections 341 through 363, both inclusive, as amended, and all other applicable laws, all of which for all purposes of this chapter are made a part hereof by reference as if written herein in extrenso. 
(Ord. adopted as presented 11-20-81, § 2; Ord. No. 1-1987, § 2, 6-29-87; Ord. No. 2-2001, 1-9-01)

Section 10-5004. - Separate license required for each location, based on primary class of business. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, only one (1) license shall be required for each place of business, and the license shall be based upon the classification of business which constitutes the major portion of the taxable annual gross sales and receipts. However, any person operating coin vending or weighting machines shall obtain only one (1) license, regardless of the locations of the machines. However, a separate license shall be required for hotels, motels, rooming houses, and boarding houses. Such license shall be in addition to the license required if other classes of business are operated in conjunction with the hotel, motel, rooming house, or boarding house. 
(b)  In order to calculate the license fee for a business location at which business activities are carried on that fall under more than one (1) tax basis schedule, gross receipts, fees, or commissions for each group of activities falling under each schedule must be compared. The rate for the schedule which constitutes the major portion of the gross receipts, fees, or commission will be used. However, the total gross receipts, fees, or commissions for all business activities carried on at the business location, minus any applicable deductions, are applied to the schedule to compute the fee.

Section 10-5005. - Due and payment dates.

A "change of ownership" occurs when a business is sold or leased, and does not include changes in partnership or corporate shares. 
(b)  The new owner or lessee shall obtain another business license, as the license issued to the former owner or lessee is not transferable or assignable. The license period for the new owner or lessee covers the date of transfer or ownership or lease to December thirty-first of the license year. The collector shall be notified within ten (10) days when a change is effected.

Section 10-5006. - Failure to pay tax; judgment prohibiting future pursuit of business. 
    Failure to pay the tax levied by this chapter shall ipso facto, without demand or putting in default, cause the tax, interest, penalties, and costs to become immediately delinquent, and the collector is hereby vested with authority, on motion in a court of competent jurisdiction, to take a rule on the delinquent taxpayer to show cause in not less than two (2) or more than ten (10) days, exclusive of holidays, why the delinquent taxpayer should not be ordered to pay the total amount due and owing under this chapter. This rule may be tried out of term and in chambers and shall always be tried by preference. If the rule is made absolute, the order therein rendered shall be considered a judgment in favor of the town. 
(Ord. adopted as presented 11-20-81, § 6; Ord. No. 2-2001, 1-9-01) 
Section 10-5007. - Peddlers and itinerant vendors. 
(a)  License fee. All peddlers, hawkers, itinerant vendors, and every person who displays samples, models, goods, wares, or merchandise on a temporary basis in any hotel, motel, store, storehouse, house, vehicle, or any other place, for the purpose of securing orders for the retail sale of such goods, wares, or the like kind or quality, either for immediate or future delivery shall obtain a license based on a fee not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00) provided that an itinerant vendor of agricultural products purchased directly from farmers or an itinerant vendor of seafood products who has either harvested the seafood himself or has purchased the seafood directly from commercial fishermen or shrimpers shall obtain a license based on a flat fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(b)  Exemptions. This section does not apply to the following classes: Those persons making house-house or personal calls displaying samples and taking orders for shipment directly from the manufacturer; those persons making a business call to visit upon the verbal or written invitation of the inhabitant of the premises; those persons, or their representatives, engaged in the business of selling at wholesale, from a fixed place of business in this state, to licensed retail dealers; and vendors, or their agents or vendors, or their agents or representatives, in the sale or deliver of petroleum products when drawn, conveyed, and distributed from a stock maintained at a warehouse, distributing station, or established place of business. 
(c)  Occupational license to be displayed. Parochial and municipal officers shall require all peddlers to exhibit their occupational license. The license shall indicate thereon the motor vehicle license number. They shall seize the merchandise and any vehicle or other conveyance used by the peddler to peddle the same, if the peddler fails or refuses to exhibit his license. All property seized shall be turned over to a court of competent jurisdiction, to be sold according to law, to satisfy the license due and enforce the privilege therefor. The rights of the holder of a chattel mortgage note or any vehicles seized shall not be affected or prejudiced as a result of the seizure. 
(d)  Penalties for violation. Whoever shall sell goods, wares, and merchandise as a peddler without first obtaining the license herein required shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or shall be imprisoned not more than sixty (60) days, or both. 
(e)  Definition of peddler. For the purpose of this chapter, a "peddler" means any person who for himself or any other person, goes from house to house, or place to place, or store to store, exposing and selling the merchandise which he carries with him and delivering the same at the time of or immediately after the sale or without returning to the base of business operation between the taking of the order and the delivery of the goods; however, any person who uses the same vehicle or a combination of one (1) or more vehicles for the purpose of taking orders and delivering merchandise, regardless of the fact that the vehicle returns to the base of operations between the taking of the order and the delivery of the merchandise, shall be deemed a peddler, unless such person can show that the merchandise delivered is accompanied by an invoice or delivery ticket prepared at the base of operations and which conforms to the original order and that the person delivering the merchandise has permitted no deviation from the original order by allowing the purchaser to reject, cancel, increase, or decrease the quantity at the time of delivery or to offset against such quantity any merchandise delivered at a prior time which is being returned. This extension of the meaning of the term "peddler" shall not be interpreted so as to prevent rejection or cancellation of bona fide orders or the return of inferior merchandise, but shall be construed so as to prevent persons peddling merchandise from escaping their tax liability by subterfuge through means of so-called "standing order" or blanket advance orders, increase and decrease in quantities at the time of delivery, arbitrary rejections and cancellations, and offset of merchandise returned by reason of nonsale rather than obligation of warranty, all of which are hereby declared to be mere devices to prevent normal methods of operations so as to disguise the business of a peddler as an ordinary wholesale business. Peddler shall include but is not limited to hawkers, itinerant vendors, and any retail dealers not having a fixed place of business.

    Any business engaged in renting, leasing, or licensing immovable property of less than fifty (50) units shall not be subject to the occupational license tax. 
(Ord. No. 4-2000, 1-4-00) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4-2000, adopted Jan. 4, 2000, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of its provisions as § 10-5008 herein was at the discretion of the editor. 
Section 10-5009. - Compliance with local sales tax laws required. 
(a)  In order to obtain an occupational license from the Town of Amite City as required by this section, each applicant shall, if currently doing business, each year submit with each application for renewal of an occupational license and the payment of the occupational license tax a certificate issued from the Tangipahoa Parish School Board and its sales tax collection office declaring that the applicant has, as of December 31 of the preceding year, submitted all sales tax reports, paid all sales taxes due and paid any and all penalties and interest due in connection with sales tax collections.

PART 11 - CRIMES, OFFENSES AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
CHAPTER 1. - IN GENERAL 

Section 11-1001. - Definitions. 
    In this part the terms enumerated shall have the designated meanings: 
    Another refers to any person or legal entity, including the State of Louisiana or any subdivision thereof. 
    Anything of value must be given the broadest possible construction, including any conceivable thing of the slightest value, movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, public or private. It must be construed in the broad popular sense of the phrase, and not necessarily as synonymous with the traditional legal term "property." 
    Dangerous weapon includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm. 
    Foreseeable refers to that which ordinarily would be anticipated by a human being of average reasonable intelligence and perception. 
    Person includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not. 
    Property refers to both public and private property movable and immovable, and corporeal and incorporeal property. 
    Public officer, public office, public employee, or position of public authority, means and applies to any executive, ministerial, administrative, judicial, or legislative officer, office, employee or position of authority respectively, of the State of Louisiana or any parish, municipality, district, or other political subdivision thereof, or of any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state, parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    State means the State of Louisiana, or any parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision thereof, or any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state, parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    Town means the Town of Amite City or any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the town. 
    Whoever in a penalty clause refers only to natural persons insofar as imprisonment is provided, but insofar as a fine may be imposed "whoever" in a penalty clause refers to any person. 
Section 11-1002. - Interpretation. 
    The sections of this part cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision. 
Section 11-1003. - Civil remedies not affected. 
    Nothing in this part shall affect any civil remedy provided by the law pertaining to civil matters, or any legal power to inflict penalties for contempt. 
Section 11-1004. - Crime defined; punishment. 
(a)  A crime is that conduct which is defined as criminal in this chapter. 
(b)  If punishment is not specifically provided for, it shall be as provided in section 1-1008 of this Code. 
Section 11-1005. - Criminal conduct. 
    Criminal conduct consists of: 
(1)  an act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences, and which is combined with criminal intent; or 
(2)  a mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences, where there is no requirement of criminal intent; or 
(3)  criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. 
Section 11-1006. - Criminal consequences. 
    Criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this part as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein. 
Section 11-1007. - Criminal intent. 
    Criminal intent may be specific or general: 
(1)  Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. 
(2)  General criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent, and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender, in the ordinary course of human experience, must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act. 
Section 11-1008. - Criminal intent; how expressed. 
    The definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent, while in others no intent is required. Some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. However, in the absence of qualifying provisions, the terms "intent" and "intentional" have reference to "general criminal intent." 
Section 11-1009. - Criminal negligence. 
    Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances. 
Section 11-1010. - Insanity. 
    If the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease or a mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility. 
Section 11-1011. - Intoxication. 
    The fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial, except as follows: 
(1)  Where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary, and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime, the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility. 
(2)  Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime. 
Section 11-1012. - Mistake of fact. 
    Unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime, reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime. 
Section 11-1013. - Mistake of law. 
    Ignorance of the provision of this part is not a defense to any criminal prosecution. However, mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow, is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Where the offender reasonably relied on an act of this municipality in repealing an existing criminal provision, or in otherwise purporting to make the offender's conduct lawful; or 
(2)  Where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional. 
Section 11-1014. - Justification; general provisions. 
    The fact that an offender's conduct is justifiable, although otherwise criminal, shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct. This defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances: 
(1)  When the offender's conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office; or 
(2)  When the offender's conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful under the laws of the State of Louisiana or of this chapter; or 
(3)  When for any reason the offender's conduct is authorized by law; or

CHAPTER 10. - AMITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Section 12-10001. - Creation.

(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08) 
Section 12-10002. - Administration. 
    The economic development district guidelines will be administered by the Town of Amite City with variance requests reviewed by the Amite Zoning Commission, acting in their capacity as board of adjustments. 
(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08) 
Section 12-10003. - Location. 
    The economic development district is bounded on the east by Duncan Avenue; on the west by Second Street; on the south by Palmetto Street and on the north by Olive Street.

(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08) 
Section 12-10004. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of creating this AEDD overlay district is to: 
    Encourage investment and restoration of property in a manner that values preservation of historic structures while enhancing property values; 
    Provide predictability and conformity in zoning designations with relation to the character of the adjoining properties and neighborhoods; 
    Provide for a set of optional development and preservation incentives to be used by the town as a negotiating and incentive tool; 
    Provide for the adoption of an amended zoning use for this district. 
(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08)

(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08) 
Section 12-10006. - Incentive tools.

    Endorsement of the state's enterprise zone program, providing for a state tax credit for each new employee hired or retained. In addition, state and local sales taxes paid for construction materials and equipment can be refunded to the owner/developer if minimum state guidelines are met. 
    Historic structure federal and state income tax credits, if such eligible structures are recognized as historic by the Louisiana Office of Historic Preservation. 
    The town may negotiate to have paved parking placed in the rear and sides of residential buildings to provide additional green space in the front of such buildings. 
    Parking requirements may be reduced by up to twenty (20) percent of the number of spaces required if health and safety are not adversely affected and if a property owner is trying to meet the AEDD guidelines. 
    Free technical assistance provided by the Town of Amite and the Tangipahoa Parish Economic Development Foundation. 
    The town may install new public sidewalks, at a shared cost with the property owner, depending upon the current town budget and sidewalk plans, to be completed in conjunction with proposed private property improvements. 
    Historic properties being renovated may apply for façade grants made available to the town through the Louisiana Office of Historic Preservation. 
(Ord. No. 8-2008, 8-23-08) 
Section 12-10007. - Minimum standards to be followed.

ZONING ORDINANCE
TOWN OF AMITE CITY, LOUISIANA
An ordinance establishing the comprehensive zoning regulations for the Town of Amite
City, Louisiana, and providing for the administration, enforcement and amendment thereof, in
accordance with the provisions of the authority granted by Title 33, Section 4721-4729 Louisiana
Revised Statutes as amended.
ADOPTION
Whereas the Board of Aldermen deems it necessary for the purpose of promoting the
health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the town and its residents to enact such an ordinance;
and the Board of Aldermen has appointed a zoning commission to recommend the boundaries of
the various original districts and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein. The Zoning
Commission has divided the town into districts and has prepared regulations pertaining to such
districts in accordance with a comprehensive plan designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to
prevent overcrowding of land; to secure safety from fire, panic, and provide adequate light and
air; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provisions of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements.
The Zoning Commission has given reasonable consideration, among other things, to the
character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, with a view to
conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout
the town. The Zoning Commission has made a preliminary report to the Board of Aldermen.
The Board has given due public notice of hearings relating to zoning districts, regulations, and
restrictions.
All requirements of Title 33, Section 4721-4729 Louisiana Revised Statutes with regard
to the preparation of the report of the Zoning Commission and the subsequent action of the
Board of Aldermen have been met.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED on this 6th day of August, 1985, BY THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE TOWN OF AMITE CITY, LOUISIANA, AS AN
ORDINANCE:
1
PART I - PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES
The following principles and objectives are the basis for the requirements in this ordinance; they
are not requirements themselves. Individual petitioners should consider them as the "spirit" of
the ordinance.
SECTION 1.1 GENERAL
1.101 It is the desire of the commission to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, our
drainage system into a structure for open space. Acceptable uses, other than drainage,
include (a) agriculture, (b) recreation not requiring structures, (c) parks, (d) scenic
drives, (e) nature areas.
1.102 Use changes should not occur in the center of a street or road with the possible
exception of freeways built with controlled access. Changes at the rear property line
would be optimum. Zone changes at the side property line should occur when there is
only minimal change in use.
1 .103 All recognized historical and archaeological sites and facilities should be preserved.
1.104 Sites with unique natural beauty should be preserved for public enjoyment.
1.105 The Town of Amite City has formally adopted an Amite Historic Preservation District,
which governs all private property, buildings, appurtenances, structures, areas, signs,
etc. within the District. Reference can be made to the Town of Amite City Code of
Ordinances, Section 12, Chapter 7, Amite Historic Preservation District, and adopted
December 6, 1994.
SECTION 1.2 HOUSING
1.201 It is possible, with certain modifying criteria, to mix housing densities.
1.202 It is unfeasible and unwise to mix economic groups except in the most urban precincts.
1.203 Preference should be given to higher density residential (apartments, mobile home
parks, town houses, etc.) on major streets (arterial or collector).
1.204 Single-family residential lots should be served by local streets.
Normally, they should be discouraged on collector and arterial streets.
1.205 Non-farm strip residential development should not be allowed along major roads and
highways in rural areas.
1.206 No urban or suburban residential development should be allowed unless there is an
acceptable supply of potable water, sewerage collection and treatment, solid waste
collection and disposal, and fire and police protection.
1.207 All urban and suburban residential development should have immediate access to
2
community recreation facilities.
1.208 No residential development should be allowed in flood ways. Development in flood
plains should be in conformity with floodplain controls.
1.209 No commercial uses should be allowed in residential areas except as a part of a Planned
Unit Development.
1.210 No residential development should be allowed within the 100 dba curve of an airport.
1.211 Residential uses are compatible with such uses as: recreation, education, fire and police
substations, some agriculture, some institutions.
1.212 Residential uses are incompatible with: commercial and industrial uses, all
transportation facilities.
SECTION 1.3 COMMERCIAL
1.301 All commercial activities should be in enclaves varying in size to suit their function and
located convenient to their market. All should have adequate off-street parking. Strip
commercial should be prohibited on all streets.
1.302 Commercial activities should have access to arterial and collector streets only.
1.303 Commercial uses should be given prime consideration at the intersection of two arterial
streets.
1.304 Commercial, along with some industrial and transportation uses, should be given prime
consideration at all four-way major interchanges on freeways.
1.305 Only small convenience centers and some offices should be allowed on collector streets.
1.306 Offices generating continuing traffic (doctors and dentists, banks, etc.) should be
allowed on arterial streets only.
1.307 Auto oriented commercial (with the possible exception of convenience food stores)
should be allowed only on arterials and at freeway interchanges.
1.308 Uses compatible with commercial are: medium and high density housing; institutions
such as hospitals, colleges and universities, research organizations; high schools;
administrative community facilities; agriculture.
1.309 Uses incompatible with commercial: heavy and most light industry; low-density
housing; community facilities such as correctional and industrial types; elementary and
junior high schools.
1.310 Wholesale and warehouse uses are more compatible with industrial and transportation
uses than with other forms of commercial.
3
SECTION 1.4 INDUSTRIAL
1.401 All industry should be grouped in compatible enclaves.
1.402 All industry must be served by heavy motor transport and should be restricted to sites
on arterial streets or freeways.
1.403 Most heavy industry and some light industry should be served by rail transportation.
Sites over 1/4 mile from existing rail facilities should prove economically doubtful for
industrial development.
1.404 Most heavy and some light industry must be located adjacent to navigable waterways
for transportation or process water.
1.405 Many industrial uses live well in the environs of commercial airfields. They should be
encouraged.
1.406 Labor-intensive industry should be located convenient to its labor market.
1.407 Uses compatible with industrial uses are: transportation and warehouse uses; some
commercial uses; agriculture; community facilities of an industrial type; airfields.
1.408 Uses incompatible with industrial uses are: residential; some commercial: educational;
most community facilities; most recreational uses.
SECTION 1.5 INSTITUTIONS
1 .501 Institutional uses are so diverse that they demand relationships related to their
characteristics.
a. Hospitals create traffic and parking problems that can only be acceptable on
arterial streets. They are most compatible with commercial and high density
residential uses.
b. Nursing and long-term care facilities create much less demand in circulation
and parking and could be accommodated on collector streets. Medium and highdensity
housing and agricultural uses are compatible.
c. Schools should be related to age of student and the amount of traffic generated.
Elementary schools: residential areas, local streets. High and vocational schools:
commercial or residential areas, collector streets or greater. Colleges, etc.: high
density residential or commercial, arterial streets.
d. Churches: High density residential or commercial, mostly arterial streets.
4
SECTION 1.6 AGRICULTURE AND WOODLANDS
1 .601 Should be encouraged and protected in areas where the soil is suitable.
SECTION 1.7 RECREATION
1.701 Utilize drainage areas in residential areas for recreational purposes.
1.702 There should be some recreational area in every residential section.
1.703 Regional recreation facilities should be served by arterial roads.
1.704 Prime natural areas should be provided for public use in perpetuity. (Purchase in fee
simply or purchase development rights.)
SECTION 1.8 TRANSPORTATION
1.801 Adopt, implement, and maintain a major road plan at all times.
1.802 Every land use should contain enough land to insure off-street parking for its function.
SECTION 1.9 UTILITIES
1.901 Allow no use (except for commercial farm) where a full range of approved utilities
(electricity gas, water, phone, sewerage, solid waste) are not available.
1.902 Most utility facilities are more compatible with industrial uses.
1.903 Utility uses that must occur in residential areas should be suitably buffered and
landscaped.

shall be made in this official zoning map periodically, after the amendment has been
approved by the City Council. Each such change of the map shall be dated, signed, and
certified. However, amendments shall become effective when adopted by the Council.
No change of any nature shall be made in this official zoning map or matter shown
thereon except in conformity with the procedure set forth in this ordinance. Any
unauthorized changes of whatever kind, by any person or persons, shall be considered a
violation of the ordinance and punishable under Part 4.4 of this ordinance.

PART 5 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
SECTION 5.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Off-street parking facilities for one-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on
the same lot or plot of ground as the building to be served. The location of off-street
parking facilities for other uses shall not be more than 300 feet distance, provided,
however, that the zoning classification for such land is the same or less restrictive than
the classification of the lot upon which the main use is located.
Such parking space to be used in conjunction with the principal use shall be reserved as
such through an encumbrance of the title of the property to be designated as a required
parking space, such encumbrance to be valid for the total period of the use or uses for
which the parking is needed are in existence.
Such agreement or covenant shall be duly recorded in the office of the City Clerk and a
certificate furnished the Building Inspector. Such parking space shall be surfaced with a
minimum of four inches of concrete or similar all-weather surface and such entrances
shall be similarly surfaced.
5.101 Parking requirements for two or more uses of the same or different type may be
satisfied by the allocation of a common or collective parking facility. Such facility shall
not be less than the same requirements for the individual uses computed separately.
5.102 Area reserved for off-street parking or loading in accordance with the provisions of this
34
section shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use
which it serves is discontinued or modified except where equivalent off-street parking
or loading space is provided.
5.103 For uses not mentioned in this section, the requirements for off-street parking and
loading facilities for a similar use specifically mentioned in this section shall apply.
5.104 Parking space is an area on a lot sufficient in size to store one vehicle. This space shall
not (except as hereafter noted) be less than nine (9) feet in width and twenty (20) feet in

COMMENT: By definition, a condominium has common areas and facilities, and there is an
association of owners organized for the purpose of maintaining, administering and operating
the common areas and facilities. It is a legal form of ownership of real estate and not a
specific building style. The purchaser has title to his or her interior space in the building and
an undivided interest in parts of the interior, the exterior, and other common elements. The
property is identified in a master deed and recorded on a plat with the local jurisdiction. The
common elements usually include the land underneath and surrounding the building, certain

resistant walls.
COMMENT: Town houses usually have separate utilities such as individual hot water and
heating systems, separate electric meters, etc. However, in some condominium situations,
the condominium association may arrange for bulk purchase of certain utilities and distribute
them to individual dwelling units. Consequently, the definition normally would not contain a
requirement for separate utility systems.

for the use by the public, a corporation, or another person or entity.

is rapidly becoming blurred. The major objection to fast food restaurants came from the
adverse impacts including high traffic, glare, garish design, litter, and noise. Often they
became hangouts. With stringent performance standards, these problems can be controlled,

restaurants.
