MALVERN,ARKANSAS - MUNICIPAL 
CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of  
the City of Malvern,Arkansas 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7,  
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
    The Malvern, Arkansas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been 
kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by 
regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of 
Book Publishing Company. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering 
system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing 
provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. 
Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are 
numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to 
accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal 
expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the 
provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, 
following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in 
the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code 
Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by 
individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance No. 2016-20 passed 
December 12, 2016.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city 
employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important 
elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses 
a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. 
It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is 
represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 
of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code 
contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain 
ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated 
by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the 
chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters 
which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without 
renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, can be added between Chapter 2.04, and 
Chapter 2.08 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by 
"tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the 
beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has 
its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying 
ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. 
(Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected 
sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. 
These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing 
at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are 
applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older 
or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, 
under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code 
Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and 
Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in 
the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition 
of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 
6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as 
budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some 
reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not 
codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or 
"(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and 
Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added 
for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological 
listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List 
specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the 
code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can 
locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an 
alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references 
where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX  
Fee 5.04.030  
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction 
Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in 
that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must 
be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. 
Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement 
No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". 
(Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed 
double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if 
at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have 
a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a 
diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent 
nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general 
and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be

9.80.010 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
(a)	A thing is "obscene" if, by contemporary community standards, and considered as a whole, its 
predominant appeal is to prurient interest. 
(b)	"Prurient interest" is defined as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, which 
goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such 
matters. If it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination 
that the subject matter is designed for, or directed to a specially susceptible audience, the 
subject matter shall be judged with reference to such audience. For the purpose of Section 
9.80.070, when the subject matter is distributed or exhibited to minors under eighteen years of 
age, the subject matter shall be judged with reference to an average person in the community of 
the actual age of the minor to whom such material is distributed, or exhibited. In all other cases, 
the subject matter shall be judged with reference to the average person in the community. 
(c)	"Matter" means any book, magazine, newspaper, or other printed or written material or any 
picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture, play, night club performance, television 
production, or other pictorial representation, of any statute or other figure, or any recording, 
transcription or mechanical, chemical or electrical reproduction or any other articles, equipment, 
machines or materials. 
(d)	"Person" means any individual, partnership, firm, association, corporation or other legal entity. 
(e)	"Distribute" means to transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration, by any 
means. 
(f)	"Knowingly" means having actual or constructive knowledge of the obscene contents of the 
subject matter. A person has constructive knowledge of the obscene contents, if he has 
knowledge of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent man on notice as to the suspect 
nature of the material, and the failure to inspect the contents is either for the purpose of 
avoiding such disclosure or is due to reckless conduct. 
(g)	"Reckless conduct" is conduct which consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk 
that matter may be obscene. The risk may be of such a nature and degree that, considering the 
nature and purpose of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard 
involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an average law-abiding person 
would observe in the actor's situation under like circumstances. 
(Ord. 706 §1, 1973). 


9.80.020 - Persons exempt—Affirmative defense. 
    This chapter shall not apply to persons who may possess or distribute obscene matter or participate 
in conduct otherwise prescribed by this chapter when such possession, distribution or conduct ocurs in 
the course of law enforcement activities, or in the course of bona fide scientific, educational, or 
comparable research or study, or like circumstances of justification. If this issue is not presented by the 
prosecution's evidence, the defendant may raise the same as an affirmative defense by presenting some 
evidence thereon. When raised, the prosecution must sustain the burden of proving the defendant guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt as to that issue. 
(Ord. 706 §2, 1973). 


9.80.030 - Jury trial. 
    Criminal prosecutions and other proceedings involving the ultimate issue of obscenity (as 
distinguished from the issue of "probable cause") shall be tried by jury if in circuit court, unless both 
parties to the action waive a jury trial in writing or by statement in open court, entered in the minutes, with 
the approval of the court. In municipal or other courts the ultimate issue of obscenity shall be by the trier 
of such fact. 
(Ord. 706 §3, 1973). 


9.80.040 - Function of jury and court in obscenity trial. 
(a)	The jury represents a cross-section of the community and has a special aptitude for expressing the 
view of the average person. 
    As the trier of fact, it is the exclusive judge of the common conscience of the community and the 
embodiment of community standards. 
(b)	Where a jury question is presented, i.e., that reasonable men may differ whether the subject matter 
or conduct is obscene, the trial court shall have no power either before, during, or after trial to 
dismiss an obscenity proceeding on the ground that the subject matter, or conduct, is not obscene as 
a matter of law, nor may an appellate court after trial set aside an obscenity verdict on the same 
grounds if an examination of the evidence indicates the verdict is supported by sufficient evidence. 
(c)	Any dismissal by the trial court on such grounds is appealable by the city or any interested citizen of 
Malvern. 
(Ord. 706 §4, 1973). 


9.80.050 - Presumption of knowledge of standards.

the jury or trier of fact may declare to be obscene.

or building contractors digging or cutting into the streets of Malvern will be required to get a street

enabling the use of intersections by pedestrians and driveways by residents located on streets where 
work is in progress. As a protection to traffic and pedestrians, barricades or dirt excavated shall be 
maintained adjacent to the excavation. When work concerned is a public hazard, signs signifying the 
same shall be exhibited. Amber lights or flares shall be maintained on excavation from dusk to daybreak. 
Such equipment shall be located at each end and along the entire length of the excavation. Unless lights

for and obtaining a permit hereunder, shall immediately take proper emergency measures to cure or 
remedy the dangerous condition for the protection of property, life, health and safety of individuals.

    No subdivision or new utility facility shall place water and sewer, gas or power lines under the 
pavement except for necessary street crossings. Any continuous longitudinal cut of more than fifty feet or 
five or more cuts in a single block shall be treated as a block permit with minimum fee of one hundred 
dollars plus the cost of repair. In connection with block cuts, if in the opinion of the street superintendent's 
and mayor's offices said cuts substantially reduce the anticipated life of the street surface, they may 
require that the utility company involved resurface the entire block or some lesser portion thereof so that 
the entire surface shall be restored to substantially the same condition it was in prior to the time said cuts 
were made. In making this determination the street superintendent and mayor shall take into 
consideration the age of the existing surface involved. When in the opinion of the street superintendent 
and the mayor the volume of paving cuts requested by a utility company exceeds the city's ability to repair 
the same within a reasonable period of time, the city of Malvern may, at its option, submit the repair work 
to public bid of the lowest responsible bidder and in such event shall charge the utility company 
concerned the actual cost of said repair together with the permit fees involved.

encourage development that will be sound for many years. Such development insures: 
(1)	Safety, service, and stable property values for the home owner; 
(2)	Economy of maintenance for the city and utility companies; 
(3)	Uniform minimum standards for all developers; 
(4)	Fair distribution of taxes.

criticism. After the plat has been checked against the design standards as adopted by the planning 
commission the plat requirements of this title, and the review of other agencies, the planning commission 
shall approve the plat or disapprove it with reasons in writing within thirty days of the first regular meeting 
after it is received.

before the regular meeting of the planning commission the subdivider shall file six copies of the final plat 
with the planning commission. The original shall be drawn in India ink on a sheet of tracing linen at a 
scale of one inch equals one hundred feet. 
(Ord. 602 §2(part), 1960). 


18.08.060 - Review and approval of final plat. 
    After checking the final plat against the approved preliminary plat and the certificates of approval for

made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise 
established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. 
Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient 
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the 
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(1)	In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be 
required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, 
except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure 
would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone;

distance of not less than two thousand one hundred feet from each end of the runways, no 
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height 
above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limits 
prescribed for such noninstrument approach zone. 
    Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to 
permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits 
established by this title except as set forth in Chapter 19.12. 
(Ord. 635 §7(a), 1965).

thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for 
such permit shall be granted. 
(Ord. 635 §7(b), 1965).

deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(Ord. 635 §7(c), 1965).

of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found 
that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or

Chapter 20.20 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION* 
Sections: 


20.20.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in Arkansas Act 1969, Act No. 629, delegated the 
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
Therefore, the Malvern city council of the city of Malvern, Arkansas, does ordain as set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1003 §1(A), 1987). 


20.20.020 - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The flood hazard areas of the city of Malvern are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss 
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, 
and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the 
public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an 
increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses 
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, 
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 1003 §1(B), 1987). 


20.20.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Protect human life and health; 
(2)	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)	Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone 
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)	Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 1003 §1(C), 1987). 


20.20.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or 
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, 
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or 
which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(6)	Require that no construction will occur on any home or commercial structure with the floor lower 
than the 100-year-flood elevation plus one (1) foot. 
(Ord. 01-22 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1094 §4, 1993; Ord. 1003 §1(D), 1987). 


20.20.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted 
to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable 
application. 
(1)	"Appeal" means a request for a review of this floodplain administrator's interpretation of any 
provision of this chapter or request for a variance. 
(2)	"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood 
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to 
an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the 
path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is 
characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
(3)	"Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a 
one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as 
Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been 
completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, 
AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
(4)	"Base flood" means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in 
any given year. 
(5)	"Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, 
without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
(6)	"Development" means any manmade change in improved or unimproved real estate, including 
but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, 
excavation or drilling operations. 
(7)	"Elevated building" means a nonbasement building (i) built, in the case of building in Zones A1-
30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a 
building structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of 
pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) 
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of 
up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, 
D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation 
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In 
the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise 
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means 
of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the 
National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
(8)	"Existing construction" means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the 
"start of construction" commenced before the effected date of the FIRM or before January 1, 
1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as 
"existing structures." 
(9)	"Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation 
of normally dry land areas from: 
(A)	The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(B)	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(10)	"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood 
hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
(11)	"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base 
flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map. 
(12)	"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water 
from any source (see definition of flooding). 
(13)	"Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been 
authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify 
flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood 
hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes 
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying 
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
(14)	"Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the 
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without 
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
(15)	"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it 
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only for docking facilities, 
port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and 
shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related 
manufacturing facilities. 
(16)	"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to 
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
(17)	"Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and 
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the 
flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
(18)	"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and 
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and 
operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
(19)	"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An 
unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or 
storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; 
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the 
applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance 
Program regulations. 
(20)	"Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on 
a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when 
connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term 
"manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed 
on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes the 
term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar 
vehicles. 
(21)	"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National 
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown 
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
(22)	"New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start 
of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of flood- plain management regulation 
adopted by a community. 
(23)	"Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the 
Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348))," means and includes substantial improvement 
and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, 
repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of 
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a 
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the 
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a 
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land 
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include excavation for basement, 
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the 
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as 
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
(24)	"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is 
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
(25)	"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the 
cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either (1) 
before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is 
being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition "substantial 
improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other 
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external 
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for 
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code 
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of 
a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic 
Places. 
(26)	"Variance" means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when 
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits 
construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full 
requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
(27)	"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the 
community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the 
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such 
time as that documentation is provided. 
(28)	"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum 
(NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and 
frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
(Ord. 1003 §2, 1987). 


20.20.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of 
Malvern. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(A), 1987). 


20.20.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a 
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Malvern," dated 
January 22, 1982, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps 
(FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this 
chapter. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(B), 1987). 


20.20.080 - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(C), 1987). 


20.20.090 - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full 
compliance with the terms of the chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(D), 1987). 


20.20.100 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or 
deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance conflict or overlap, whichever 
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(E), 1987). 


20.20.110 - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: (1) considered as 
minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to 
limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(F), 1987). 


20.20.120 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory 
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can 
and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not 
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free 
from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any 
official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any 
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. 1003 §3(G), 1987). 


20.20.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
    The code enforcement officer is appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement 
the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance 
Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. 
(Ord. 1003 §4(A), 1987). 


20.20.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the 
following: 
(1)	Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this 
chapter;

from flood-ing; 
(3)	Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of the 
ordinance codified in this chapter; 
(4)	Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been 
obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 for the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior 
approval is required; 
(5)	Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special 
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary 
and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation; 
(6)	Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency, which is 
the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Committee, prior to any alteration or relocation of a 
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency; 
(7)	Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse 
is maintained; 
(8)	When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 20.20.070, 
the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation 
data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the 
provisions of Sections 20.20.170 through 20.20.210; 
(9)	When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require 
that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall 
be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated 
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing 
and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood 
more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(Ord. 1003 §4(B), 1987). 


20.20.150 - Permit procedures. 
(a)	Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms 
furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale 
showing the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and 
proposed structures, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. 
Additionally, the following information is required: 
(1)	Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and 
substantially improved structures; 
(2)	Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be 
floodproofed; 
(3)	A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential 
floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of Section 20.20.180(2); 
(4)	Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or 
relocated as a result of proposed development; 
(5)	Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Section 20.20.140(1). 
(b)	Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of 
the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
(1)	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)	The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)	The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including 
maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, 
gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(8)	The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(9)	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the 
proposed use; 
(10)	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(Ord. 1003 §4(C), 1987). 


20.20.160 - Variance procedures. 
(a)	The board of zoning adjustment as established by the Malvern city council shall hear and render 
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)	The board of zoning adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged 
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator 
in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)	Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning adjustment may appeal such 
decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)	The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report 
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to 
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)	Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot 
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures 
constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 20.20-.150(b) have 
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification 
required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)	Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the board of zoning 
adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further 
the purpose and objectives of this chapter. (See Section 20.20.030). 
(h)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during 
the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)	Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)	Variances shall only by issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)	Variances shall only be issued upon (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination 
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a 
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional 
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or 
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)	Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will 
be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that 
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the 
reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)	Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for 
other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the 
criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (i) of this section are met, and (ii) the structure or other 
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create 
no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. 1003 §4(D), 1987). 


20.20.170 - Construction—General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and 
substantial improvements: 
(1)	All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and 
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting 
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)	All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and 
practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)	All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to 
flood dam-age; 
(4)	All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, 
ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are 
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the 
components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)	All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate 
infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate 
infiltration of flood- waters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; 
and, 
(7)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination 
from them during flooding. 
(Ord. 1003 §5(A), 1987). 


20.20.180 - Construction—Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth 
in (i) Section 20.20-.070, (ii) Section 20.20.140(8) or (iii) Section 20.20-.190(D), the following provisions 
are required: 
(1)	Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential 
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood 
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a 
certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in 
Section 20.20-.150(a)(1) is satisfied. 
(2)	Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any 
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor 
(including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility 
and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight 
with walls sub-stantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components 
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A 
registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, 
specifications and plans for the construction are in accordance with accepted standards of 
practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific 
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be 
maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)	Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below 
the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize 
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional 
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(A)	A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for 
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(B)	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
(C)	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices 
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)	Manufactured Homes. 
(A)	Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A shall be installed using 
methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, 
manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral 
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or 
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local 
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(B)	All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subdivision (1) of this section. 
(C)	Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones 
A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM be elevated on a permanent foundation such 
that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; and 
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the 
provision of this subdivision. 
(Ord. 1003 §5(B), 1987). 


20.20.190 - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)	All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent 
with Sections 20.20-.020, 20.20.030 and 20.20.040 of this chapter. 
(b)	All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and 
subdivisions, shall meet development permit requirements of Sections 20.20.080, 20.20.150 and 
20.20.170 through 20.20.210 of this chapter. 
(c)	Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than fifty lots or 
five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 20.20.070 or 
20.20.140(8). 
(d)	All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate 
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)	All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public 
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to 
minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. 1003 §5(C), 1987). 


20.20.200 - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 20.20.070, are areas 
designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood 
depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding 
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or 
sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest 
floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the 
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is 
specified); 
(2)	All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
(A)	Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at 
least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two 
feet if no depth number is specified), or 
(B)	Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base 
flood level the structure is watertight with walls subtantially impermeable to the passage of 
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and 
hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy; 
(3)	A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain 
administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 20.20.150(a)(1) are 
satisfied. 
(4)	Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide 
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 1003 §5(D), 1987). 


20.20.210 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 20.20.070 are areas designated 
as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which 
carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)	Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and 
other development unless certification by a professional registered engineer or architect is 
provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within 
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)	If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements 
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 20.20.170 through 
20.20.210. 
(Ord. 1003 §5(E), 1987).

Art. F-1 PURPOSES AND AUTHORITY
The zoning and subdivision regulations as herein set forth have been made in accordance with

with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of each district and its
peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view of conserving the value of buildings and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the City. Subdivision regulations have
been developed to assure a coordinated street system and quality development of new living areas

paragraphs, clauses, parts or positions.
l. 7 Amendments
These regulations may be amended at any time after the Planning Commission has
1ield a-publicilearing on the proposed amendments. At, on, or after such public
-1-
1.8
hearing, the Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council the
adoption of such amendments.
Types of Subdivisions
A General - Recognizing thai subdivision regulations must be applied to
various land development types, and because of the special conditions
pertaining to each, this regulation hereby provides for the establishment of
four subdivision types: CommerciaVOffice, Industrial, Manufactured Home
Park/Subdivisions and Residential
B. Prior to the approval of any preliminary plat, the Planning Commission
shall classify and evaluate each subdivision according to its planned future
use, it being the responsibility of the applicant to identify the type of
proposed plat. Where a proposed plat incorporates more than one use of
the type specified in this Section, either the different land use types shall be
clearly delineated on the submitted plat, or separate plats shall be filed for
each land use type together with a scale drawing illustrating the proposed
layout as a totality.
C. The purpose and intent of each subdivision type shall be generally as
follows:
l. Commercial/Office Subdivisions - Commercial/Office Subdivisions
are intended to accommodate one or more commercial building
sites on either single or multiple lots in a carefully planned
configuration designed to protect and enhance the viability of each
separate structure and ownership. Commercial and office uses shall
be those defined by the Planning Commission.
2. Industrial Subdivisions - Industrial subdivisions are intended to
fulfill a two-fold objective; to provide both opportunity and flexibility
for industrial activities to take place at appropriate locations
in a compatible manner with adjacent nonmanufacturing areas; to
acquire the application of sound design principles and the orderly
development of industrial parcels involving the creation of one or
more building sites or lots. Industrial uses shall be defined as such
in the Malvern Zoning Ordinance.
3. Manufactured Home Park/ Subdivisions - Manufactured home
parkinmd rubdivisions--areintended to ensure-proper layout filld
development of areas for manufactured home occupancy by establishing
appropriate standards for density spacing and placement and
-by-requiring eff'-Streetparlcing, ;;torage facilities and -Open space.
-2-
1.9
The regulations are also intended to facilitate location of
manufactured homes within the jurisdiction of this subdivision
ordinance by making available appropriate sites for such occupancy.
4. Residential Subdivisions - Residential subdivisions are intend.ed to
ensure efficient, aesthetic and convenient designs for single family,
zero-lot-line, duplex and multi-family residential development, and
to provide hannonious relationships with surrounding areas.
Residential uses shall be those defined as such in the Malvern
Zoning Ordinance.
Resubdivision of Land
A Procedure - Any change in an approved or recorded plat other than lot
splits, lot line adjustments or recombinations shall be considered a
resubdivision and subject to approval by the Planning Commission. For
resubdivision, the same rules, regulations and procedures applicable to
subdivisions shall apply.
B. Future Resubdivisions - Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the
subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of
land, and there are indications of such lots eventually being resubdivided
into small building sites the Planniog Colllmission may require that such
parcel ofland allow for the future opening of streets and 1he ultimate
extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening
and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
1.10 Vacation of Plats
A Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner at any time
before the sale of any lot therein. Vacation of a plat shall be subject to the
approval of the City Council. The City Council may reject any proposed
plat vacation which abridges or destroys any public rights in any public use
areas, improvements, streets or alleys.
B. Upon recordation, such vacation shall have the effect of divesting the
public of all rights in the streets, alleys, public areas, and dedications laid
out for describing in such plat, except those reserved by such vacation.
C. When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner estab-
1isheu1:herein;iirovided the uwnersllf1lll lotsjoin 1he plat vacation application.
1 ;.J.1 -Variances
-3-
A General - The rules and regulations set forth in tbis regulation are the
standard reqillrements of the City_ Vihere the Planning Commission finds,
however, that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, or the purpose of these
regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it
may approve variances to the subdivision regulations so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secured_ Such variances,
however, shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations_ The Planning Commission shall only approve variances
where it finds that:
1. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property.
2. The conditions upon which the request for variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally to other properties.
3 Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, strict application
of these regulations would deprive the owner of reasonable
use of his property.
4. The variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, the Master Street Plan, or the Municipal Plan.
5 The variance is not based solely on financial considerations, but has
other overriding hardships.
B. Procedures and Conditions -No variance shall be granted except upon
written petition by the subdivider when the preliminary plat is filed for consideration
by the Planning Commission. The petition shall state fully the
grounds for the application and all of the facts upon which the petition is
made. In approving variances, the Planning Commission, may, at its
option, reqillre special conditions to ensure development in accordance
with objectives, standards, and reqillrements of these regulations.

Public Works. No work shall begin until plans are
approved by the City Engineer. Plan approval
shall be based on the requirements of the approved
preliminary plat and other applicable city
standards.
1. Every subdivision shall make adequate plans
and provisions to accommodate, control, and
dispose of storm water by means of drains,
storm sewers, catch basins, culverts,
detention facilities and other facilities as
i:ieemed necessary t>y the ~i ty -Engineer.
2. Facilities for storm drainage and detention
-38-
of storm water shall be designed and
constructed so as to control changes in the
rate and character of storm water runoff onto
adjoining property or downstream systems to
that which existed prior to the development.
3. On-site detention facilities or other appropriate
and approved means to trap sediment
during construction and to control the
increased runoff from development shall be
incorporated in the subdivision drainage
plans. Detention facilities shall be
designed to comply with the latest
requirements of the Arkansas Department of
Environmental Quality. A permit must be
obtained from the Arkansas Department of
Environmental Quality prior to submittal of
the subdivision layout to the City Engineer.
Detention facilities are currently required
for any area greater than 10 acres. The rain
fall amount shall be determined from the U.S.
Weather Bureau, Rainfall Frequency Atlas of
the United States; Technical Paper No. 42,

be maintained by the subdivider, owner of
record, or property owners association.
Maintenance shall include removal of sediment
when the basin's function is impaired, mowing,
removal of debris, reseeding or
resodding.
In instances where on-site detention is
deemed unnecessary by the Arkansas Department
of Environmental Quality based upon
submission of proper proof by the engineer of
record, on-site detention requirements may be
waived by the Planning Commission upon
recommendation by the City Engineer. Such
waiver shall be due to local topographical or
other physical conditions, and accessibility
to an existing drainage system which has
adequate capacity without detention to
contain all runoff from the proposed
__ deve-1.opment _ _and _ _existing .developments during
two 25-year one hour rainfall.

shall provide all necessary maintenance and
erosion control measures to keep ditches and
drainage systems free of debris and sediment.
Appropriate erosion control measure shall
include temporary or permanent seeding,
sodding, mulching, staked straw bales, silt
fences, temporary diversion ditches, silt
basins, terracing and ditch checks. Prior to
construction, an Erosion Control Plan
prepared by a registered professional
engineer shall be submitted to the Department
of Public Works for review and approval. The
Erosion Control Plan shall be designed to:
a. Disturb the least amount of vegetated
area practicable to minimize erosion.
b. Entrap all sediment on the property.
c. Prevent tracking of mud and dirt by
construction activity onto adjoining
existing roadway.
d. Establish ground cover at the earliest
possible time.
B. Storm Drainage, Facility Design Specifics -
Facilities for storm drainage should be designed
and constructed so as to minimize increases in the
rate of storm runoff onto adjoining property over
that which existed prior to development.
1. Enclosed facilities for storm drainage
(underground pipes, box culverts, etc) shall
be gf adeguat~ ca,pa,cJt:}', and designed in
accordance with 1 hour rainfall design
frequency. Non-enclosed facilities (open
ditches) shall be designed based upon the 25
year 1-hour rainfall event assuming poor
-40-
maintenance. Developments where the area
contributing runoff is less than 200 acres
may be designed using the rational method for
calculating runoff. "C" values selected shall
be based on future conditions with full
development of the subdivision. An acceptable
alternate method for areas less than 200
acres is Natural Resources Conservation
Services TR-55 Method (CN Procedure) . Areas
above 200 acres shall use HEC-RAS procedures.
Provisions shall be made for storm water
emergency overflow in subdivisions having
enclosed systems. This system is an above
ground system consisting of swales or other
drainage mechanisms with the capacity to
carry excess water not carried by the
underground system. This system combined with
the underground system shall have the
capacity for a 50 year, 1 hour rainfall
design frequency.
2. Storm water from upstream watersheds shall be
transmitted through the proposed development
by-111eans n£ .swales .... and/ or __ st_om .. s_e_wex _ __ctr_ains_,

more shall have a concrete paved bottom and
sides of a height sufficient to carry the
design flow. Major natural streams are
exempted from this requirement. Minimum
bottom width shall be 2 feet with maximum
side slopes of IV:2H. Open drainage ditches
carrying less than 10 CFS may be concrete
lined or grass lined. Grass lined ditches
shall have a minimum bottom width of 2 feet,
shall have side lopes of IV:3H or flatter and
shall be designed to have velocities which do
not erode the channel and which are not so
low as to cause sedimentation. Open drainage
ditches along property side lot lines shall
not be permitted, unless approved by the City
Engineer and only then in extraordinary
circumstances.
-4. --'Ule .minimum allowable pipe siz.e shall be
fifteen (15") inch diameter. Pipes longer
than 30' shall have a minimum pipe size of
eighteen (18") inches diameter.

storm drainage shall be of adequate capacity, and
designed in accordance with not less than a
twenty-five (25) year rainfall. Provision shall be
made for storm water emergency overflow in
subdivisions having enclosed storm systems. This
system is an above ground system consisting of
swales or other drainage mechanisms with the
capacity to carry excess water not carried by the
underground system. This system combined with the
underground system shall have the capacity
carrying runoff from a 50 year, 1-hour rainfall
with water surface a minimum of 12 inches below
finished floors of residences. Drainage openings
J:hrough .arterial . ..s tr.eets or _r_o_asis __g_ut_side 9_f' __ J],0Qq_
plains shall be designed to carry the discharge
from a 100 year frequency rainfall without
overtopping the roadway. Drainage openings in all
streets and roads within the flood plain shall be
designed to carry the discharge from a 100 year
frequency rainfall without raising the water
surface profile above the FEMA floodplain
elevation at the site of the crossing. Drainage
openings in all other streets and roads shall be
resigned to carry the discharge from a 25 year
rainfall.
1. All roadway pavements shall be designed to
eliminate flow of drainage across the
pavement cross-section or crossing the crown
of the street for a _25 year event.
2. All street crowns on standard residential
streets shall be six inches (6"), including a
one inch (1") gutter sloped to the curb.
3. Pipe culverts crossing streets in city rightof-
way shall extend to the right-of-way line.
Box culverts and bridges which cross streets
in city right-of-way need not extend to the
-42-
right-of-way lines on each side but shall be
of sufficient width to accommodate the required
vehicle roadway section, shoulders and
pedestrian sidewalks.
4. Curb inlets shall be designed to adequately
accommodate the design storm volw:ne of flow
in the gutter and shall have a throat inlet
capacity of 1.5 times the design gutter flow.
Curb inlets shall be spaced so that at no
point will the depth of water exceed 3 inches
at the curb. Maximum inlet spacing shall be
500 feet. Curb inlets will be designed to an
H-20 structural roadway capacity.
D. Storm Drainage Easements.
1. Drainage easements shall be provided for all
above ground and underground drainage
facilities. Each easement shall be of
adequate width to allow for future
maintenance.
2. Where a subdivision in a watershed is
traversed by a major watercourse, channel or
stream, a storm drainage easement right-ofway
shall conform substantially to the lines
of the watercourse as it enters and leaves
the property and shall be of sufficient width
and construction to provide design storm
water capacity plus a minimw:n of 15 feet on
each side for access and maintenance,
provided the City Engineer may waive access
easement requirement for one side only. Open
drainage ditches shall have a drainage
easement width equal to the channel. top width
plus 10' (15' minimum width). Underground
storm drains shall have a drainage easement
equal to the top width of the pipe, box
culvert, etc plus 10' (15'mm).
3. There shall be no encroachments into open
drainage channels.
4. No utilities, except for utility crossings,
shall be allowed to encroach in defined
drainage easements.
-43-
5. Wherever possible, sµbdivisions shall be
designed with utility easements on one side
of lot lines and drainage easements on the
other, to minimize fence and physical
obstructions.
E. Construction in Floodplain.
The boundaries of the 100 year floodway and flood
plain shall be shown and clearly labeled on all
areas or lots in the subdivision. No structures
or filling of any kind will be allowed within the
floodway. Construction within the flood plain
will be allowed provided the finished floor
elevation is a minimum of 1 foot above the flood
plain elevation. The volume of fill placed below
the flood plain elevation must be offset by
removal of an equal volUille of material from the
area so there is no net loss of storage capacity.
Any area or lot which is in the flood plain shall
have the lowest allowable finished floor elevation
_indic£t~.d _ _on the finaJplat . __ 'I'.b..i§. f'leyatio)l_Jl111?t..._
be approved by the City Engineer.
F. Diversion of Storm Water to other Water Sheds
Storm water may not be diverted from one watershed
to another within the plat boundaries. A major
watershed is construed to be one that accumulates
drainage on an area greater than one square mile.
