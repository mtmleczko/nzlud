PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of The Municipal Code of the City of South Bend, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance Number 9577-05, enacted March 14, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance (Commencing with Supplement No. 1-76) included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

HISTORY 
City of South Bend 
    The first European to explore what is now Indiana was Rene Robert Cavalier Sieur de la Salle. On December 3, 1679 with a party of thirty men in eight canoes he passed up the St. Joseph River from Lake Michigan and crossed the Portage to the Kankakee. That Portage began where present day Riverview Cemetery is located. 
    Until they were moved west in the 1830's the two major Indiana tribes in Indiana were the Miami and Potawatomi. Until their removal there was no permanent settler or settlement in this area. The first known permanent European to settle was Pierre Navarre who came to Northern Indiana in 1820 in behalf of the American Fur Company. To the north of South Bend, French, English, Spanish and Americans briefly held Fort St. Joseph between LaSalle's time and Navarre's arrival in the area. 
    Three years after Navarre's establishment of a trading post, Alexis Coquillard, another Frenchman, and American Fur Company agent, moved from Detroit. He established a trading post on the St. Joseph. After the Indians, be became the largest land owner of what is now South Bend. 
    Coquillard was followed by Lathrop M. Taylor, another fur trader. Both men were active in manufacturing and milling. Together they platted the town of South Bend in 1831. Taylor became our first postmaster. In that same year, Horatio Chapin settled here, the first merchant not associated with the Indian fur trade. 
    South Bend's industrial growth was slow. Coquillard's Flour Mill was the primary attempt to use water power. But water power did not come into its own until a dam and races were built along the river. 
    During the 1840's and 1850's four major manufacturing firms began business. Almond Bugbee and Alexis Roote formed a firm to manufacture boots and shoes. Eliakim Briggs invented a traveling threshing machine. It was not until the 1850's when the Studebaker brothers (1852) and the Olivers (1855) ushered in the area's industrial era. At the same time the Birdsell Manufacturing Company was producing the Birdsell Clover Huller. This firm operated until 1932. 
    On the national scene, the country was pre-occupied with the Sectional-Slavery question. In South Bend, an active "under ground railway" was maintained by local abolitionists, Thomas Bulla and Solomon Palmer. Two black barbers, James Washington and Matt Sawyer furnished hiding places, solicited funds and generally aided the runaways. Between 1849-1851, local people became engrossed in the famed fugitive slave case fought in the courts of South Bend. The court sustained several local men who prevented a Kentucky slave owner from repossessing his runaways. The owner later sued the men involved and recovered thousands of dollars. The community answered the call to war in 1861. John Auten, from South Bend, was the first Indiana soldier killed in the war. Before the end, South Bend had provided several companies to the cause. Schuler Colfax served in Congress during the period and later became Vice-President under President Grant. 
    After the war and into the 1920's South Bend grew with an influx of immigrants from middle Europe. Poles, Hungarians, Belgians, Irish and Germans brought their colorful cultures into the area. They formed a "melting pot," rivaled only by the larger cities of Chicago and New York. Most found employment with the Studebaker and Oliver Corporations. 
    The area has been strong in the education field since Notre Dame was founded in 1842 by Father Edward Sorin. St. Mary's was chartered in 1855 and the South Bend Commercial College in 1882. Bethel, Holy Cross Junior College, Ivy Tech. and Indiana University of South Bend are products of the 20th Century. 
    Today South Bend is a diversified city; politically, industrially, socially, and culturally, with a population of 107,789. 
Incorporation of South Bend 
    The original plat of the town was recorded March 28, 1831, and it was made the permanent county seat of the St. Joseph County on May 12, 1831. Not until four years later, however, were proceedings commenced to incorporate. On September 8, 1835, the County Commissioners ordered that an election be held on October 3, 1835, for the purpose of electing trustees for the incorporation of the Town of South Bend. This order was granted on petition of two-thirds of the citizens of the proposed town. 
    The town government functioned for about two years but the money panic of 1837 hit the community so hard that the town languished and the town government ceased to function. 
    A few years later after the growth of the community had resumed, it was felt desirable to revive the government, but there was considerable doubt as to whether the original corporation still existed. To cure this problem the state legislature was petitioned for a special charter and on January 15, 1844, the town was re-incorporated by special act of the state legislature. This town government continued to function until the town became a city in 1865. 
    The successive presidents of the town board of trustees were the following: Horatio Chapin (1835-1836); Edmund Pitts Taylor (1837); John Brownfield (1845-1847); John A. Hendricks (1848); Solomon W. Palmer (1850); Matthias Stover (1851); Henry Carleton (1858); Benjamin F. Price (1859); Edmund Pitts Taylor (1861); John A. Hendricks (1863); Henry Carleton (1865). 
    On May 8, 1865, a petition signed by John H. Keedy and 285 others was filed with the town trustees seeking an election on the question of incorporation as a city. Such an election was held on May 22, 1865, and those favoring the change of the form of government from town to city prevailed. The first election of city officers took place on June 5, 1865. 
    Following incorporation in 1865 the city was first laid out in three wards, but in 1867 the Town of Lowell on the east side of the St. Joseph River opposite South Bend was annexed to the city and became the fourth ward. 
    An ordinance authorizing the establishment of a municipal waterworks was adopted on July 7, 1873. Following these two bond issues totaling $165,000.00 were sold, and the system went into operation late in that year. 
    In 1901 the Indiana General Assembly passed an act dealing with the incorporation of cities which applied to a population bracket which apparently included only South Bend. This, then, in effect became a special charter for the City of South Bend and caused the structure of the city government to be set up, for the first time, in the basic form it has held ever since. This "South Bend Charter" (Chapter 108 of the Acts of 1901, approved March 8, 1901 and containing an emergency clause) contained most of the provisions later incorporated in the Cities and Towns Code of 1905 (Chapter 129 of the Acts of 1905) which supplanted it. 
    The following have held the office of mayor since the incorporation of the City of South Bend: William G. George (Rep.) 1865-68; Louis Humphries (Rep.) 1869-72; William Miller (Rep.) 1873-76; Alexander N. Thomas (Rep.) 1877-78; Lucius G. Tong (Rep.) 1879-80; Levi G. Ham (Dem.) 1881-84; George W.

Sec. 2-84.13. - Annual Review of Petitions by Council. 
(a)  All property owners who receive approval of their real and/or personal property tax abatement requests as a result of the Council's action under this article, shall be required to appear before the Council's Community and Economic Development Committee. Such appearances shall take place at a committee meeting following the petitioner's filing of the first Certified declaration application with the County Auditor, required by the State Board of Tax Commissioners pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-5. 
(b)  Additionally, the petitioner shall file with the Committee its annual report on forms previously sent to it by the Community Investment Department. Such notice by the Community Investment Department shall be done annually to each such petitioner on or before, April 15, by mail or email and shall provide notice that if the property owner fails to comply, that it may be subject to fines as set forth in this article. Petitioners must return their completed annual report within thirty (30) days from the date the Community Investment Department sends email notice. 
(c)  The annual report shall include, but not be limited to the following information: 
(1)  The name and address of the person(s) filing the report. 
(2)  The amount of real and/or personal property taxes paid for the property during the year before the property was declared as an Economic Revitalization Area and during the most recent tax year. 
(3)  The current number of part-time and full-time jobs, specifying whether permanent or temporary, and the number of such jobs as of the end of the year immediately prior to receiving tax abatement.

(5)  The number of minority persons hired for full-time and part-time jobs, specifying whether such jobs are permanent or temporary, since the completion of the project for which tax abatement was given. 
(d)  In addition to the Council's Community and Economic Development Committee being present at said committee meeting to review the petitioner's progress, Workforce Development Services, and members of the Community Investment Department shall be in attendance to question the petitioner. 
(e)  The Council's Community and Economic Development Committee shall review the material presented by the petitioner in comparison to the information published by the County Auditor as required by IC 6-1.1-12.1-8. 
(f)  The Council's Community and Economic Development Committee shall specifically advise each property owner in writing as to whether subsequent appearances before the Committee shall be necessary. If such additional appearances are not required, the property owner shall be duly advised that its future annual reports may be mailed. Failure to mail such completed reports shall result in a fine of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each such failure to comply. 
(Ord. No. 9394-03, § I; Ord. No. 9720-06, § VII, 11-27-06; Ord. No. 10155-12, § I, 3-26-12; Ord. No. 10195-12, § III, 10-22-12) 
Sec. 2-84.14. - Failure of petitioner to comply may result in fines being imposed or termination of economic revitalization designation and repayment of taxes previously abated.[20] 
(a)  The Council believes that the granting of a request for real and/or personal property tax abatement under the terms and conditions of this article and the memorandum of agreement constitutes a contractual arrangement between the Council and the property owner granted abatement. 
(b)  Accordingly, if the petitioner fails to achieve the estimates set forth in its original petition for tax abatement consideration and its statement of benefits, fines may be imposed by the Council relative to the severity of the failure to achieve. 
(c)  Therefore, a petitioner who fails to file its annual report and meet with the Council's Community and Economic Development Committee as required by section 2-84.13 shall be fined two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). 
(d)  A petitioner who complies with section 2-84.13, but fails to provide evidence as to why it has not fulfilled the obligations set forth in the memorandum of agreement and the petitioner's related documents used by the Council when granting the abatement, may be required to pay part or all of the tax abated to-date and may be fined in the minimum amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to a maximum amount of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each such failure to perform. 
(e)  During the term of the abatement, the Community Investment Department may annually request information from the applicant concerning the nature of the project, the approved capital expenditures for the project, the number of full-time permanent positions newly created by the project, and the average wage rates and salaries (excluding benefits and overtime) associated with the positions, and the applicant shall provide adequate written evidence thereof within fifteen (15) days of such request (the "annual survey"). The Community Investment Department shall utilize this information and the information required to be filed by the applicant in the CF-1 compliance with statement of benefits form to verify that the applicant has complied with the commitments contained in the memorandum of agreement at all times after the memorandum of agreement date and during the duration of the abatement. The applicant further agrees to provide any additional information requested by the Community Investment Department related to the information provided in the annual survey and the CF-1 form within a reasonable time following any such additional request. 
(f)  The City, by and through the Council, reserves the right to terminate the Economic Revitalization Area designation and associated property tax abatement deductions if it determines that the applicant has not made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with all of the commitments, and the applicant's failure to substantially comply with the commitments was not due to factors beyond its control. 
(g)  As used in this section, factors beyond the control of the applicant shall only include factors not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the designation, application and submission of statement of benefits which are not caused by any act or omission of the applicant and which materially and adversely affect the ability of the applicant to substantially comply with this section. 
(h)  If the Council terminates the Economic Revitalization Area designation and associated tax abatement deductions, it may require the applicant to repay all or a portion of the tax abatement savings received through the date of such termination. The amount of tax abatement required to be repaid for each year of noncompliance shall not exceed an amount equal to the percentage by which the applicant has failed to attain substantial compliance in any of the aforementioned investment, position retention and/or creation and average hourly wage rate and salary categories multiplied by the dollar amount of taxes actually abated. If the applicant fails to comply with more than one of the aforementioned categories, repayment shall be based on the highest level of non-compliance. The City's Legal Department is hereby authorized to pursue all legal actions necessary in the event of such non-compliance or failure by the applicant to perform other duties and responsibilities arising when it agreed to certain contractual obligations by signing the memorandum of agreement. 
(i)  If at any time during the term of the agreement, whether before or after the commitment date, the applicant shall: (i) cease operations at the facility for which the tax abatement was granted; or (ii) announce the cessation of operations at such facility, then the Council may immediately terminate the Economic Revitalization Area designation and associated tax abatement deductions, and upon such termination, require applicant to repay all of the tax abatement savings received through the date of such termination.

Note- IC 6-101-12.1-5-9, Version b provides in part that if the Common Council "determines that the property owner has not substantially complied with the statement of benefits and that the failure to substantially comply was not caused by factors beyond the control of the property owner" (such as declines in demand for the property owner's products or services) the Council shall hold a hearing after proper notice has been given, with the Council determining whether the property owner has "made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with the statement of benefits and whether any failure to substantially comply was caused by factors beyond the control of the property owner."

The Commission shall have the exclusive power to subpoena, but it shall consult with the Department of Law concerning the issuance of a subpoena.

Such election must be made not later than twenty (20) days after the date of receipt by the electing person of service under this chapter, and such person shall give written notice to the Commission and all other complainants and respondents to whom the finding of probable cause relates. Such civil action shall be filed in the circuit or superior court of St. Joseph County or any other court of proper jurisdiction, and if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant any relief appropriate in a civil action under this Article or IC 22-9.5-8.1-2 or as authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, or the federal Fair Housing Act. 
(3)  In those cases involving discriminatory housing practices as prohibited by this Act where final adjudicative Commission action is in favor of the charging party, the charging party shall be permitted to have damages determined in the circuit of superior court of St. Joseph County or any other court of proper jurisdiction having the power to award punitive damages as allowed by the Fair Housing Act. Charging parties shall make such a request to the Commission in writing within five (5) days from the notice of final Commission action, which notice shall advise charging party of this right to damage determination, and the Commission shall represent charging party at the Commission's expense in such court action for damages. The Commission shall seek such a judicial determination of damages within one (1) year of the alleged discriminatory housing practice. If it is impracticable for the Commission to seek such a determination within one (1) year of the alleged discriminatory act, it shall notify charging party and respondent in writing of its reasons for not doing so, and shall undertake such judicial determination as soon as practicable. 
(j)  Reduce the terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties to a writing to be called a "consent agreement" which the parties and a majority of the Commissioners shall sign and when so signed the consent agreement shall have the same effect as a final decision of the Commission. If the Commission determines that a party to a consent agreement is not complying with the agreement, the Commission may obtain enforcement of the consent agreement in a circuit or superior court upon showing that the party is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. 
(k)  Institute actions in the St. Joseph Superior or Circuit Court for appropriate or equitable relief. 
(l)  Transfer cases to the Indiana Civil Rights Commission or to an appropriate federal agency and to receive cases transferred from the Indiana Civil Rights Commission or from an appropriate federal agency.

(Ord. No. 8243-92, § 1; Ord. No. 8474-94, § 1; Ord. No. 8777-97, § I; Ord. No. 9195-01, § I; Ord. No. 9275-01, § I) 
Sec. 6-37.1. - Vacant building maintenance and registration. 
(a)  The Common Council makes the following legislative findings: 
(1)  In South Bend, Indiana, a significant number of unoccupied buildings are not maintained and constitute a hazard to public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Vacant buildings often become dilapidated because they are not maintained and repaired by their owners. 
(3)  Vacant buildings attract children, harbor vermin, shelter vagrants and criminals, and are likely to be damaged by vandals or arsonists. 
(4)  Unkempt grounds surrounding vacant and abandoned buildings invite dumping of garbage, trash and other debris. 
(5)  Many vacant and abandoned buildings are on narrow lots and close to neighboring buildings, increasing the risk of fire and spread of insect and rodent infestation. 
(6)  Vacant and abandoned buildings contribute to blight, cause a decrease in property values, and discourage neighbors from making improvements to buildings. 
(7)  Buildings that remain boarded up for an extended period of time also exert a blighting influence and contribute to the decline of the neighborhood by decreasing property values, discouraging persons from moving into the neighborhood, and encouraging persons to move out of the neighborhood. 
(8)  Vacant and abandoned buildings often continue to deteriorate to the point that demolition of the structure is required, decreasing available housing in the community and contributing to the neighborhood decline. 
(9)  The blighting influence of vacant and abandoned buildings adversely affects the tax revenues of local government. 
(10)  Vacant and abandoned buildings create a serious and substantial problem and are public nuisances. 
(11)  The City of South Bend spends extraordinary resources and staff time to secure, demolish or otherwise respond to problems associated with vacant and abandoned buildings. 
(12)  Owners of vacant and abandoned buildings should be held accountable for the physical condition of their buildings. At a minimum they should prevent such buildings from exerting a negative influence on the well-being of the neighborhoods where they are located. 
Accordingly, in addition to the property maintenance requirements set forth in this Code, the Common Council establishes the following standards for maintenance of any real property within the City of South Bend which is vacant and abandoned as defined by this section. 
(b)  This article: 
(1)  Establishes a program for ongoing identification and registration of buildings which have been vacant for a certain length of time. 
(2)  Establishes responsibilities of owners of these vacant buildings; and 
(3)  Provides for administration and enforcement of standards related to vacant buildings. 
This section should be construed liberally to effect its purposes and intent. 
(c)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words and phrases have the meanings set forth below: 
(1)  For purposes of this section, vacant building means a structure on a parcel of real property which lacks the habitual presence of human beings who have a legal right to be on the premises, or at which substantially all lawful business operations or residential occupancy has ceased. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, abandoned building means a structure on a parcel of real property which is: vacant for more than ninety (90) days; the subject of an order issued pursuant to the Indiana Unsafe Building Law; and at which the condition which generated the order has existed for at least thirty (30) days and has not been remedied. 
(3)  For purposes of this section an owner is a person or entity with a fee interest in a parcel of real property on which a vacant and abandoned building is located, and whose identity and address may be determined from an instrument recorded in the St. Joseph County Recorder's Office. 
(d)  Continuing maintenance; mandatory and voluntary registration. 
(1)  Upon finding a building vacant and abandoned, the Director of the Department of Code Enforcement may issue to the building owner an order for continuing maintenance pursuant to the Unsafe Building Act, IC 36-7-9, as it may be amended from time to time, or pursuant to similar authority granted by State statute, this Code or other statutes, ordinances and regulations. 
(2)  The owner of a building that is abandoned as defined by this section shall register with the Department of Code Enforcement pursuant to Subsection (f) of this section. 
(3)  The owner of a building that is vacant but not abandoned, within the meaning of this section may opt to register the building with the Department of Code Enforcement, so as to notify City officials of the Property Manager and exchange other information pertinent to the condition of the building. 
(e)  Property Manager. 
(1)  The owner of a building required to be registered pursuant to this section must appoint a Property Manager residing within fifty (50) miles of the property. The failure to appoint a Property Manager is a separate violation of this section. The Property Manager may be the owner or an agent of the owner. 
(2)  An agent acting as the Property Manager must be at least eighteen (18) years of age. 
(3)  The Property Manager must be available to government officials by telephone twenty-four (24) hours a day. The owner's failure to make certain that such a Property Manager is available and maintains the property is a separate violation of this section. 
(f)  Information required with registration. The owner of a building that is vacant and abandoned shall register the property with the Department of Code Enforcement upon receipt of an order for registration. Registration shall be on a form provided by the Department of Code Enforcement, shall be verified under the penalties for perjury, and shall include the following information: 
(1)  The street address of the property; 
(2)  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of all persons or entities which hold an ownership, land contract, mortgage or other lien interest in the property, and all beneficiaries of any land trust which owns the property; 
(3)  A copy of the most recently executed deed used to transfer title to the property and the most recently prepared sales disclosure form, if available to the owner; 
(4)  The names and residential and business addresses and telephone numbers of the Property Manager; 
(5)  The names and addresses of all persons or entities which hold a lien interest or a substantial property interest in the property; 
(6)  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the insurance agent and the carrier providing insurance coverage for the property as required by this section; and 
(7)  The owner's plan for maintenance and repair of the property, including the time within which the owner anticipates completion of all repairs necessary to bring the property into compliance with all Property Maintenance Codes. However, the owner's statement of a plan does not relieve the owner of any orders issued pursuant to the Unsafe Building Law or of any obligations imposed by statute, ordinance or regulation governing the maintenance of property. The Department's receipt of a plan does not constitute approval of the owner's plan or of any violation of property maintenance standards. 
(8)  The owner is responsible for providing an updated registration form to the Department of Code Enforcement within five (5) business days of any change of ownership or any information provided by the registration. The failure of the owner to provide such updated information within five (5) business days of any change is a violation of this section. 
(g)  Standards for maintenance. 
(1)  At least once each week, the owner of a property required to be registered under this section must ensure that the property is inspected and secured against unlawful entry, and that it is cleaned, vegetation is mowed, and cleared of snow and ice in the walkways. Records of such inspections shall be provided to the Department of Code Enforcement upon request. 
(2)  The window and door openings of all buildings on the property shall be secured against unlawful entry by the use of locks designed for such use. 
(3)  In order to protect a building against unlawful entry or vandalism while it is vacant, an owner may secure the windows and doors of the building by the use of boarding. If boarding is used to secure the building, the following standards must be met: Windows shall be framed by two-inch by four-inch (2"×4") boards secured with plywood to the frame by using six (6) seven-inch lag bolts into King studs in all corners and in the center of the vertical boards. The plywood must be 4-ply CDX sheeting or approved equivalent material, no less than one-half (1/2) inch in thickness and attached by tamper proof screws no less than three (3) inches in length. The screws must be type W for wood and type S for steel, and must be applied to a maximum of eight (8) inches on center. 
(4)  Boarding of a vacant structure is to be considered a temporary and not a long-term method of securing the building. Any boards applied to secure doors and windows for more than thirty (30) days must be surface coated with exterior grade paint so as to reduce the blighting effect on the immediate neighborhood. 
(h)  Registration Fees . 
(1)  The owner of any building required to be register under this section shall pay an annual registration fee to the Department of Code Enforcement upon registration. However, the owner of a building that is vacant but not abandoned within the meaning of this section, who voluntarily registers the building pursuant to subsection (d)(3), is not required to pay a registration fee. 
(2)  If the building is used for or zoned for residential purposes and contains not more than three (3) residential units the registration fee shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00) per year. 
(3)  If the building is used or zoned for residential purposes and contains more than three (3) residential units, or if it is used or zoned for any non-residential purposes, the fee shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first year or any part thereof, seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for the second year or any part thereof, and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for the third year and each subsequent year or any part thereof that the property is required to be registered pursuant to this section. 
(4)  The purpose of the registration fee is to reimburse the Department of Code Enforcement for the costs of continual monitoring the property by trained staff, and the additional costs of responding to emergencies and property maintenance requirements for a vacant and abandoned building, which includes but is not limited to personnel costs associated therewith to see that there is compliance with regard to repairs, demolition, blight elimination, deconstruction, and legal expenses incurred by the City. 
(5)  The Director of the Department of Code Enforcement shall have the limited authority to waive accrued fees and/or fines on a case by case basis when those costs are determined to impede positive action on an individual property to rehabilitate it for public benefit. 
(6)  The Department of Code Enforcement shall produce and maintain records showing when a property has been repaired; when a property has become occupied, secured and has its utilities turned on; when a property has been demolished, and when a property has been placed under contract for demolition prior to December 31 st of each calendar year; and each of those properties which can be verified as meeting one of these criteria shall not be required to register and pay the applicable fee. 
(7)  The Department of Code Enforcement shall file with the Office of the City Clerk an Annual Report by the first Monday of May which details the number of buildings which paid a registration fee for each category addressed in subsection (3) herein; the number of cases where the accrued fees and/or fines were waived; and other pertinent data related to the collection of fees. 
(i)  Liability insurance. 
(1)  The owner of any property required to be registered by this section must maintain a policy of liability insurance for the building, and must provide to the Department of Code Enforcement the name, address and telephone number of the insurance agent and carrier, along with a copy of the certificate or other proof of insurance coverage. The coverage required shall be not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per occurrence and one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) in the aggregate. 
(2)  The policy of insurance must require the agent or carrier to provide fifteen (15) days' advance notice of cancellation to the Department of Code Enforcement. 
(j)  Exemptions. The Director of the Department of Code Enforcement may exempt a property from the registration requirements of this section if the property is the subject of an open probate estate or has suffered extensive fire or catastrophic damage within the past ninety (90) days. Any exemption granted shall be for a specific period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days. However, exemption from the registration requirements shall not constitute approval of any violation of property maintenance standards established by statute or this Code. 
(k)  Penalties. An ordinance violation citation shall be issued for violating any provision of the requirements of this section, or for knowingly providing false information or withholding information required to be provided by the registration requirements of this section. Such a citation shall be issued to the owner and shall impose a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for the first day of violation, and not less than six hundred ($600.00) for all subsequent violations. No fine, however, shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). The citations and fines imposed by this section are in addition to other legal and equitable remedies and enforcement action available to the City. 
(l)  Quarterly administrative reports to the Office of the City Clerk addressing implementation and enforcement. All City offices charged with implementing and enforcing the regulations set forth in the section shall report on a quarterly basis a written summary of their actions to the Office of the City Clerk. 
(Ord. No. 9810-07, § 1; Ord. No. 10347-15, § I, 2-9-15)

(b)  Only demolitions which are a declared imminent public safety hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the City may be demolished during any quarter where the Quarterly Administrative Report is not current and properly filed with the Office of the City Clerk. 
(c)  For each proposed demolition a "Fiscal Impact/Future Use Summary Statement" shall be required to be filed by the City Administration with the Office of the City Clerk, with such filing being made not less than seventy-two (72) hours before the proposed demolition. Said form shall be filed along with a completed City "Demolition Prioritization Form" set forth as Figure 82 in the Appendix of the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Task Report, page 67.

(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the Board of Public Works is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the Board of Public Works shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and

(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the Board of Public Works is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Board of Public Works shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:

The Board of Public Works shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the initial basic rates and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the initial basic rates, the Board of Public Works shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections.

In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the Clerk of the Board of Public Works with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its initial basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the Board of Public Works shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Board of Public Works' findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the initial basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the initial basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10) percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the initial basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The Board of Public Works will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review and rules and regulations promulgated by the Board of Public Works. The Board of Public Works may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten (10) percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's initial basic rates, the Board of Public Works shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include on of the following: 
a.  If the initial basic rates are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or are justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Board of Public Works shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the initial basic rates are not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the initial basic rates, the Board of Public Works shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the Board of Public Works determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the Board of Public Works may order the rates reduced in accordance with Paragraph (g) or (h) above, as applicable. In addition, the Board of Public Works may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Board of Public Works' decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If the initial basic rates are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the initial basic rates, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the Board of Public Works must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the City.

(1)  If the Board of Public Works is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Board of Public Works shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety (90) days if the Board of Public Works needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the Board of Public Works has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the Board of Public Works shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the Board of Public Works shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested person may express their views and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may request the Clerk of the Board of Public Works to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made a part of the record, the objector must provide the Clerk of the Board of Public Works with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the Board of Public Works is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the Board of Public Works later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the Board of Public Works shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Board of Public Works' findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the Board of Public Works shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showing. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the Board of Public Works will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The Board of Public Works may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The Board of Public Works' decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reason for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the Clerk of the Board of Public Works to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds.

a.  The Board of Public Works was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in paragraph (c) above; and 
b.  The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The board of Public Works determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the Board of Public Works disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Board of City Works' decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The Board of Public Works' decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 8464-94, § 1, 2-14-94) 
Sec. 7-17. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the Board of Public Works may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the Board of Public Works may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the Board of Public Works may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which its applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, shall not be considered. 
(c)  Board of public works action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b), will be acted upon by the Board of Public Works. The Board of Public Works will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the Board of Public Works denies the request, the Board of Public Works shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the City, the cable operator may request that the City return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the City will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the Board of Public Works, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the Board of Public Works denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five (5) working days of the Board of Public Works' decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. No. 8464-94, § 1, 2-14-94) 
Sec. 7-18. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external cost for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the Clerk of the Board of Public Works at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The City will review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the City makes no objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 8464-94, § 1, 2-14-94) 
Sec. 7-19. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Refunds. The City may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances:

It shall constitute a false alarm if the officer cannot inspect the area protected by the alarm system because of a fence or other obstruction, and the keyholder fails to arrive at the premises within fifteen (15) minutes of the officer's arrival. 
(b)  If the officer at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the officer shall make a report of the false alarm, notice of which shall be sent to the alarm user at the address of the premises, or at the known address of the alarm user, if different from the premises address.

CHAPTER 13 - OFFENSES AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
ARTICLE 1. - GANG LOITERING REGULATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Prior to the enactment of Art. 1 by Section I of Ord. No. 9347-02, Section 2 of Ord. No. 7843-87, adopted Dec. 21, 1987, repealed former Ch. 13, Art. 1 in its entirety. Such article contained §§ 13-1-13-23, which pertained to charitable solicitations and derived from Ord. No. 4927-67, §§ 1-19; Ord. No. 6236-77, § 6; and Ord. No. 6722-79, § 12. Provisions relative to charitable solicitations may be found in § 4-55 of this Code. 

Sec. 13-1. - Legislative findings and intent. 
    The Common Council of the City of South Bend, Indiana, makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Quality of life issues are of paramount importance, affecting not only the physical well-being and safety of the City's residents, but are vital to revitalizing the central business district, the older commercial strips, and our residential neighborhoods which must be recognized as being safe, secure and civil public spaces. 
(2)  Persons who engage in unlawful conduct in public places harass and unduly interfere with the lawful use and enjoyment of such public places thereby constituting a danger to the public health and safety. 
(3)  It is appropriate for the protection of the public safety and welfare to enact reasonable regulations to ensure that public safety is not jeopardized by acts of loitering when they are committed for the purpose of intimidation, coercion, harassment, menacing or assaultive conduct in violation of applicable law. 
(4)  Loitering in public places by criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area resulting from the high rates of drug-dealing, shootings and vandalism often associated with such activities which intimidate law-abiding citizens, diminishes the value of nearby property, and has the potential to destabilize communities and attract further violence. 
(5)  The existence of such gang loitering is often accompanied by secondary effects that are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of South Bend, Indiana. Such secondary effects include significant criminal activity and activities injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community, detrimental effects on nearby businesses and residential areas and a decline in property values. 
(6)  Current ordinances are inadequate to deal with the problems posed by gang loitering and loitering as a means to facilitate trafficking in narcotics and controlled substances since many depend upon the willingness of civilians to testify against gang members and drug dealers with civilians being reluctant to put themselves in harms way by providing such testimony. 
(7)  This article is further intended to detect and discourage the involvement of gang activities, to prevent the exploitation of minors, to effectively deploy the City's limited law enforcement resources, to protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and to assist law enforcement in the enforcement of loitering regulations when associated with the violation of controlled substance and alcoholic beverage laws, assaults, and breaches of the peace which negatively impact the quality of life in the neighborhoods where it is allowed to persist. It is not the intent of the City that this article have either the purpose or effect of suppressing lawful assembly or speech activities protected by the federal or state constitutions. 
(Ord. No. 9347-02, § I)

(a)  The Chief of Police of the South Bend Police Department shall by written directive designate areas of the City in which the Chief of Police has determined that enforcement of Section 13-3 is necessary because gang loitering has enabled criminal street gangs to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.

ARTICLE 2. - PANHANDLING AND SOLICITATION REGULATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Prior to the enactment of Art. 2 by Ordinance No. 9289-01, Ordinance No. 5594-73, § 1, enacted Oct. 22, 1973, repealed former Art. 2, §§ 13-24-13-27, pertaining to curfew for minors and derived from Ord. No. 5053-69, §§ 1-3. 

Sec. 13-24. - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The South Bend Common Council finds that there is a need to impose reasonable panhandling and solicitation regulations. Such regulations will improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city, protect the safety of the general public against certain intimidating and abusive conduct of panhandlers, while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens. 
(b)  The Council further finds that the City should provide a safe and orderly environment where social, business, recreational and cultural opportunities can be maximized while eliminating the secondary effects of nuisance activities that negatively affect such types of interactions in the Central Business and Entertainment Area of the City. 
(c)  The Common Council finds that an increase in aggressive solicitation has become increasingly disturbing and disruptive to residents and visitors to the City, and has directly contributed to the loss of access to and enjoyment of certain public places and has engendered a sense of fear, intimidation, and disorder. 
(d)  The Common Council therefore declares that the following panhandling and solicitation regulations are promulgated pursuant to the "Home Rule" powers vested in the City pursuant to IC 36-1-3-1 et seq. which grants among other powers, all powers which are needed for the effective operation of government as to local affairs and authorizes the enactment or ordinances which protect the health, safety and welfare of its residents and which would preserve the peace, order and safety of its community; IC 36-1-4-11 and IC 36-4-6-12 et seq. which permit cities to pass and enforce ordinances; and IC 36-1-4-6 which authorizes cities to use, improve and protect its interests in property. 
(e)  The South Bend Common Council finds that the panhandling and solicitation regulations provided in this article are intended to be content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve significant government interests, and would permit ample alternative channels of communication. [3]

The South Bend Common Council believes that all regulations set forth in this article are consistent with the constitutional criteria established by the United States Supreme Court in Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37, 45 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1993).

(a)  Aggressive manner means: 
(1)  Approaching or speaking to a person, or following a person before, during or after soliciting if that conduct is intended or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm to oneself or to another, or damage to or loss of property, or otherwise be intimidated into giving money or other object of value;

(7)  Using profane, offensive or abusive language, or speaking in a volume unreasonably loud which is inherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction, either before, during or after soliciting; or

(e)  Public place means an area to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, including any street, highway, alley, sidewalk, parking lot, plaza, transportation facility, library, school, place of entertainment, park, playground, bridge, and any doorway, entrance, lobby to such buildings enclosing them.

Many of the repealed provisions were adopted with the adoption of this Code; others derived from §§ 26-4 and 26-25 of the 1962 Code; § 7 of Ord. No. 6236-77; and § 13 of Ord. No. 6722-79. 

Sec. 13-35. - Legislative findings.

(b)  The Council further finds that such congestion contributes to increased noise in the adjacent neighborhoods and often damage to private property. 
(c)  The Council further finds that the activity of persons engaged in ticket selling often interferes with the ability of residents of adjacent neighborhoods to quietly enjoy their private property. 
(d)  The Council believes that reasonable regulations of ticket selling in the City of South Bend would serve the community interest by helping to provide a safer environment and enhancing the quality of life where such activity is currently causing detrimental effects on the safety and welfare of the residents of the City.

A motor vehicle that is knowingly used in the commission of prostitution as defined in IC 35-45-4-2, patronizing a prostitute as defined in IC 35-45-4-3, or for promoting prostitution as defined in IC 35-45-4-4 shall be subject to seizure and impoundment under this section. 
(c)  Seizure and impoundment. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the City or its agents. This subsection shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation of subsection (b) was stolen at the time of the alleged violation and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within seventy-two (72) hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered.

(j)  Posting of bond. If a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) is posted with the City Attorney's office, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owners of record. If a five hundred dollar ($500.00) penalty is imposed for a violation of this section, the five hundred dollar ($500.00) bond will be forfeited to the City. However, in the event a violation of this section is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the five hundred dollar ($500.00) bond will be returned to the person or entity posting the bond. 
(k)  Failure to pay penalty. If the penalty and applicable towing and storage fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after a penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles. 
(l)  Judicial review pending. Provided, however, the vehicle shall not be deemed abandoned if a petition for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination pursuant to IC 4-21.5-1 et seq. is pending in a court of proper jurisdiction. Where a petition for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination is sought pursuant to IC 4-21.5-1 et seq. and is subsequently resolved in favor of the City, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles if the penalty and applicable towing and storage fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the resolution of this petition for judicial review.

Noise shall be deemed to be unreasonable when it disturbs, injures, or endangers the peace or quiet safety, or health of reasonable persons of ordinary sensitivity within the city, or if such noise causes unreasonable discomfort to any persons within the neighborhood from which such noise emanates or if it detrimentally or adversely affects operators of businesses, customers of businesses, or neighborhood residents within the area from which such noise emanates. Any such unreasonable noise shall be considered a noise disturbance and a public nuisance.

(4)  The duration of the sound; and 
(5)  Whether the sound is recurrent, intermittent, or constant.

(1)  The sounding of any horn, signaling, or other similar device on any automobile, motorcycle, or other vehicle on any street or public place except as a danger warning; the creation by means of any such signaling device of any unreasonably loud and raucous sound; and the sounding of any such device for an unreasonable period of time. The use of any signaling device except one operated by hand or electricity; the use of any horn, whistle or other devise operated by engine exhaust; and the use of any such signaling device when traffic is for any reason held up. More than five (5) consecutive seconds shall be a prima facie unreasonable period of time. 
(2)  Using, operating, or permitting to be played, used or operated any radio, television, boombox, stereo, radio receiving set, musical instrument, or other machine or device that produces or reproduces sound in a manner as to unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet of the neighboring inhabitants or any person who in the room, vehicle or chamber in which such machine or device is operated and who is not a voluntary listener, or which is plainly audible at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the building, structure or vehicle in which it is located and unreasonably disturbs the peace and quiet of neighbors in residential or noise sensitive areas, including multifamily or single-family dwellings. The operation of such device in a manner prohibited herein between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. 
(3)  Using, operating, or permitting to be played, used or operated, any radio receiving set, musical instrument, phonograph, loudspeaker, sound amplifier, or other machine or device for the producing or reproducing of sound which is cast upon the public street for the purpose of commercial advertising or attracting the attention of the public to any building or structure.

(8)  a.  The use of any automobile, motorcycle or other vehicle so out of repair, so loaded or in such a manner as to create loud and unnecessary engine noise, grating, grinding, rattling or other noise in excess of the noise limit measured in decibels as prescribed by State standards. The noise limit applies to total noise from a motor vehicle or motorcycle including that noise of other vehicles attached thereto. 
b.  The operation of any motor vehicle or motorcycle in such a manner as to create excessive noise such as squealing of tires or other noise unrelated to engine noise and noise caused by unnecessary grinding, rattling or other vehicle disrepair need not be measured in decibels to violate this section. 
(9)  The creation of an unreasonably loud and excessive noise in connection with loading or unloading any vehicle or the opening and destruction of bales, boxes, crates and containers. 
(10)  The erection (including excavating), demolition, alteration or repair of any building, other than between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, except in case of urgent necessity in the interest of public health and safety, and then only with a permit from the Building Commissioner. The permit may be granted for a period not to exceed three (3) days or less while the emergency continues and may be renewed for periods of three (3) days or less while the emergency continues. If the Building Commissioner shall determine that the public health and safety will not be impaired by the erection, demolition, alteration of repair of any building or the excavation of streets and highways within the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., and further determines that loss or inconvenience would result to any party in interest, he or she may grant permission for such work to be done within the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., upon application being made at the time the permit for the work is awarded or during the progress of the work.

(12)  The shouting and crying of peddlers, hawkers and vendors which disturbs the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. 
(13)  The use of any drum or other instrument or device for the purpose of attracting attention by creation of noise to any performance, show or sale.

(15)  The operation between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. of any pile driver, steam shovel, pneumatic hammer, derrick, steam or electric hoist or other appliance, the use of which is attended by unreasonably loud or raucous noise.

(2)  Nature of music to be played; 
(3)  Times and dates when music will be played; 
(4)  A statement verifying that the music will be noncommercial in nature. 
Upon submission of the above information the Board shall review the same, and if it determines that a public nuisance will not be created which would disturb, injure or endanger the peace and safety of others, an annual permit shall be issued. Any permit granted by the Board of Public Works may be revoked upon a determination that the playing of such music creates a loud, raucous, unreasonable or offensive noise in violation of this section. 
(e)  Invalidity. A determination of invalidity or unconstitutionality by a court of competent jurisdiction of any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part, of this section shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this section.

Sec. 13-57.1. - Use of police officers at large parties or gatherings requiring a second response. 
(a)  Complaint and first response. After a complaint is received about a disturbing or disorderly party or gathering, police officers responding to the complaint must determine if there is, in fact, a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare upon arriving at the location. If the party or gathering appears to be a disturbance, the resident or person in charge of the party, or other responsible person shall be informed of the disturbance, the complaint, and the fact that the disturbance must cease. Information shall be further conveyed that the party or gathering shall be allowed to continue so long as the disturbance which generated the complaint ceases. They should further be informed that any continuing disturbance which precipitates another call and a second response by the police will result in a charge to the responsible person for the cost of the police service. A "First Response Notice" should then be handed to the responsible party, preferably after it is signed but the signature is not mandatory. 
(b)  Second response. If the police receive further complaints about the disturbance which requires a second response, the officers responding should again determine if there is a disturbance of the peace resulting from the party or gathering or if the complaint is unfounded. If a disturbance is occurring, the responsible party shall then be given a "Disturbance Violation Fee Notice," indicating that the City will bill the responsible party for the personnel and equipment costs, or other damage and expense, incurred as a result of the disturbance. 
(c)  Responsible party. A responsible party is defined as the person in charge of the premises and the person responsible for the event, or if either of those persons is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor. If no responsible party is located on the premises, the responsible party is deemed to be the property owner(s), as determined by reference to the records of the St. Joseph County Assessor. In such an instance, the responding officer(s) shall leave a copy of the "First Response Notice," as well as a copy of the "Disturbance Violation Fee Notice" if a second response is required, at the premises. Copies of these notice(s) must also be mailed to the property owner as determined from the Assessor's records. 
(d)  Special security assignment. The police personnel utilized during a second response after the first warning, to control the threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, shall be deemed to be on special security assignment over and above the services normally provided. 
(e)  Costs: 
(1)  The costs of such special security assignment may include minor damages to City property and/or injuries to City personnel. A citation for a single incident violation of this section shall be issued to each violator imposing a fifty dollar ($50.00) fine payable through the Ordinance Violation Bureau as addressed in section 2-213 of this Code. The City reserves its legal options to elect any other legal remedies when the costs or damage exceed fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(2)  All costs assessed hereunder shall be payable through the Ordinance Violation Bureau of the City of South Bend, and shall be deposited into the Law Enforcement Continuing Education Fund. 
(f)  Timeliness of notice issuance. A "Disturbance Violation Fee Notice," issued hereunder, may be issued to a responsible party within twelve (12) hours of the issuance hereunder to that party of a "First Response Notice." 
(g)  Enforcement nonexclusive of other remedies. The enforcement of this section shall not abrogate the responding officer's enforcement of any other local ordinances or State laws which may also be violated as a result of a loud party or gathering.

Sec. 13-58. - Discharging firearms prohibited; exception.

ARTICLE 12. - CHRONIC PROBLEM PROPERTY REGULATIONS 

Sec. 13-155. - Findings of the council and purposes of regulations. 
(a)  The Common Council finds that excessive calls for service to problem areas, trouble spots, or high-activity areas, place an undue burden on public safety resources, which may result in decreased public safety services being provided to other geographic areas of the City of South Bend, Indiana. 
(b)  The Council further finds that by utilizing enforcement problem-oriented policing strategies that a corresponding reduction in calls for service and crime prevention should result. 
(c)  The regulations set forth in this Article are designed to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the City. They are further designed to help prevent and assist in abating repeat calls for service to the same property or location, which may result in diminished public safety services being provided to other residents and areas of the City. Repeat nuisance service call fees are authorized to be imposed and collected from the owner of the property designated as a chronic problem property. Such fees are intended to help cover costs incurred by the City which are over and above the cost of providing services to properties not so designated. 
(d)  The regulations set forth in this Article are supplemental to other regulations codified in the South Bend Municipal Code and are designed to address chronic problem properties. 
(Ord. No. 10232-13, § I, 6-10-13)

Sec. 17-4. - Drains and downspouts disconnection requirements; limited exceptions. 
(a)  No newly constructed gutter, downspout, roof drain, foundation drain or off-street parking area drain shall be connected with or permitted to drain into the sanitary or combined sewer system of the City. Whenever it becomes necessary to rebuild, repair or replace any such drain it shall be rebuilt, repaired or replaced in such a manner that it will no longer be connected with or flow into the sanitary or combined sewer system of the City. Alternatively, at the time of renovation the building owner may apply to join the In-lieu of Disconnect Fee Program which is solely available to those property types listed in Section 17-4.1. 
(b)  Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage including cooling water shall be discharged to retention or detention basins, to naturally occurring or constructed wetlands, to rain barrels, cisterns, to a natural outlet, or utilize other best management practices (BMP) methods approved by the Department of Public Works and authorized by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) or in the case of residential properties to "on-lot treatment" practices recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 1 [] 1 The Department of Public Works is authorized to institute additional compliance regulations and standards so long as they are discussed with the Council's Utilities Committee prior to taking effect and conspicuously posted on the City of South Bend's official municipal website. 
(c)  Due to the extraordinary estimated costs to implement the Long Term Control Plan (LTCP) mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), all buildings, residences, sump pumps, and parking lots which currently direct their storm water into the sanitary or combined sewers shall disconnect by the following dates: 
Residential properties: December 31 st , 2020; 
Commercial properties: December 31 st , 2020; 
with the following limited exceptions and requirements: 
(1)  All properties located in Commercial/Mixed Use Districts defined in Section 21-03 of Article 3 of Chapter 21 of the South Bend Municipal Code which include: OB Office Buffer District, MU Mixed Use District, O Office District, LB Local Business District, CB Community Business District, CBD Central Business District, and GB General Business District, as well as all PUD Planned Unit Development Districts and all industrial properties shall disconnect all buildings, sump pumps, and parking lots which currently direct their storm water into the sanitary or combined sewers. If disconnecting is not practical or possible or if the cost incurred would make disconnecting financially impractical or financially impossible the building owner may, at their choosing, enter the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee Program instead of disconnecting. By entering this program the building owner agrees to pay to the City a one-time fee of $0.61 per square foot of connected impervious surface. 
All funds received by the City for the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee Program shall be specifically designated to reduce the financial burden on residents of the combined sewer overflow LTCP. 
By December 31 st 2020 all commercial and industrial buildings shall have either disconnected or shall have entered the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee Program. The Department of Public Works shall, by December 31 st 2017, make available on the City's website a guidance document that will assist commercial building owners in obtaining further information on how to join the Program. The guidance document shall also outline how commercial building owners may pay the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee in installments. 
(2)  An organization established for charitable purposes including but not limited to organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, and governmental organizations over which the City has authority, which cannot disconnect may, depending on number of fulltime equivalent employees, receive the following discounts: 
a.  Such organizations with twenty (20) or fewer fulltime equivalent employees shall not be charged to enter the In-lieu of Disconnect Fee Program. 
b.  Such organizations with more than twenty (20) but fewer than one hundred (100) fulltime equivalent employees shall receive a fifty (50) percent reduction of the fee to enter the In-lieu of Disconnect Fee Program. 
(3)  For-profit businesses with twenty (20) or fewer fulltime equivalent employees which cannot disconnect shall receive a fifty (50) percent reduction of the fee to enter the In-lieu of Disconnect Fee Program. 
(4)  Any commercial building owner that was previously issued a downspout disconnection special exemption by the Board of Public Works shall remain exempt and shall not be subject to the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee. 
(5)  Commercial buildings with sewer discharge meters shall be exempted from the requirement to join the In-Lieu of Disconnect Fee Program. 
(d)  All roofs and sump pumps of all one and two family detached houses, addressed in Chapter 21, Article 2, Section 21-02 of the South Bend Municipal Code as a single family dwelling or a two family dwelling shall be disconnected on or before December 31, 2020. Owners of such single family dwellings or two family dwellings may participate on a one-time basis, at no charge to such owner(s) in calendar years 2017 and 2018, in the City of South Bend's "Downspout Disconnect Program". This program is part of the Neighborhood Improvement program administered by the Division of Engineering in the Department of Public Works. 2 [] Anyone who has not complied with required disconnections by December 31, 2018, may participate in the Downspout Disconnect Program in the 2019 and 2020 calendar years, however he/she shall be charged for such services at the rates established by the Board of Public Works. Any owner of a one or two family detached house addressed in this paragraph who believes that he/she cannot comply with the disconnection requirements must apply to the Downspout Disconnect Program so that an authorized agent of the City may visit his/her property. The City's agent will assess the feasibility of disconnecting. If disconnecting is feasible the City's agent will schedule the disconnection at that time, however if the inspection confirms that disconnecting cannot occur the City's agent will issue an exemption based on his/her on-site investigation.

The Director may develop Best Management Practices (BMP's), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the requirements of this Division. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, State Pretreatment Standards, and Local Limits are subject to the following restrictions and prescriptions: 
(1)  When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users. 
(2)  State and local requirements and limitations on discharges shall be met by all dischargers when such requirements and limitations are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations. 
(3)  When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(4)  Once included in its permit, the Industrial User shall comply with the equivalent limitations developed in lieu of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limits were derived. 
(5)  When a categorical Pretreatment Standard specifies one limit for calculating daily maximum discharge limitations, and a second limit for calculating monthly average discharge limitations, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the daily maximum equivalent limitations. 
(6)  Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify the Director within two (2) business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limit in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(e)  State Standards. Users must comply with the State of Indiana Pretreatment Standards as defined at 327 IAC 5-16 through 327 IAC 5-21. 
(f)  Local standards. 
(1)  The Director is authorized to establish Local Limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c) to protect the objectives specified in Section 17-8(a). 
(2)  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against Pass Through and Interference. No Significant Industrial User shall discharge wastewater in excess of the following daily maximum discharge limitations: [0.00019) mg/L total mercury. 
(3)  The Director may, at the Director's sole discretion, implement local limits through allocation of the Daily Maximum Allowable Industrial Load (MAIL) and the Monthly MAIL to Significant Industrial Users. The Daily MAIL is the total daily loading of a pollutant available to be allocated to all Significant Industrial Users. The Monthly MAIL is the total loading of a pollutant available to be allocated to all Significant Industrial Users as a monthly average. The monthly average is calculated as the sum of the concentrations of all daily discharges measured during a calendar month divided by the number of daily discharges measured that month. Daily MAILs and Monthly MAILs for the following pollutants are hereby incorporated by reference: 
Arsenic 
c Cadmium 
c Chromium 
Copper 
c Cyanide 
l Lead 
n Nickel 
s Silver 
z Zinc 
(4)  Significant Industrial Users (SIU) who have not been given an allocation for one of the pollutants listed above shall notify the City of South Bend at least 90 days in advance of a change in the characteristics of their wastewater that would increase the expected concentration of that pollutant in their wastewater discharge. In addition, the City may determine at any time that an SIU wastewater discharge requires a limitation for a pollutant, regardless of the concentration levels listed below, and may then develop a limit based on the MAIL. In any case, SIU discharge that is found to contain in excess of the following concentrations will be reviewed for the need for a limit. The Director may require more sensitive analysis when results are reported as less than the following concentrations or less than greater concentrations: 
Arsenic-0.2 mg/L 
Cadmium-0.1 mg/L 
Chromium-2.0 mg/L 
Copper-0.3 mg/L 
Lead-0.3 mg/L 
Nickel-0.3 mg/L 
Silver-0.2 mg/L 
Zinc-0.3 mg/L 
Cyanide-0.1 mg/L 
(g)  Dilution Prohibition. No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(h)  Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent Standards or Requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this Division. 
(i)  Equipment Maintenance. When a discharger is required to provide preliminary treatment, including interceptors or flow equalization facilities, such equipment shall be maintained by the discharger in satisfactory operating condition as determined by the Board of Public Works or its designee. 
(j)  Control Manhole. When required by the Director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying non-residential wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Agents of the City, the State Water Pollution Control Agencies and the USEPA shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing.

Approved requests for a sampling waiver for pollutants not present shall result in a modification of the permittee's industrial wastewater discharge permit. 
(5)  Reports of Changed Conditions. Each User must notify the Director of any significant changes to the User's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
a.  The Director may require the User to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Subsection (f) "Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit - Contents" of this Section 17-10. 
b.  The Board of Public Works may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under Subsection (j) of this Section 17-10 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Subsection (l) "Permit Modification" of this Section 17-10, in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(6)  Reports of Spills and Potential Problems. 
a.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or a Slug Load, or any unusual flows or wastes that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the User. 
b.  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Division. 
c.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection (6)a. above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
d.  Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge. 
(7)  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All Users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director as the Director may require. 
(8)  Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(9)  Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. 
a.  Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the User discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the User: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this Subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Subsection (o)(5) "Reports of Changed Conditions" of this Section 17-10. The notification requirement in this Subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Subsection (o)(1) "Baseline Monitoring Report; Subsection (o)(3) Reports on Compliance with Pretreatment Standard Deadlines; and Subsection (o)(4) "Periodic Compliance Reports" of this Section 17-10. 
b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection (9)a. above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
e.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
(10)  Notification of batch or infrequent discharge. The Director may require an industrial user that discharges industrial wastewater on a batch or infrequent basis to submit notification to the Director up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to discharge of such wastewater, in order to allow inspection and sampling. 
(p)  General Standards for Reports: 
(1)  Analytical Requirements . All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties approved by EPA. The Director may require more sensitive analysis if reported pollutant concentrations are not sufficient to determine compliance with Pretreatment Standards or to determine if such Standards are necessary. 
(2)  Sample Collection. 
a.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and be based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
b.  Except as indicated in Sections c and d below, the User must collect samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. 
c.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
d.  For sampling in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which no historical sampling data are available. For Periodic Compliance Reports, required by Subsection 17-10(o)(4), the User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
(3)  Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. If a report is due on a date that does not fall on a normal business day, the report shall be considered timely if it is received on the next normal business day. 
(4)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under Section 17-8. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; any information used to demonstrate that the analysis was performed in accordance with methods approved in 40 CFR Part 136; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. 
(5)  Certification Statements. 
a.  Certification of Permit Applications and User Reports. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in accordance with Subsection (f) of this Section 17-10; Users submitting baseline monitoring reports under Subsection (o)(1) of this Section 17-10; Users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines under Subsection (o)(3) of this Section 17-10; Users submitting periodic compliance reports required by Subsection (o)(4) or other required User reports.

_____
_____ "   
(q)  Confidential Information: Information and data on a User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs, and from the Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act (IC 5-14-3-4(a)(4)). Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(r)  Board of Works powers: If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this Article, and which in the judgment of the Board may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Board may do any of the following: 
(1)  Require new users or users with significant increase in discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior approval for discharges. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, or the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be deemed significant. 
(2)  Reject the wastes in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate by the City. 
(3)  Require pretreatment of such wastes to within the limits of normal domestic sewage as defined. 
(4)  Require control of flow equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug" loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works. 
(5)  Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and treating such wastes. If the Board permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
Board action under Subsections (r)(2), (3), (4) and (5) above, shall be subject to judicial review as per Subsection 17-11(d) of this Division. 
(s)  Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance: The Director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of the Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant Noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. The term Significant Noncompliance shall be applicable to all Significant Industrial Users (or any other Industrial User that violates Subsections (3), (4), or (8) of this Subsection) and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including Instantaneous Limits; 
(2)  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including Instantaneous Limits, as defined in Division 1, Section 17-5.1 of this Article multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as defined in Division 1, Section 17-5.1 of this Article (Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative standard) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director's exercise of his or her emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violations(s), which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the Director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(t)  False information: Any person who makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or who falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Division, may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). 
(u)  Users required to file reports: All Users subject to Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards will be required to file all reports as described in 40 CFR 403, which is incorporated herein by reference, including amendments that may hereafter be made as the same are published in the Code of Federal Regulations. These reports shall include, but not be limited to, baseline monitoring reports, compliance schedule reports, compliance date reports and periodic compliance reports. 
(v)  Compliance Schedule Reports: Compliance schedule reports must be submitted by any nonresidential discharger not subject to categorical standards who is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Division. 
(w)  Bypass: 
(1)  For the purposes of this Section: 
(a)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a User's treatment facility. 
(b)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of Subsections (w)(3) and (4) of this Section. 
(3)  Bypass Notifications. 
(a)  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(b)  A User shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Bypass Prohibition. 
(a)  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and; 
iii.  The User submitted notices as required under foregoing Subsection (w)(3) of this section. 
(b)  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subpart (a)(i) through (iii) above. 
(x)  Upset: 
(1)  For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of Subsection (x)(3)(c), below, are met. 
(3)  A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(a)  An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(b)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(c)  The User has submitted the following information to the Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
(i)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 10095-11, § VI, 6-13-11; Ord. No. 10317-14, § II, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 17-11. - Administrative Enforcement Remedies, Costs, Fees, Director Reconsideration, User Appeals, Judicial Review. 
(a)  Administrative Enforcement Remedies. 
(1)  Letter of Violation. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may serve upon that User a written Letter of Violation. Within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of such letter, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the Director. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Letter of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Letter of Violation. 
(2)  Consent Orders. The Director may enter into consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative compliance orders and cease and desist orders issued pursuant to Subsections (d) and (e) of this Section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(3)  Show Cause Hearing. The Director may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Division 1, Section 17-5.1 of this Article and required by Subsection (p)(5) "Signatories and Certifications" of Section 17-10 of this Division 3. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(4)  Compliance Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(5)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to: 
(i)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(ii)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(6)  Emergency Suspensions. The Director may immediately suspend a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which present, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(i)  Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings of subsequent Subsection (7) of this Section 17-11 are initiated against the User. 
(ii)  A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Subsections (3) or (7) of this Section 17-11. 
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension under this Section. 
(7)  Termination of Discharge . In addition to the provisions in Subsection (n)(4) "Revocation of Permits" of this Section 17-10, any User who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(i)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(ii)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(iii)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(iv)  Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(v)  Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section 17-8 of this Article. 
Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Subsection 17-11 (a)(3) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(b)  Costs. Any User who violates any of the provisions of this Division or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the wastewater treatment and collection system (including all receiving systems) under the jurisdiction of the City shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The Director shall bill the User for the costs incurred for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. 
(c)  Administrative Fines . 
(1)  When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirements, the Director may fine such User in an amount not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the User's appeal is successful, the payment shall be returned to the User. The Director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(d)  Director Reconsideration and User Administrative Appeals. 
(1)  Actions Subject to Director Reconsideration and/or Board of Works Appeal. Any User aggrieved by a final action delegated to the Director under: 
(a)  Subection 17-10(a)(2) requiring a User to restrict the volume or point of discharge; 
(b)  Subsection 17-10(a)(3) requiring a User to install a storage or flow-control facility; 
(c)  Subsection 17-10(a)(2) denying a permit transfer; 
(d)  Subsection 17-10(n)(4) revoking a permit; 
(e)  This Section 17-11, subsection (a), issuing any authorized Administrative Enforcement Remedy; 
(f)  Subsection 17-10(j) Wastewater Discharge Permit Issuance; 
(g)  Section 17-13 Supplemental Enforcement Action; or 
may request reconsideration by the Director within fifteen (15) days of such Director action, and the Director shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of request to make a decision related to reconsideration. If the Director fails to act within thirty (30) days from receipt of the request, or if the Director's reconsideration decision is unsatisfactory to the User requesting reconsideration, the User may appeal such decision to the Board of Public Works upon submission of a written petition for review filed with the Board of Public Works within seven (7) days after notification of the Director's decision, or if the Director fails to act, then the written petition for review shall be filed with the Board of Public Works thirty-five (35) days the date of request for Director reconsideration. 
(2)  Filing Requirements and Procedure. 
(a)  A request for Director reconsideration and a petition for appeal filed under the foregoing provision must identify the specific action or condition to which objection is made, the legal and factual basis for the objection, attaching any documents supporting the objector's position, and the alternative condition or result, if any, that the objector desires. 
(b)  A request for Director reconsideration and a petition for appeal shall be deemed timely filed if delivered in person to the Director's office in the case of a request for reconsideration or the Board's office in the case of petition for appeal, or if sent by mail, it is post-marked on or before the fifteenth (15 th ) day in the case of a request for Director reconsideration, or within seven (7) or thirty-five (35) days in case of a petition to the Board for appeal as described in above Subsection 17-11(d)(1).

(Ord. No. 7942-88, § 1; Ord. No. 9639-05, § I, 11-28-05; Ord. No. 10019-10, § I, 6-28-10; Ord. No. 10290-14, § I, 2-10-14) 
Sec. 17-21. - Sewage rates determination. 
(a)  Generally. For the use of the service rendered by sewage works, rates and charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel or real estate or building that is connected with the City sanitary system or otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of the City of South Bend. Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs, excessive strength surcharges and other service charges, which rates and charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  Schedule of Rates and Charges. 
(1)  The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and charges as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base charge based on the size of water meter installed, except as herein otherwise provided. For the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the water meters shall be read monthly and the users shall be billed each month (or period equaling a month). The water usage schedule on which the amount of said rates and charges shall be determined is as follows: 
Schedule of Rates and Charges 
2014 2015 2016 Metered Rates 
(per 100 cubic feet) $2.55 $2.68 $2.81 Base Monthly Charge 5/8 inch meter $27.11 $28.47 $29.89 3/4 inch meter 36.54 38.37 40.29 1 inch meter 62.46 65.59 68.87 1 1/2 inch meter 140.18 147.18 154.54 2 inch meter 239.05 251.01 263.56 3 inch meter 545.70 572.98 601.63 4 inch meter 969.54 1,018.02 1,068.92 6 inch meter 2,170.72 2,279.25 2,393.22 8 inch meter 3,867.79 4,061.18 4,264.24 10 inch meter 6,033.38 6,335.05 6,651.81 12 inch meter 8,693.13 9,127.78 9,584.17 Unmetered Monthly Rate

(2)  For the service rendered to the City of South Bend said City shall be subject to the same rates and charges established in harmony therewith. 
(3)  In order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes, the City shall charge the user not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per sampling event plus the actual cost for collecting and analyzing the sample(s) as determined by the City or by an independent laboratory. This charge will be reviewed on the same basis as all other rates and charges in this ordinance. 
(c)  Former Wholesale Users. 
(1)  Billing for sewage services to previously designated Class II wholesale users shall be in accordance with the executed intermunicipal contract for wastewater treatment services, but such contracts shall not be extended after their expiration dates due to elimination of the wholesale class of users. This shall not affect authority to enter special rate contracts as provided in Section 17-29 of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 7942-88, § 1; Ord. No. 9387-03, § I; Ord. No. 9442-03, § I; Ord. No. 9639-05, § II, 11-28-05; Ord. No. 10019-10, § II, 6-28-10; Ord. No. 10290-14, § II, 2-10-14) 
Sec. 17-22. - Determination of discharge quantities from outside sources. 
(a)  The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the City shall be determined by the City in such manner as the City shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as hereinafter provided in this section, the City may make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the City that such quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system. 
(b)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building other than a single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the City, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the City, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the City. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this article, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the City for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(c)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the City, and in addition, is a user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the City, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the City. In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the City for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(d)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of four thousand (4,000) cubic feet per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and can not enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the City for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(e)  In order that the domestic and residential users of sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns, the billing for sewage service for residences and/or domestic users shall be based upon the average water usage billed for the previous billed months of November, December, January and February. Averages resulting in fractions of one hundred (100) cubic feet shall be raised to the next whole number of one hundred (100) cubic feet. In the event the average water usage for said previous billed months of November, December, January and February is greater than the actual water usage, then the billing for sewage services shall be computed on the actual water used in the month for which the sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic and/or residential sewage service as applicable to the sprinkling rate shall only apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a residence. Said sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for other than residential purposes (excluding apartment complexes). In the event a portion of said premises shall be used for residential service, the owner may, at his own expense, separate the water service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through a separate meter and in such case the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate. 
(Ord. No. 7942-88, § 1) 
Sec. 17-23. - Heavy demand surcharge. 
(a)  In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to the service rendered to users, the City shall base its charges not only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The City shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner, by such method and at such times as the City may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the City at all times. 
(b)  Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed ammonia-nitrogen in excess of twenty-five (25) milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess of two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid, biochemical oxygen demand in excess of two hundred fifty (250) milligrams per liter of fluid, or phosphorus in excess of ten (10) milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis: 
Excess Strength of Waste
Surcharges 2014 2015 2016 Suspended Solids 
(Per Pound) 
(Concentration Limit 250 mg/l) $0.20 $0.21 $0.22 Biochemical Oxygen Demand

(b)  The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the portion of the total billing charged for operation, maintenance and replacement for that user during the preceding year. 
(c)  The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the City for the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
(d)  As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid within five (5) days of the due date as stated in such bill are hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the rates and charges shall thereupon attach thereto. 
(Ord. No. 7942-88, § 1) 
Sec. 17-25. - Review of rate schedule. 
    The sewage rates and charges set forth in the preceding Section 17-21 shall be revised and adjusted for calendar year 2018 to assure adequacy in the cost of maintaining the City sewer works in sound physical and financial condition necessary to render adequate and effective service.

(1)  Wellhead Protection Area. 
a.  Purpose. The Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) is designed to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare of the people served by a CPWS by regulating the storage, handling, use and/or production of potential sources of contamination within such areas. The intent of a WHPA is to protect the community's potable water supply against damage. All regulated activities within the WHPA shall be in conformance with the requirements of the County Board of Health, the State of Indiana Wellhead Protection Program adopted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and 327 IAC 8-4.1, "The Wellhead Protection Rule". 
b.  Determination of WHPA. WHPA's shall be delineated by the CPWS's in accordance with criteria established in 327 IAC 8-4-1-5. Each WHPA delineated in accordance with requirements of 327 IAC 8-4.1, includes two (2) zones, Zone 1 and Zone 2. Zone 1 is the 200-foot minimum horizontal radius at the ground line surrounding each well. Zone 2 is the five-year TOT less Zone 1. 
    In case of multiple wells in a single well field, defined as having wells at less than 1,000-foot separation distance, the PWS will delineate the entire well field as one (1) WHPA. 
    After approval of Zones 1 and 2, as defined above, by IDEM, the CPWS may submit the delineations to the Health Department for inclusion in this program. Additionally, each individual WHPA will be shown on a map accessible to the public at the location or proposed location of any existing or proposed CPWS according to the specifications of the Health Officer. However, provisions of this section shall not apply if the subject well field is not operating within eighteen (18) months of such an approval. 
    Such WHPA maps shall be amended from time to time as necessary. Such maps shall be supplemented by the CPWS with documentation to substantiate the delineations, if requested by the Health Officer. 
c.  Determination of applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the land within WHPA's as shown on the appropriate maps. 
d.  Posting of WHPA. The WHPA shall be posted by the appropriate CPWS, as directed by the Health Officer, on major thoroughfares with appropriate signs at the borders of the designated areas. 
(2)  Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) permit. 
a.  Exemptions from WHPA permit. Properties that have no activities or have only activities which are limited to the following SIC codes are exempt from the requirements of this section except as provided in subsection 2. below: 
1.  General exemptions: 
53 (General Merchandise Stores) 54 (Food Stores) 56 (Apparel and Accessory Stores) 57 (Home Furniture, Furnishings, and Equipment Stores) 58 (Eating and Drinking Places) 59 (Miscellaneous Retail) 60 (Depository Institutions) 61 (Nondepository Credit Institutions) 62 (Security and Commodity Brokers, Dealers, Exchanges and Services) 63 (Insurance Carriers) 64 (Insurance Agents, Brokers and Services) 65 (Real Estate) 67 (Holding and Other Investment Offices) 70 (Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps and Other Lodging Places) 72 (Personal Services) 73 (Business Services) 78 (Motion Pictures) 82 (Educational Services) 83 (Social Services) 86 (Membership Organizations) 87 (Engineering, Accounting, Research, Management and Related Services) 88 (Private Households) 89 (Miscellaneous Services) 91 (Executive, Legislative, and General Government, Except Finance) 92 (Justice, Public Order and Safety) 93 (Public Finance, Taxation and Monetary Policy) 94 (Administration of Human Resource Programs) 96 (Administration of Economic Programs)  
    The word "property" as used herein means a single contiguous property. Additional properties, as determined by the Water Resources Advisory Board and listed by the Health Department shall be exempt from the requirements of this rule. 
2.  Exceptions to exemptions: 
i.  Properties that possess one (1) or more dry well or any underground storage tank shall not be exempted from the requirements of this section.

(f)  Reporting requirements substitution. In the case where a report requiring information of the same character must be filed to meet a State or Federal requirement, the report may be copied and submitted to the Health Officer in lieu of otherwise applicable reporting requirements under this section. Any of the above information required, not included in the report, must be submitted additionally. 
(g)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Authority to adopt rules and regulations. The County Board of Health may adopt, amend or rescind any such rules and regulations and standards as deemed necessary for proper enforcement and to carry out the purposes and intent of this section.

Upon receipt of such petition, the Health Officer shall arrange a time and place for such hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. Such hearing shall be held as soon as practicable after the receipt of a request therefor. At such hearing the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why such notice should not be complied with. 
(5)  Issuance of order; revocation of permit. After such hearing, the County Board of Health shall sustain, modify, or withdraw the notice, depending upon his/her findings as to whether the provisions of this section have been complied with. If the Health Officer shall sustain or modify such notice in writing, it shall be deemed to be an order. Any notice properly served shall automatically become an order if a written petition for a hearing is not filed in the Office of the Health Officer within the fifteen (15) days after such notice is served. After a hearing in the case of any notice suspending any permit required by this section, when such notice has been sustained by the County Board of Health, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit which has been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if a petition for hearing is not filed in the Office of the Health Officer within fifteen (15) days after such notice is served. 
(6)  Issuance of emergency orders and permits. Whenever the Health Officer finds that an emergency exists which requires immediate action to protect the public health, the Health Officer may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and requiring that such action be taken as the Health Officer deems necessary to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, such order shall be effective immediately. Any person receiving such an order may seek a hearing under subsections (d) and (e) while carrying out such order and shall have the right to recover any of its response costs to the extent that the order or any portion thereof is found to have been arbitrary or capricious or not otherwise in accordance with law. After such consideration, depending upon the finding as to whether the provisions of this section have been complied with, the Health Officer shall continue such order in effect, modify it or revoke it. 
(h)  Ordinance review. The Water Resources Advisory Board shall formally review section 17-48.1 of this Code as necessary but at least every four (4) years. This review shall assess the performance of the section as it fulfills its statement of purpose and intent. Additionally, the review shall identity new Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, new technologies, and new best management practices that apply to the section. The results of the review along with any recommendations shall be submitted in writing to the St. Joseph County Board of Health. 
(i)  Variances. The County Board of Health shall consider a petition for variances, exemptions, and exceptions from provisions of this section, the Well Drilling and Water Supply Systems Ordinance and the Source Water Supply Ordinance, after review by the Water Resources Advisory Board, and in no case later than sixty (60) days after the petition is filed. An adverse decision by the Health Board is a final order and is appealable. 
(j)  Penalties. Any person found to be violating any provision of this section shall be served by the Health Department with a written order stating the nature of the violation and providing a time limit for satisfactory correction.

    Any person violating any provisions of this section shall become liable to the Health Department for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned it by reason of such violation. 
(k)  Severability. If any section or part of this section or Code be for any reason held unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the section or Code, but the remaining portions shall be and remain in full force and effect. 
(l)  Disclaimer of liability. The section shall not create liability on the part of the Health Department or any officer, employee or agent thereof for any damage which may result from reliance on this section or on any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
    All inspections shall be at the discretion of the Health Officer and nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Health Officer to conduct any inspection, nor shall any inspection imply a duty to conduct any other inspection. Nothing in this section shall be construed to hold the Health Officer responsible for any damage to persons or property by any failure to make an inspection or reinspection.

ARTICLE 10. - WATER AND SEWER INSTALLATION CONSTRUCTION FEES 

Sec. 17-79. - System Development Charge for Wastewater inside and outside City limits. 
(1)  For purposes of this section "ERU" shall be defined as an equivalent residential unit which means a single family residence. For purposes of customers that are not single family residences, one (1) ERU shall equal estimated wastewater flows of three hundred ten (310) gallons per day. No customer will be less than one (1) ERU. There will be no partial ERU's. The City shall round down to the closest applicable ERU calculation at all times. 
(2)  Except as provided in Subsections (5) and (6) of this section, for every new connection to the South Bend Municipal Sewer Works, a system development charge of one thousand one hundred forty-five dollars ($1,145.00) shall be collected per ERU and additional portion thereof to be connected. All charges shall be billed by the City at the time the application for service is filed. 
(3)  System development charges per ERU shall also be collected from existing customers undertaking activities producing a permanent increase in wastewater flow of greater than three hundred ten (310) gallons per day. This subsection shall not apply to an existing customer who has, by contract, purchased reserved capacity from the City so long as the customer's flows remain within the reserved capacity. A permanent increase shall be deemed to have occurred when the average flow rate for six (6) consecutive months exceeds the current flow rate by at least three hundred ten (310) gallons per day. 
(4)  For multifamily structures (e.g., apartments, condominiums, mobile home communities), each individual unit shall be one (1) ERU. For all other types of structures, the ERU calculation shall be based upon the ratio of Average Daily Flow as computed pursuant to 327 IAC 3-6-11 in relationship to three hundred ten (310) gallons per day. For structures not listed in 327 IAC 3-6-11, the ERU shall be calculated as the relationship between the Average Daily Flow reported in the sewer capacity certification for the structure and three hundred then (310) gallons per day. 
(5)  For customers with greater than twenty (20) ERUs as calculated pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the ERU shall be adjusted based upon the Peaking Factor as computed herein. The Peaking Factor shall be calculated by dividing the Peak Daily Flow by the Average Daily Flow, both as reported in the sewer capacity certification. In no event will a Peaking Factor less than 2.0 be used for purposes of the adjustment described in this subsection. The Peaking Factor divided by 4.0 (the Peaking Factor for residential connections) will be multiplied by the number of ERUs for purposes of computing the system development charge owed by the customer. The City Board of Works may execute a contract with the customer authorizing an increase to the initial System Development Charge based upon actual usage data that is collected after connection. 
(6)  Where a prospective customer seeks to connect a new structure on property which replaces a prior structure of a similar use what was located on the same property and which was connected to the South Bend Municipal Sewer Works, no system development charge will be collected. For instance, if the prior structure was a single family structure and the new structure is to be used as a multi-family structure, a system development charge, as contemplated herein this section, shall be charged. The Board of Public Works shall make the final determination of whether the new property structure is a similar use to the prior property structure for the purposes of this subsection.

Sec. 17-91. - Prohibited illegal discharges; exceptions. 
(a)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the City's storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
(b)  The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one (1) PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(Ord. No. 9542-04, §§ I, II) 
Sec. 17-92. - Prohibited illicit connections. 
    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the City's separate storm sewer system (MS4) is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the City's separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 9542-04, §§ I, II) 
Sec. 17-93. - Suspension of access to city's separate storm sewer system (MS4). 
(a)  The City may, without prior notice, suspend a person's access to the City's separate storm sewer system (MS4) when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(c)  A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the City.

(3)  Third violation means the determination that after five (5) working days past the notification of a second violation, the condition or conditions constituting the second violation remain uncorrected or otherwise noncompliant with the requirements, provisions, or regulations of the ordinance. Upon ascertaining and documenting the occurrence of a third violation at a project site, the City will issue another non-compliance citation to the owner/developer together with a notice that the project site is subject to an immediate "stop work" order. The civil penalty for a third violation will be no less than five hundred dollars ($500.00). If the penalty is not paid within thirty (30) days, the citation may be enforced in court by any remedy allowed by law and an action may be maintained to recover the costs of corrective measures employed by the City, if the owner/developer does not make a good faith effort to correct the violation, in addition to the fine or penalty referred to above. 
(b)  Stop work orders will not be rescinded until all recommended corrective measures have been completed and the City has been paid for all costs incurred, as applicable. 
(c)  The City reserves the right to accelerate the schedule assigned in this section for correcting a violation if required to protect life or property from an eminent and severe threat of loss or damage. 
(d)  The City may perform, or cause to be performed, such work as is necessary to accomplish corrective measures at a project site by their own forces or by a contractor hired to perform the work. 
(e)  Any project site owner, individual lot operator, contractor, subcontractor, property owner, or other person or persons responsible for construction activities at a project site who violate the terms, requirements, provisions, or regulations of this ordinance are liable for the costs of removal of sediment and other storm water pollutants deposited in any right-of-way, drain, storm sewer, drainage easement, or City maintained or controlled property to a condition equal to or better than the condition prior to a violation.

ARTICLE 13. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL 

Sec. 17-119. - Legislative findings. 
    This Article meets the post construction stormwater runoff requirements of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13-16). As a result, the purpose of this local ordinance is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land within the City of South Bend MS4 area (includes the Ivy Tech Community College Campus). 
(1)  Applicability. This Article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications. The Article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even thought multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed by the City of South Bend's Division of Engineering to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans. To prevent the adverse effects of stormwater runoff, the City of South Bend has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one (1) acre (forty-three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet) or more of land. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria: 
a.  Additions or modification to existing single-family structures. 
b.  Developments that do not disturb one (1) acre or more, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan. 
c.  Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by the City of South Bend. 
When a site development plan is submitted, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special storm water sizing criteria established in IDEM's Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the City of South Bend Design and Construction Standards. Final authorization of all development projects will be determined after a review by the City of South Bend's Division of Engineering. The City of South Bend also reserves the right to request submission of a site development plan if the City Engineer or his designee deems necessary and notifies the site owner in writing. 
(2)  Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements. This Article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this Article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this Article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall be considered to take precedence. 
(3)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision, or clause of this Article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this Article.

Attention to urban design features, therefore, is determined by the Common Council of the City of South Bend to be in the best economic interest of the citizens and business owners of the City of South Bend. 
Signs , due to their inherent visibility and incursion upon the urban landscape, represent a prominent urban design feature. The regulations contained in Section 21-07.03 - Sign Regulations of this Ordinance were prepared in recognition of the impact of signs as a prominent urban design feature. The intent the Sign Regulations of this Ordinance is, in part: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the City of South Bend; to create a more attractive economic and business climate; to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; to foster and improve the economic vitality of the community by enhancing and protecting the physical appearance of the community; and, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.

ARTICLE 7. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 
SECTION 21-07. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 

Section 21-07.01. - Landscape Regulations. 
Intent - Landscaping is an essential element of the site design process and is an important feature in promoting the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the City of South Bend. Landscaping is intended to: mitigate incompatibilities between adjacent land uses; reduce the negative impacts of higher intensity land uses on less intense adjacent land uses; provide a critical visual and noise buffering effect between higher intensity districts and less intense districts ; lessen the impact of development on the environment by reducing glare and heat buildup; and, break up large expanses of pavement so as to reduce impervious surface area, storm water run-off and the level of pollutants from non-point sources. 
(a)  General Landscaping Provisions. 
(1)  Applicability - Within the City of South Bend, all new developments and all additions to existing development (i.e., building additions, parking area expansions, etc.) shall provide landscaping as required by this Section for such new development or addition. 
(2)  Location of Landscaping - Required landscaping areas shall consist of four (4) locations on a site: (i) landscaping of required perimeter yards or residential bufferyards ; (ii) foundation landscaping ; (iii) interior parking area landscaping; and, (iv) parking area screening. To the fullest extent possible, landscaping shall be placed on the development site. When circumstances dictate that landscaping required by this Section can only be placed in the public right-of-way to meet the requirements of this Section, permission must be sought and obtained from the Board of Public Works and City Arborist prior to the placement of the landscaping within the right-of-way . 
(3)  Types of Landscape Screening - Three (3) types of landscape screening are provided for in this Section: (i) Type A: Open; (ii) Type B: Partial Screening; and, (iii) Type C: Full Screening. These three (3) types of landscape screening are intended to provide a progression of screening options suitable to a variety of landscaping and buffering needs between land uses and districts . 
(A)  Type A: Open - The Type A: Open landscaping creates a pleasant visual experience but provides a minimal visual or sound barrier. Therefore, Type A: Open landscaping is intended for use on lots where the district of the abutting lots includes permitted uses with similar intensities, lights, sounds and regular operations and would have minimal, if any, negative impact on adjacent properties. Type A: Open landscaping requires a majority of the landscape materials to be of a shade tree variety with flexibility to add color, interest or heavier visual screening, if desired. 
(B)  Type B: Partial Screening - The Type B: Partial Screening landscaping creates a partial visual and sound barrier and is intended for use on lots where the district of the abutting lots includes permitted uses that may be similar in land use intensity, but may still contain lights, sounds and regular operations which may adversely impact adjacent properties. Type B: Partial Screening landscaping requires the use of evergreen trees to provide year-round buffering while allowing flexibility to add color and interest with deciduous trees or shrubs/hedge plants. 
(C)  Type C: Full Screening - The Type C: Full Screening landscaping shall be designed to create a substantial visual barrier from grade to at least six (6) feet above grade at time of planting. Type C: Full Screening landscaping should also provide a sound barrier effect. Type C: Full Screening landscaping is intended to be placed on lots in higher intensity districts which abut lots located in lesser intense districts that may be adversely impacted by the lights, sounds and regular operations of the higher intensity district . Type C: Full Screening landscaping requires significant use of evergreen trees to provide year-round buffering while allowing flexibility to add color and interest with deciduous trees or shrubs/hedge plants. Any evergreen species that drops its lower branches (e.g., white pines, etc.) shall not be permitted as a "evergreen" tree in a Type C: Full Screening landscape area.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 10405-15, §§ I, II, adopted Nov. 23, 2015 repealed Ch. 21, Art. 12 and reenacted a new article as set out herein. Former Art. 12 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 10037-10, §§ 1, 2, 9-13-10; Ord. No. 10072-11, § I, 2-14-11. 

SECTION - 21-12. FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS 

Section 21-12.01. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives. 
(1)  Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of City of South Bend, Indiana does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(2)  Findings of fact. 
(A)  The flood hazard areas of the City of South Bend, Indiana are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(B)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(3)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(A)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(B)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(C)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(D)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; 
(E)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(F)  Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City of South Bend, Indiana by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(4)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(A)  To protect human life and health; 
(B)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(C)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(D)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(E)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains; and 
(F)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas. 
(Ord. No. 10405-15, §§ I, II, 11-23-15) 
Section 21-12.02. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. In addition to the definitions contained in Article 11-Definitions, the following definitions shall apply to the Floodplain Regulations of this Chapter. 
(1)  A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below: 
Zone A : Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent (1%) annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. 
Zone AE and A1-A30 : Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent (1%) annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30). 
Zone AO : Areas subject to inundation by one-percent (1%) annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AH : Areas subject to inundation by one-percent (1%) annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AR : Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. 
Zone A99 : Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent (1%) annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. 
(2)  Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area four hundred (400) square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
(3)  Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
(4)  Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
(5)  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
(6)  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
(7)  Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent (%) annual chance flood. 
(8)  Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
(9)  Boundary River means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between Kentucky and Indiana. 
(10)  Boundary River floodway means the floodway of a boundary river. 
(11)  Building, see " Structure ." 
(12)  Community means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
(13)  Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
(14)  Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
(15)  D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this zone. 
(16)  Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to: 
(A)  Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure; 
(B)  Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days; 
(C)  Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects;

(E)  Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations; 
(F)  Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts; 
(G)  Storage of materials; or 
(H)  Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters. 
"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures. 
(17)  Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
(18)  Elevation certificate is a certified statement that verifies a structure's elevation information. 
(19)  Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
(20)  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
(21)  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
(22)  FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(23)  Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(24)  Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway. 
(25)  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
(26)  Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
(27)  Flood prone area means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See "Flood") 
(28)  Flood protection grade (FPG) is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See "Freeboard") 
(29)  Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts. 
(30)  Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
(31)  Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements. 
(32)  Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces. 
(33)  Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect. 
(34)  Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream. 
(35)  Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. 
(36)  Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. 
(37)  Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Area Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
(38)  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
(39)  Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
(40)  Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage. 
(41)  Letter of final determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause. 
(42)  Letter of map change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are set forth as follows: 
(A)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment to the currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property-specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA. 
(B)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations. 
(C)  Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA. 
(43)  Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
(44)  Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following: 
(A)  The top of the lowest level of the structure. 
(B)  The top of the basement floor. 
(C)  The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure. 
(D)  The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars. 
(E)  The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless: 
i.  The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two (2) openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two (2) exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls; 
ii.  The total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and 
iii.  Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access. 
(46)  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
(47)  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
(48)  Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values. 
(49)  Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery. 
(50)  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry. 
(51)  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
(52)  New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
(53)  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
(54)  Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary river. 
(55)  North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
(56)  Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
(57)  One-percent annual chance flood is the flood that has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent (1%) annual chance flood. See "Regulatory Flood". 
(58)  Physical map revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent (1%) annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs. 
(59)  Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
(60)  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: (1) built on a single chassis; (2) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
(61)  Regular program means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
(62)  Regulatory flood means the flood having a one-percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in Subsection 21-12.03(2) of this article. The "Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood", "One-Percent Annual Chance Flood", and "100-Year Flood". 
(63)  Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(64)  Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
(65)  Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the City of South bend, Indiana subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of South Bend are generally identified as such on the St. Joseph County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 6, 2011 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO). 
(66)  Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(67)  Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
(68)  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(69)  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
(70)  Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
(71)  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(72)  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(73)  Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(74)  X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent. 
(75)  Zone means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
(76)  Zone A (see definition for "A zone"). 
(77)  Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C).

(B)  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of South Bend, Indiana, delineated as an "A Zone" on the St. Joseph County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 6, 2011 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved. 
(C)  In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. 
(D)  Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA. 
(3)  Establishment of floodplain development permit. A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard. 
(4)  Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(6)  Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations. 
(A)  In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern. 
(B)  If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly. 
(C)  If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA. 
(7)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
(A)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(B)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(C)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(8)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this article does not create any liability on the part of the City of South Bend, Indiana, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(9)  Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this article. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code of the City of South Bend, Indiana. All violations shall be punishable by a fine (See Subsection 21-10(h) Fines). 
(A)  A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. 
(B)  The City of South Bend Zoning Administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended. 
(C)  Nothing herein shall prevent the City of South Bend, Indiana from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

i.  These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood: 
a.  The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in Subsection 21-12.05(2)(D). 
c.  Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings. 
ii.  These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood: 
a.  The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in Subsection 21-12.05(2)(D).

(F)  All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders). 
(4)  Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(5)  Standards for identified floodways. 
(A)  Located within SFHAs, established in Subsection 21-12.03(2) of this article, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources). 
(B)  No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section 21-12.05 of this article have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence. 
(C)  No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses. 
(D)  For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City of South Bend, Indiana shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12. 
(6)  Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Section 21-12.05 of this article have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. 
(7)  Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes. 
(A)  Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: 
i.  If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment. 
ii.  No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
iii.  Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in Section 21-12.05 of this article have been met. 
(B)  Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square mile: 
(i)  If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and one-percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation for the site. 
(ii)  Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section 21-12.05 of this article have been met. 
(C)  The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than fourteen-hundredths (0.14) of one (1) foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. 
(8)  Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet general standards as required per Section 21-12.05. 
(Ord. No. 10405-15, §§ I, II, 11-23-15) 
Section 21-12.06. - Variance procedures. 
(1)  Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The St. Joseph County Area Board of Zoning Appeals (ABZA) shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this article. 
(2)  Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board (ABZA) shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board (ABZA) may appeal such decision to the St. Joseph County Circuit or Superior Court. 
(3)  Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the Board (ABZA) shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(A)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(B)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(C)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(D)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(E)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(F)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(G)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(H)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(I)  The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site; and 
(J)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(4)  Conditions for variances. 
(A)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
i.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
