PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Doral, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Barbara Herrera, City Clerk, Jimmy Morales, City Attorney, and Jacob Horowitz, former Assistant City Attorney, and the other members of the city's staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before October 14, 2009, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are hereby repealed. The repeal provided for herein shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this Ordinance. 
    Section 3. The City Council hereby acknowledges that (a) any additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate an intention to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments, and (b) ordinances adopted after October 14, 2009, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided in the Code, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500, a term of imprisonment not to exceed sixty (60) days or both a fine and term of imprisonment.

PREAMBLE 
    We, the people of the City of Doral, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits and responsibilities of Home Rule, and in order to provide a municipal government to serve our present and future needs, and recognizing that the City exists for the purpose of providing for the health, education, safety and welfare of its citizenry, do hereby adopt this Charter. The City Council and all of its boards, committees, commissions and employees shall at all times conduct themselves in accordance with common courtesy and consistent with the Code of Ethics of the state of Florida and Miami-Dade County. 
(Ord. No. 2009-17 , § 4(Exh. 1), 1-6-2010/3-9-2010) 
CITIZENS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
(A)  This government has been created to protect the governed, not the governing. In order to provide the public with full and accurate information, to promote efficient administration management, to make government more accountable, and to insure to all persons fair and equitable treatment, the following rights are guaranteed: 
(1)  Convenient Access. Every person has the right to transact City business with a minimum of personal inconvenience. It shall be the duty of the Mayor, the City Council and the City Manager to provide, within budgetary limitations, reasonably convenient times and places for registration and voting, for required inspections, and for transacting business with the City. 
(2)  Truth in Government. No municipal official or employee shall knowingly furnish false information on any public matter, nor knowingly omit significant facts when giving requested information to members of the public. 
(3)  Public Records. Records of the City, its boards, agencies, departments and authorities shall be open for inspection at reasonable times and places convenient to the public, to the extent required by law. 
(4)  Minutes and Ordinance Register. The City Clerk shall maintain and make available for public inspection a register separate from the minutes showing the votes of each Councilmember on all ordinances and resolutions listed by descriptive title. The register shall be available for public inspection not later than 60 days after the conclusion of the meeting at which action was taken. 
(5)  Right to be Heard. So far as the orderly conduct of public business permits, any interested person has the right to appear before the City Council or City agency, board or department for the presentation, adjustment or determination of an issue, request, or controversy within the jurisdiction of the City. Matters shall be scheduled for the convenience of the public. The City Council shall adopt agenda procedures and schedule hearings in a manner that will enhance the opportunity for public participation. Nothing herein shall prohibit any governmental entity or agency from imposing reasonable time limits and procedures for the presentation of a matter. 
(6)  Right to Notice. Persons entitled to notice of a City hearing shall be timely informed as to the time, place and nature of the hearing and the legal authority pursuant to which the hearing is to be held. Failure by an individual to receive such notice shall not constitute mandatory grounds for canceling the hearing or rendering invalid any determination made at such hearing. Copies of proposed ordinances or resolutions shall be made available at a reasonable time prior to the hearing, unless the matter involves an emergency ordinance or resolution. 
(7)  No Unreasonable Postponements. No matter, once having been placed on a formal agenda by the City, shall be postponed to another date except for good cause shown. 
(8)  Right to Public Hearing. Upon a timely written request from any interested party, and after presentation of the facts to and approval by the Council, a public hearing shall be held upon any significant policy decision which is not subject to subsequent administrative or legislative review and hearing. 
At any zoning or other hearing in which review is exclusively by certiorari, a party or his/her counsel shall be entitled to present his/her case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The decision of such agency, board, department or authority must be based upon the facts in the record. Procedural rules establishing reasonable time and other limitations may be promulgated and amended from time to time. 
(9)  Notice of Action and Reasons. Prompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a request of an interested person made in connection with any City administrative decision or proceeding when the decision is reserved at the conclusion of the hearing. The notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the grounds for denial. 
(10)  Managers' Report. The City Manager shall periodically make a public status report on all major matters pending or concluded within his/her area of concern. 
(11)  Budgeting. In addition to any budget required by state law, the City Manager, at the direction of the Mayor, shall prepare a budget showing the cost of each department for each budget year. Prior to the City Council's first public hearing on the proposed budget required by state law, the City Manager shall issue a budget summary setting forth the proposed cost of each individual department and reflecting the personnel for each department, the purposes therefore, the estimated millage cost of each department and the amount of any contingency and carryover funds for each department. 
(12)  Quarterly Budget Comparisons. The City Manager shall issue a quarterly report showing the actual expenditures during the quarter just ended against one quarter of the proposed annual expenditures set forth in the budget. Such report shall also reflect the same cumulative information for the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed. 
(B)  The foregoing enumeration of citizens' rights vests large and pervasive powers in the citizenry of the City. Such power necessarily carries with it responsibility of equal magnitude for the successful operation of government in the City. The orderly, efficient and fair operation of government requires the participation of individual citizens exercising their rights with dignity and restraint so as to avoid any sweeping acceleration in the cost of government because of the exercise of individual prerogatives, and for individual citizens to grant respect for the dignity of public office. 
(C)  All provisions of this Bill of Rights shall be construed to be supplementary to and not in conflict with the general laws of Florida.

(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 1, 11-9-2005/1-24-2006) 
Sec. 9.7. - Continuing Obligations as to County Bonds. 
    The County has previously issued $41,580,000.00 Stormwater Utility Revenue Bond Series 1999 (the "Stormwater Bond") of which $38,805,000.00 remains outstanding as of May 1st, 2002, payable from stormwater utility fees collected in the unincorporated area and within a limited number of cities. The County assesses and collects the stormwater utility fee pursuant to Sections 24-61 through 24-61.5 of the County Code, as amended from time to time and Section 403.0893, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time (the "Stormwater Utility Fees). 
    The County has issued $77,640,000 Public Service Tax Revenue Bonds (UMSA Public Improvements) Series 1999 (the "Series 1999 Public Service Bonds") currently outstanding in the principal amount of $71,295,000 and has issued an additional series of bonds in an amount not to exceed $60,000,000 (the "Series 2002 Public Service Bonds") prior to the City's incorporation payable from Public Service Taxes (defined below) collected in the unincorporated area. The County receives a public service tax pursuant to Section 166.231, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, and as of October 1, 2001, from a discretionary communications tax assessed pursuant to Chapter 202, Florida Statutes and Section 29 of the County Code (collectively, "The Public Service Tax"). If required by the County within 180 days of the adoption of this Chapter, the City agrees to enact an ordinance, pursuant to Section 202.19, Florida Statues, authorizing the levy of the discretionary services tax at a rate no less than the rate established by the County for communications services prior to the incorporation of the City. 
    The Stormwater Bonds, the Series 1996 Public Service Bonds, the Series 1999 Public Service Bonds, the Series 2002 Public Service Bonds, and any bonds issued in the future, provided that the City remains a part of the Stormwater utility system, that are secured either through Stormwater Utility Fees or Public Service Taxes ("Fees and Taxes") are referred to collectively in this Section as the "Bonds". 
    The City agrees that until the Bonds are retired the County shall have the right to receive and apply to debt service on the Bonds all of the Fees and Taxes collected within the unincorporated area and within the boundaries of the City. After the County has paid or satisfied the monthly debt service requirements on the Bonds, the County shall make a payment to the City, equal to its share of the remaining Fees and Taxes on deposit with the County. The City's share shall be all Fees and Taxes collected within the City annually minus its Debt Service Share. The City's Debt Service Share is determined by expressing the Fees and Taxes collected within the City at the time of incorporation as a percentage of the total Fees and Taxes collected within the unincorporated area at the time of incorporation and any municipalities incorporated after 1998 and apply that percentage to the total annual debt service on the Bonds. The City may prepay its proportionate share of the aforementioned bonds at any time during the life of the bonds with out penalty. 
    The intent of this section is to ensure that the City continues to collect revenues on behalf of the County which were collected by the County prior to the incorporation of the City and which were pledged and relied upon to pay for capital improvements provided by the County to the then existing unincorporated area to the benefit of the City. 
Sec. 9.8. - Favored Nation Status. 
County Services. 
If a subsequent incorporation is approved without the newly incorporated area being required to remain in the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue District, Miami-Dade Library System, Miami-Dade Solid Waste collection service area, or without contracting with the Miami-Dade Police Department for local patrol police services, the City will be entitled to modify its relationship with the County, so that the city will not be required to receive that particular service from the County. Both parties also agree that if a subsequent incorporation of any area is approved without conditions outlined in this agreement, and those terms would be beneficial to the City of Doral, the terms under this Charter will immediately be replaced with the terms granted to the subsequent, new, municipality (the "Most Favored Nation Status"). It is provided, however, that the Most Favored Nation Status shall not apply to mitigation payments into the Municipal Services Trust Fund, nor apply to any requirement to separately contract or pay for the provision of specialized police services. 
The provisions of this section, apply only to the service or services modified, and in no way alter the agreement regarding the remaining services. 
(Ord. No. 2009-12, exh. 1, 4-22-2009) 
Sec. 9.9. - Rights of the City. 
    The City will be granted all rights powers and privileges afforded to all municipalities and provided under the general laws of the State of Florida subject only to the restrictions placed upon it by this Charter. The City will receive all other municipal revenue sources such as utility taxes including those that the County by right or may otherwise retain, such as the franchise fees, and will continue to receive all services that are provided to cities under the countywide budget. 
Sec. 9.10. - Modifications. 
    Any modifications to Article IX will require: 
(1)  All approvals normally required by the municipal charter, and 
(2)  Approval by 2/3rds of the total membership of the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners.

(5)  A good faith effort to employ candidates residing within the municipal boundaries shall constitute, at a minimum, evaluating the qualification of such candidates, and conducting interviews with those candidates who satisfy the minimum competency requirements. 
(6)  In determining whether the contractor has made good faith efforts, the City may consider, among other criteria to be set forth in the implementing order: 
a.  The number, skills, and composition of the contractor's labor force ultimately hired; 
b.  Whether minimum requirements were established for available positions beyond reasonable requirements to complete the job; 
c.  The number of qualified candidates interviewed for the position; and 
d.  The contractor's coordination with CSSF to satisfy its labor needs. 
e.  Financial reports submitted by contractor that substantiates that 2.5% of the total bid amount has been expended on local businesses.

(f)  Compliance with filing requirements. Failure of a party to file the protest or submit the filing fee on a timely basis shall constitute a forfeiture of such party's right to file a protest pursuant to this section.

Sec. 2-371. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  High moral and ethical standards among public officials, both elected and appointed, and public employees are essential to gain and maintain the confidence of the public because such confidence is essential to the conduct of free government. They are the agents of the people and hold their positions for the benefit of the people. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent and impartial when establishing policy and that their positions never be used for personal gain. 
(b)  All elected and appointed officials, city employees, and others who participate in the city's government are required to subscribe to this chapter and the conflict of interest and code of ethics ordinance codified as subsection 2-11.1 of the Code of Miami-Dade County.

(a)  This article is designed to address the manner in which public officials should treat one another, city staff, constituents, and others they come into contact with in representing the city. 
(b)  Public officials are called upon to exhibit appropriate behavior at all times. Demonstrating respect for each individual through words and actions is the touchstone that can help guide public officials to take appropriate actions even in the most difficult situations. The city's code of conduct includes the following minimum standards. 
(1)  Uphold the United States and Florida Constitutions, laws and regulations and the city's Charter, ordinances and regulations, and never knowingly be a party to their evasion. 
(2)  Place the city's rules, codes and interests ahead of any group or individual interests or concerns. No public official shall put individual concerns or interests before those of the city and this Code, before, during or after making a recommendation or a decision on a pending application.

(5)  Ensure the integrity of the actions of each board, committee or the city council by avoiding discrimination through the dispensing of special favors, or unfair privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not.

No appointed public official shall advocate, lobby, or take any action involving the community or the city council on an item that has been considered or is to be heard by that appointed public official's board or committee. The appointed board or committee, as a whole, shall issue a recommendation in its official capacity to the city council. The individual appointed board or committee members shall not advocate to the public, or appear before the city council on an item upon which their respective board or committee will consider or has considered, as doing so would provide an appearance of undue influence, bias and improper conduct. An appointed public official may only appear before the city council on matters considered or to be considered by their respective board or committee if specifically invited by the council to do so. Appointed public officials may, however, appear before the city council on all other city business. 
(8)  Never use any information gained confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means of making private profit. 
(9)  Expose through appropriate means and channels, corruption, misconduct or neglect of duty whenever discovered. 
(10)  Adhere to the principle that the public's business should be conducted consistent with the Sunshine Law and following the letter and spirit of the Sunshine Law by using closed meetings only to deal with certain legal and labor matters as provided under state law.

(13)  Pledge to honor and uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office (whether appointed or elected) is a public trust.

Sec. 2-373. - City meetings.

(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(d), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-374. - Rules of decorum. 
(a)  All public officials shall practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate. Difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action. This does not allow, however, public officials to make belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or disparaging comments. No shouting or physical actions that could be construed as threatening will be tolerated. 
(b)  All public officials shall honor the role of the chair in maintaining order. It is the responsibility of the chair to keep the comments of council members or board members on track during public meetings. Public officials shall honor efforts by the chair to focus discussion on current agenda items and to halt nonproductive grandstanding. If there is disagreement about the agenda or the chair's actions, those objections shall be voiced politely and with reason, following procedures outlined in parliamentary procedure. 
(c)  Avoid personal comments that could offend other persons. If an individual member of the council, board or committee is personally offended by the remarks of another member the offender public officials shall make notes of the actual words used and call for a point of personal privilege that challenges the offending member to justify or apologize for the language used. The chair will maintain control of this discussion. 
(d)  The city council and each public board and committee has a public stage to show how individuals with disparate points of view can find common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the community as a whole. 
(e)  Public officials should refer to one another formally during public meetings by their official titles followed by the individual's last name. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(e), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-375. - Correspondence signatures. 
(a)  Public officials do not need to acknowledge the receipt of correspondence, or copies of correspondence, during council meetings or other official city meetings. City staff will prepare official letters in response to public inquiries and concerns. If correspondence is addressed only to one public official, that public official should check with staff on the best way to respond to the sender. At all times, public officials will make sure to comply with the city's quasi-judicial procedures, comply with the Jennings Rule, and adhere to the state's Sunshine Laws. 
(b)  Public officials are to check with city staff on correspondence before taking action. Before sending correspondence, public officials should check with city staff to see if an official city response has already been sent or is in progress. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(f), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-376. - Conduct with city staff. 
    Governance of a city relies on the cooperative efforts of all public officials. The city council sets policy and the city manager, together with city staff, implements and administers the council's policies. To allow proper governance and to ensure noninterference with the city manager's application or implementation of the city council's policies, public officials shall comply with the following guidelines: 
(1)  Public officials shall treat all staff as professionals with clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience and the dignity of each individual is expected. Public officials shall maintain an attitude of courtesy and consideration toward all colleagues, public officials and staff during all discussions and deliberations. 
(2)  Questions/inquiries to city staff: 
a.  General public official communications with city staff should be limited to normal city business hours unless the circumstances warrant otherwise. Responses to public official questions posed outside of normal business hours should be expected no earlier than the next business day. 
b.  Routine requests for information and inquiries. Public officials may contact staff directly for information made readily available to the general public on a regular basis (e.g., "What are the library's hours of operation?"). Under these circumstances staff shall treat the public official no differently than they would the general public, and the public official shall not use his elected or appointed status to secure preferential treatment. The city Manager does not need to be advised of such contacts. 
c.  Nonroutine requests for readily available information. A public official may also contact staff directly for easily retrievable information not routinely requested by the general public so long as it does not require staff to discuss the issue or express an opinion (e.g., "How many traffic lights are there in the city?"). 
d.  Nonroutine requests requiring special effort. Any public official request or inquiry that requires staff to compile information that is not readily available or easily retrievable and/or that requests staff to express an opinion (legal or otherwise) must be directed to the city manager, (e.g., "Please provide a matrix reconciling data from various traffic and parking studies in Hometown Overlay District"). The city manager shall be responsible for distributing such requests to his staff for follow-up. Responses to such requests shall be copied to all public officials on the board, the city manager, the city attorney as appropriate and affected department heads. The procedure outlined in this subsection does not preclude a public official from making a public records request under F.S. ch. 119. 
e.  Meeting requests. Any public official request for a meeting with staff must be directed to the city manager. When in doubt about the appropriateness of a communication with staff, public officials shall ask the city manager for advice. 
f.  Public safety restrictions. Under certain circumstances, requests for information regarding operations or personnel of the department of public safety may be legally restricted under state law to protect minors, certain victims and law enforcement officers and their investigations. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the city to strictly comply with all applicable legal authorities governing the release of public safety information and records. 
(3)  Do not disrupt city staff from their jobs. Public officials should not disrupt city staff while they are engrossed in performing their job functions in order to have their individual needs met. 
(4)  Never publicly criticize an individual employee. Public officials shall never express concerns about the performance of a city employee in public, to the employee directly, or to the employee's manager. Comments about staff performance should only be made to the city manager through private correspondence or conversation. 
(5)  Public officials shall not become involved in administrative functions. Public officials shall not attempt to influence city staff on the making of appointments, awarding of contracts, selecting of consultants, processing of development applications, or granting of city licenses and permits. 
(6)  Public officials shall not attend meetings with city staff unless requested by staff. This restriction does not apply to board or committee members sitting in on meetings concerning matters that do not come before their respective boards or committees for consideration. 
(7)  Requests for staff support shall be made to the city manager who is responsible for allocating city resources. 
(8)  Public officials shall not solicit political support from staff. Public officials should not solicit any type of political support (financial contributions, display of posters or lawn signs, name on support list, etc.) from city staff. City staff may, as private citizens with constitutional rights, support political candidates but all such activities must be done away from the workplace. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(g), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-377. - Same-Members of the public. 
(a)  Make no promises on behalf of the entire body. Public officials will frequently be asked to explain an action of the body or to give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to give a brief overview of city policy and to refer to city staff for further information. It is inappropriate to overtly or implicitly promise action by the body, or to promise city staff will do something specific (fix a pothole, remove a library book, plant new flowers in the median, etc.). 
(b)  Make no personal comments about other public officials. It is acceptable to publicly disagree about an issue, but it is unacceptable to make derogatory comments about other public officials, their opinions and actions. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(h), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-378. - Same-Other public agencies. 
(a)  Public officials should be clear about representing the city, a board of the city or personal interests. If a public official appears before another governmental agency or organization or meets with the agency representative or staff to give a statement on an issue, the public official must clearly state: 
(1)  If his statement reflects personal opinion or is the official stance of the city; 
(2)  Whether this is the majority or minority opinion of the body he represents. If the public official is representing the city, the public official must support and advocate the official city position on an issue, not a personal viewpoint. 
(b)  Correspondence also should be equally clear about representation. City letterhead may be used when the public official is representing the city and the city's official position. A copy of official correspondence should be given to the city clerk to be filed in the council office as part of the permanent public record. It is best that city letterhead not be used for correspondence of public officials representing a personal point of view or a dissenting point of view from an official city council or city board position. However, should public officials use city letterhead to express a personal opinion, the official city position must be stated clearly so the reader understands the difference between the official city position and the minor viewpoint of the public official. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(i), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-379. - Same-Boards and councils. 
(a)  Public officials may generally attend any public meeting, which are always open to any member of the public. There are specific exceptions in the case of quasi-judicial proceedings. If in doubt, the official should seek guidance from the city attorney's office. However, public officials should be sensitive to the way their participation could be viewed as unfairly affecting the process. No public comments by an appointed public official at a city council meeting may be made where the board or committee's recommendation is presented, unless that board or committee member is specifically invited to speak by the mayor or by the council. 
(b)  It is inappropriate for a public official to contact a committee, board or council member to lobby on behalf of businesses or developers. Nor is it acceptable for public officials to contact board or council members in order to clarify a position taken by their respective committee, board or council. Any such contact should occur in compliance with this section and the state's Sunshine law requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(j[1]), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-380. - Council conduct with the media. 
    Public officials are frequently contacted by the media for background and quotes. Most members of the media represent the highest levels of journalistic integrity and ethics and can be trusted to keep their word. But one bad experience can be catastrophic. Words that are not said cannot be quoted. The mayor is the official spokesperson and representative of the city's position. The mayor is the designated representative of the council to present and speak on the official city position. If an individual public official is contacted by the media, the public official should be clear about whether their comments represent the official city position or a personal viewpoint. The public official should choose words carefully and cautiously. Comments taken out of context can cause problems. Be especially cautious about humor, sardonic asides, sarcasm, or word play. It is never appropriate to use personal slurs or swear words when talking with the media. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(j[2]), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-381. - Sanctions. 
(a)  Public disruption. Members of the public who do not follow proper conduct after a warning in a public hearing shall be barred from further testimony at that meeting or removed from the Council chambers. 
(b)  Inappropriate staff behavior. Public officials should refer to the city manager any city staff who do not follow proper conduct in their dealings with council members, board members, other city staff, or the public. These employees may be disciplined in accordance with standard city procedures for such actions. 
(c)  Public officials' behavior and conduct. Public officials who intentionally and repeatedly do not follow proper conduct may be reprimanded or formally censured by the council. Serious infractions of the code of ethics or code of conduct could lead to other sanctions as deemed appropriate by the council and as provided under law. Failure of an appointed public official to comply with the city's, county's and state's ethics codes shall result in removal of the public official. 
(d)  Appointed public officials. Violation of this article by an appointed public official, for a first offense, shall result in sanctions which sanctions may include removal of the appointed public official from the board or committee. A second violation of this code by an appointed public official shall result in removal of that appointed public official from the board or committee. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(k), 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-382. - Fair and equal treatment. 
(a)  Impartiality. No official or employee shall request, use or permit the use of any consideration, treatment, advantage or favor beyond that which it is the general practice to grant or make available to the public at large. 
(b)  Use of public property. No official or employee shall use his position to request, use or permit the use of any city-owned or city-supported property, vehicle, equipment, material, labor or service for the personal convenience or the private advantage of himself or of any other person. This rule shall not be deemed to prohibit an official or employee from requesting, using or permitting the use of such publicly-owned or publicly-supplied property, vehicle, equipment, material, labor or service which it is the general practice to make available to the public at large or which are provided as a matter of stated public policy for the use of officials and employees in the conduct of official business. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1, 3-11-2009) 
Sec. 2-383. - Improper influence of advisory board members by mayor and council members. 
    The mayor and council members of the city are hereby prohibited from directly or indirectly influencing, or attempting to influence, the decision and/or official act of any member of any advisory board of the city which would bring pecuniary and/or other direct personal benefit to the influencing council member.

ARTICLE VIII. - INVESTMENT POLICY[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-15 , § 2(Exh. A), adopted April 7, 2015, amended article VIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article VIII, §§ 2-401-2-418, pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 2-401. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this policy is to set forth the investment objectives and parameters for the management of public funds of the City of Doral, Florida (hereinafter "city"). These policies are designed to ensure the prudent management of public funds, the availability of operating and capital funds when needed, and an investment return competitive with comparable funds and financial market indices. 
(Ord. No. 2015-15 , § 2(Exh. A, § I), 4-7-2015; Ord. No. 2016-07 , § 2(Exh. A, § I), 4-13-2016; Ord. No. 2018-06 , § 2(Exh. A, § I), 5-9-2018) 
Sec. 2-402. - Scope. 
    In accordance with F.S. § 218.415, this investment policy ("policy") applies to all cash and investments held or controlled by the city with the exception of pension funds and funds related to the issuance of debt where there are other existing policies or indentures in effect for such funds. Funds held by state agencies (e.g., Department of Revenue) are not subject to the provisions of this policy. 
    Pooling of funds. Except for cash in certain restricted and special funds, the city may consolidate cash and reserve balances from all funds to maximize investment earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, safekeeping and administration. Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
(Ord. No. 2015-15 , § 2(Exh. A, § II), 4-7-2015; Ord. No. 2016-07 , § 2(Exh. A, § II), 4-13-2016; Ord. No. 2018-06 , § 2(Exh. A, § II), 5-9-2018) 
Sec. 2-403. - Investment objectives. 
    Safety of principal and maintenance of liquidity. The objectives of this investment program are the safety of the principal and the maintenance of liquidity of those funds within the portfolios. Investment transactions shall seek to keep capital losses at a minimum, whether they are from securities defaults or erosion of market value. To attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. The portfolios shall be managed in such a manner that funds are available to meet reasonably anticipated cash flow requirements in an orderly manner. Periodic cash flow analyses will be completed in order to ensure that the portfolios are positioned to provide sufficient liquidity. If a security is downgraded below the minimum allowed by the investment policy, the investment manager must notify the city with a recommendation. The portfolio may hold up to five percent in these securities. 
    Return on investment. Investment portfolios shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of least importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. However, return is attempted through active management where the investment manager or advisor utilizes a total return strategy (which includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses in the portfolio). This total return strategy seeks to increase the value of the portfolio through reinvestment of income and capital gains. The core of investments is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Despite this, an investment manager or advisor may trade to recognize a loss from time to time to achieve a perceived relative value based on its potential to enhance the total return of the portfolio. 
    Public trust. All participants in the investment process shall act as custodians of the public trust. Investment officials shall recognize that the investment portfolio is subject to public review and evaluation. The overall program shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. 
(Ord. No. 2015-15 , § 2(Exh. A, § III), 4-7-2015; Ord. No. 2016-07 , § 2(Exh. A, § III), 4-13-2016; Ord. No. 2018-06 , § 2(Exh. A, § III), 5-9-2018) 
Sec. 2-404. - Delegation of authority. 
    In accordance with the Charter of the City of Doral, the responsibility for providing oversight and direction in regard to the management of the investment program resides with the city manager. The daily management responsibility for all city funds in the investment program and investment transactions is delegated to the finance director. The finance director shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment portfolio and a system of internal accounting and administrative controls to regulate the activities of employees. The city may employ an investment manager or advisor to assist in managing some or all of the city's portfolios. Such investment manager or advisor must be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The city will contract with investment managers or advisors for not more than five years per contract, and will seek competitive proposals from investment management/advisory firms for either renewal or replacement of the contracted firm to commence at the beginning of the sixth year.

GLOSSARY 
    The following is a glossary of key investing terms, many of which appear in the City of Doral's investment policy. This glossary clarifies the meaning of investment terms generally used in cash and investment management. This glossary has been adapted from the GFOA Sample Investment Policy and the Association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada's Model Investment Policy. 
    Accrued Interest. Interest earned but which has not yet been paid or received. 
    Agency. See "Federal Agency Securities." 
    Ask Price. Price at which a broker/dealer offers to sell a security to an investor. Also known as "offered price." 
    Asset Backed Securities (ABS). A fixed-income security backed by notes or receivables against assets other than real estate. Generally issued by special purpose companies that "own" the assets and issue the ABS. Examples include securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, home equity loans, manufactured housing loans, farm equipment loans, and aircraft leases. 
    Average Life. The average length of time that an issue of serial bonds and/or term bonds with a mandatory sinking fund feature is expected to be outstanding. 
    Bankers' Acceptance (BA's). A draft or bill of exchange drawn upon and accepted by a bank. Frequently used to finance shipping of international goods. Used as a short-term credit instrument, bankers' acceptances are traded at a discount from face value as a money market instrument in the secondary market on the basis of the credit quality of the guaranteeing bank. 
    Basis Point. One hundredth of one percent, or 0.01%. Thus 1% equals 100 basis points. 
    Bearer Security. A security whose ownership is determined by the holder of the physical security. Typically, there is no registration on the issuer's books. Title to bearer securities is transferred by delivery of the physical security or certificate. Also known as "physical securities." 
    Benchmark Bills. In November 1999, FNMA introduced its Benchmark Bills program, a short-term debt securities issuance program to supplement its existing discount note program. The program includes a schedule of larger, weekly issues in three- and six-month maturities and biweekly issues in one-year for Benchmark Bills. Each issue is brought to market via a Dutch (single price) auction. FNMA conducts a weekly auction for each Benchmark Bill maturity and accepts both competitive and non-competitive bids through a web based auction system. This program is in addition to the variety of other discount note maturities, with rates posted on a daily basis, which FNMA offers. FNMA's Benchmark Bills are unsecured general obligations that are issued in book-entry form through the Federal Reserve Banks. There are no periodic payments of interest on Benchmark Bills, which are sold at a discount from the principal amount and payable at par at maturity. Issues under the Benchmark program constitute the same credit standing as other FNMA discount notes; they simply add organization and liquidity to the short-term Agency discount note market. 
    Benchmark Notes/Bonds. Benchmark Notes and Bonds are a series of FNMA "bullet" maturities (non-callable) issued according to a pre-announced calendar. Under its Benchmark Notes/Bonds program, two, three, five, ten, and 30-year maturities are issued each quarter. Each Benchmark Notes new issue has a minimum size of $4 billion, 30-year new issues having a minimum size of $1 billion, with re-openings based on investor demand to further enhance liquidity. The amount of non-callable issuance has allowed FNMA to build a yield curve in Benchmark Notes and Bonds in maturities ranging from two to 30 years. The liquidity emanating from these large size issues has facilitated favorable financing opportunities through the development of a liquid overnight and term repo market. Issues under the Benchmark program constitute the same credit standing as other FNMA issues; they simply add organization and liquidity to the intermediate- and long-term Agency market. 
    Benchmark. A market index used as a comparative basis for measuring the performance of an investment portfolio. A performance benchmark should represent a close correlation to investment guidelines, risk tolerance, and duration of the actual portfolio's investments. 
    Bid Price. Price at which a broker/dealer offers to purchase a security from an investor. 
    Bond. Financial obligation for which the issuer promises to pay the bondholder (the purchaser or owner of the bond) a specified stream of future cash-flows, including periodic interest payments and a principal repayment. 
    Book Entry Securities. Securities that are recorded in a customer's account electronically through one of the financial markets electronic delivery and custody systems, such as the Fed Securities wire, DTC, and PTC (as opposed to bearer or physical securities). The trend is toward a certificate-free society in order to cut down on paperwork and to diminish investors' concerns about the certificates themselves. The vast majority of securities are now book entry securities. 
    Book Value. The value at which a debt security is reflected on the holder's records at any point in time. Book value is also called "amortized cost" as it represents the original cost of an investment adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount. Also called "carrying value." Book value can vary over time as an investment approaches maturity and differs from "market value" in that it is not affected by changes in market interest rates. 
    Broker/Dealer. A person or firm transacting securities business with customers. A "broker" acts as an agent between buyers and sellers, and receives a commission for these services. A "dealer" buys and sells financial assets from its own portfolio. A dealer takes risk by owning inventory of securities, whereas a broker merely matches up buyers and sellers. See also "Primary Dealer." 
    Bullet Notes/Bonds. Notes or bonds that have a single maturity date and are non-callable. 
    Call Date. Date at which a call option may be or is exercised. 
    Call Option. The right, but not the obligation, of an issuer of a security to redeem a security at a specified value and at a specified date or dates prior to its stated maturity date. Most fixed-income calls are a par, but can be at any previously established price. Securities issued with a call provision typically carry a higher yield than similar securities issued without a call feature. There are three primary types of call options (1) European - one-time calls, (2) Bermudan - periodically on a predetermined schedule (quarterly, semi-annual, annual), and (3) American - continuously callable at any time on or after the call date. There is usually a notice period of at least five business days prior to a call date. 
    Callable Bonds/Notes. Securities which contain an imbedded call option giving the issuer the right to redeem the securities prior to maturity at a predetermined price and time. 
    Certificate of Deposit (CD). Bank obligation issued by a financial institution generally offering a fixed rate of return (coupon) for a specified period of time (maturity). Can be as long as ten years to maturity, but most CDs purchased by public agencies are one year and under. 
    Collateral. Investment securities or other property that a borrower pledges to secure repayment of a loan, secure deposits of public monies, or provide security for a repurchase agreement. 
    Collateralization. Process by which a borrower pledges securities, property, or other deposits for securing the repayment of a loan and/or security. 
    Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO). A security that pools together mortgages and separates them into short, medium, and long-term positions (called tranches). Tranches are set up to pay different rates of interest depending upon their maturity. Interest payments are usually paid monthly. In "plain vanilla" CMOs, principal is not paid on a tranche until all shorter tranches have been paid off. This system provides interest and principal in a more predictable manner. A single pool of mortgages can be carved up into numerous tranches each with its own payment and risk characteristics. 
    Commercial Paper. Short term unsecured promissory note issued by a company or financial institution. Issued at a discount and matures for par or face value. Usually a maximum maturity of 270 days and given a short-term debt rating by one or more NRSROs. 
    Convexity. A measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changing interest rates. A high convexity indicates greater sensitivity of a bond's price to interest rate changes. 
    Corporate Note. A debt instrument issued by a corporation with a maturity of greater than one year and less than ten years. 
    Counterparty. The other party in a two party financial transaction. "Counterparty risk" refers to the risk that the other party to a transaction will fail in its related obligations. For example, the bank or broker/dealer in a repurchase agreement. 
    Coupon Rate. Annual rate of interest on a debt security, expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value. 
    Current Yield. Annual rate of return on a bond based on its price. Calculated as (coupon rate / price), but does not accurately reflect a bond's true yield level. 
    Custody. Safekeeping services offered by a bank, financial institution, or trust company, referred to as the "custodian." Service normally includes the holding and reporting of the customer's securities, the collection and disbursement of income, securities settlement, and market values. 
    Dealer. A dealer, as opposed to a broker, acts as a principal in all transactions, buying and selling for his/her own account. 
    Delivery Versus Payment (DVP). Settlement procedure in which securities are delivered versus payment of cash, but only after cash has been received. Most security transactions, including those through the Fed Securities Wire system and DTC, are done DVP as a protection for both the buyer and seller of securities. 
    Depository Trust Company (DTC). A firm through which members can use a computer to arrange for securities to be delivered to other members without physical delivery of certificates. A member of the Federal Reserve System and owned mostly by the New York Stock Exchange, the Depository Trust Company uses computerized debit and credit entries. Most corporate securities, commercial paper, CDs, and BAs clear through DTC. 
    Derivatives. (1) Financial instruments whose return profile is linked to, or derived from, the movement of one or more underlying index or security, and may include a leveraging factor, or (2) financial contracts based upon notional amounts whose value is derived from an underlying index or security (interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equities, or commodities). For hedging purposes, common derivatives are options, futures, interest rate swaps, and swaptions. All Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) are derivatives. 
    Derivative Security. Financial instrument created from, or whose value depends upon, one or more underlying assets or indexes of asset values. 
    Designated Bond. FFCB's regularly issued, liquid, non-callable securities that generally have a two or three year original maturity. New issues of Designated Bonds are $1 billion or larger. Re-openings of existing Designated Bond issues are generally a minimum of $100 million. Designated Bonds are offered through a syndicate of two to six dealers. Twice each month the Funding Corporation announces its intention to issue a new Designated Bond, reopen an existing issue, or to not issue or reopen a Designated Bond. Issues under the Designated Bond program constitute the same credit standing as other FFCB issues; they simply add organization and liquidity to the intermediate- and long-term Agency market. 
    Discount Notes. Unsecured general obligations issued by Federal Agencies at a discount. Discount notes mature at par and can range in maturity from overnight to one year. Very large primary (new issue) and secondary markets exist. 
    Discount Rate. Rate charged by the system of Federal Reserve Banks on overnight loans to member banks. Changes to this rate are administered by the Federal Reserve and closely mirror changes to the "fed funds rate." 
    Discount Securities. Non-interest bearing money market instruments that are issued at discount and redeemed at maturity for full face value. Examples include: U.S. Treasury Bills, Federal Agency Discount Notes, Bankers' Acceptances, and Commercial Paper. 
    Discount. The amount by which a bond or other financial instrument sells below its face value. See also "Premium." 
    Diversification. Dividing investment funds among a variety of security types, maturities, industries, and issuers offering potentially independent returns. 
    Dollar Price. A bond's cost expressed as a percentage of its face value. For example, a bond quoted at a dollar price of 951/2, would have a principal cost of $955.00 per $1,000.00 of face value. 
    Duff & Phelps. One of several NRSROs that provide credit ratings on corporate and bank debt issues. 
    Duration. The weighted average maturity of a security's or portfolio's cash-flows, where the present values of the cash-flows serve as the weights. The greater the duration of a security/portfolio, the greater its percentage price volatility with respect to changes in interest rates. Used as a measure of risk and a key tool for managing a portfolio versus a benchmark and for hedging risk. There are also different kinds of duration used for different purposes (e.g. MacAuley Duration, Modified Duration). 
    Fannie Mae. See "Federal National Mortgage Association." 
    Fed Money Wire. A computerized communications system that connects the Federal Reserve System with its member banks, certain U. S. Treasury offices, and the Washington D.C. office of the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Fed Money Wire is the book entry system used to transfer cash balances between banks for themselves and for customer accounts.

    Federal Agency. Government sponsored/owned entity created by the U.S. Congress, generally for the purpose of acting as a financial intermediary by borrowing in the marketplace and directing proceeds to specific areas of the economy considered to otherwise have restricted access to credit markets. The largest Federal Agencies are GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, FHLB, FFCB, SLMA, and TVA. 
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Federal agency that insures deposits at commercial banks, currently to a limit of $250,000.00 per depositor per bank. 
    Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB). One of the large Federal Agencies. A government sponsored enterprise (GSE) system that is a network of cooperatively-owned lending institutions that provides credit services to farmers, agricultural cooperatives and rural utilities. The FFCBs act as financial intermediaries that borrow money in the capital markets and use the proceeds to make loans and provide other assistance to farmers and farm-affiliated businesses. Consists of the consolidated operations of the Banks for Cooperatives, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and Federal Land Banks. Frequent issuer of discount notes, agency notes and callable agency securities. FFCB debt is not an obligation of, nor is it guaranteed by the U.S. government, although it is considered to have minimal credit risk due to its importance to the U.S. financial system and agricultural industry. Also issues notes under its "designated note" program. 
    Federal Funds (Fed Funds). Funds placed in Federal Reserve Banks by depository institutions in excess of current reserve requirements, and frequently loaned or borrowed on an overnight basis between depository institutions.

A government sponsored enterprise (GSE) system, consisting of wholesale banks (currently twelve district banks) owned by their member banks, which provides correspondent banking services and credit to various financial institutions, financed by the issuance of securities. The principal purpose of the FHLB is to add liquidity to the mortgage markets. Although FHLB does not directly fund mortgages, it provides a stable supply of credit to thrift institutions that make new mortgage loans. FHLB debt is not an obligation of, nor is it guaranteed by the U.S. government, although it is considered to have minimal credit risk due to its importance to the U.S. financial system and housing market.

The Federal Reserve System is made up of twelve Federal Reserve District Banks, their branches, and many national and state banks throughout the nation. It is headed by the seven member Board of Governors known as the "Federal Reserve Board" and headed by its Chairman. 
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). A private corporation that acts as a self-regulatory organization (SRO). FINRA is the successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).

    Freddie Mac. See "Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation." 
    Ginnie Mae. See "Government National Mortgage Association." 
    Global Notes. Notes designed to qualify for immediate trading in both the domestic U.S. capital market and in foreign markets around the globe. Usually large issues that are sold to investors worldwide and therefore have excellent liquidity. Despite their global sales, global notes sold in the U.S. are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. 
    Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or "Ginnie Mae"). One of the large Federal Agencies. Government-owned Federal Agency that acquires, packages, and resells mortgages and mortgage purchase commitments in the form of mortgage-backed securities.

    Government Securities. An obligation of the U.S. government, backed by the full faith and credit of the government. These securities are regarded as the highest quality of investment securities available in the U.S. securities market. See "Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds, and SLGS." 
    Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE). Privately owned entity subject to federal regulation and supervision, created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy such as students, farmers, and homeowners. GSEs carry the implicit backing of the U.S. government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. government. For this reason, these securities will offer a yield premium over U.S. Treasuries. Examples of GSEs include: FHLB, FHLMC, FNMA, and SLMA. 
    Government Sponsored Enterprise Security. A security issued by a Government Sponsored Enterprise. Considered Federal Agency Securities. 
    Index. A compilation of statistical data that tracks changes in the economy or in financial markets. 
    Interest-Only (IO) STRIP. A security based solely on the interest payments from the bond. After the principal has been repaid, interest payments stop and the value of the security falls to nothing. Therefore, IOs are considered risky investments. Usually associated with mortgage-backed securities. 
    Internal Controls. An internal control structure ensures that the assets of the entity are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that 1) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and 2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. Internal controls should address the following points: 
(1)  Control of collusion - Collusion is a situation where two or more employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer. 
(2)  Separation of transaction authority from accounting and record keeping - A separation of duties is achieved by separating the person who authorizes or performs the transaction from the people who record or otherwise account for the transaction. 
(3)  Custodial safekeeping - Securities purchased from any bank or dealer including appropriate collateral (as defined by state law) shall be placed with an independent third party for custodial safekeeping. 
(4)  Avoidance of physical delivery securities - Book-entry securities are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery of a document never takes place. Delivered securities must be properly safeguarded against loss or destruction. The potential for fraud and loss increases with physically delivered securities. 
(5)  Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members - Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority and responsibilities to avoid improper actions. Clear delegation of authority also preserves the internal control structure that is contingent on the various staff positions and their respective responsibilities. 
(6)  Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers - Due to the potential for error and improprieties arising from telephone and electronic transactions, all transactions should be supported by written communications and approved by the appropriate person. Written communications may be via fax if on letterhead and if the safekeeping institution has a list of authorized signatures. 
(7)  Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and third-party custodian - The designated official should ensure that an agreement will be entered into and will address the following points: controls, security provisions, and responsibilities of each party making and receiving wire transfers. 
    Inverse Floater. A floating rate security structured in such a way that it reacts inversely to the direction of interest rates. Considered risky as their value moves in the opposite direction of normal fixed-income investments and whose interest rate can fall to zero. 
    Investment Manager. A company that provides professional advice for managing portfolios, investment research and recommendations in exchange for a management fee. May have non-discretionary authority (providing advice) or discretionary authority (managing the portfolio on the governmental entity's behalf). Also provides other services such as investment policy development and ongoing reviews, portfolio reporting, training, and presentations to staff, investment committees and perhaps elected officials. The term Investment Advisor is interchangeable with Investment Manager. 
    Investment Adviser Act of 1940. Federal legislation that sets the standards by which investment companies, such as mutual funds, are regulated in the areas of advertising, promotion, performance reporting requirements, and securities valuations. 
    Investment Grade. Bonds considered suitable for preservation of invested capital, including bonds rated a minimum of Baa3 by Moody's, BBB- by Standard & Poor's, or BBB- by Fitch. Although "BBB" rated bonds are considered investment grade, most public agencies cannot invest in securities rated below "A." 
    Liquidity. Relative ease of converting an asset into cash without significant loss of value. Also, a relative measure of cash and near-cash items in a portfolio of assets. Additionally, it is a term describing the marketability of a money market security correlating to the narrowness of the spread between the bid and ask prices. 
    Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP). An investment by local governments in which their money is pooled as a method for managing local funds, (e.g., Florida State Board of Administration's Florida Prime Fund). 
    Long-Term Core Investment Program. Funds that are not needed within a one-year period.

    Maturity Date. Date on which principal payment of a financial obligation is to be paid. 
    Medium Term Notes (MTN's). Used frequently to refer to corporate notes of medium maturity (five-years and under). Technically, any debt security issued by a corporate or depository institution with a maturity from one to ten years and issued under an MTN shelf registration. Usually issued in smaller issues with varying coupons and maturities, and underwritten by a variety of broker/dealers (as opposed to large corporate deals issued and underwritten all at once in large size and with a fixed coupon and maturity). 
    Money Market. The market in which short-term debt instruments (bills, commercial paper, bankers' acceptance, etc.) are issued and traded. 
    Money Market Mutual Fund (MMF). A type of mutual fund that invests solely in money market instruments, such as: U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, and repurchase agreements. Money market mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are subject to "rule 2a-7" which significantly limits average maturity and credit quality of holdings. MMF's are managed to maintain a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1.00. Many MMFs carry ratings by a NRSRO. 
    Moody's Investors Service. One of several NRSROs that provide credit ratings on corporate and municipal debt issues. 
    Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). Mortgage-backed securities represent an ownership interest in a pool of mortgage loans made by financial institutions, such as savings and loans, commercial banks, or mortgage companies, to finance the borrower's purchase of a home or other real estate. The majority of MBS are issued and/or guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC. There are a variety of MBS structures with varying levels of risk and complexity. All MBS have reinvestment risk as actual principal and interest payments are dependent on the payment of the underlying mortgages which can be prepaid by mortgage holders to refinance and lower rates or simply because the underlying property was sold. 
    Mortgage Pass-Through Securities. A pool of residential mortgage loans with the monthly interest and principal distributed to investors on a pro-rata basis. The largest issuer is GNMA. 
    Municipal Note/Bond. A debt instrument issued by a state or local government unit or public agency. The vast majority of municipals are exempt from state and federal income tax, although some non-qualified issues are taxable. 
    Mutual Fund. Portfolio of securities professionally managed by a registered investment company that issues shares to investors. Many different types of mutual funds exist (e.g., bond, equity, and money market funds); all except money market funds operate on a variable net asset value (NAV). 
    Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (Negotiable CD). Large denomination CDs ($100,000.00 and larger) that are issued in bearer form and can be traded in the secondary market. 
    Net Asset Value. The market value of one share of an investment company, such as a mutual fund. This figure is calculated by totaling a fund's assets including securities, cash, and any accrued earnings, then subtracting the total assets from the fund's liabilities, and dividing this total by the number of shares outstanding. This is calculated once a day based on the closing price for each security in the fund's portfolio. (See below.) 
[(Total assets) - (Liabilities)]/ (Number of shares outstanding) 
    NRSRO. A "Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization" (NRSRO) is a designated rating organization that the SEC has deemed a strong national presence in the U.S. NRSROs provide credit ratings on corporate and bank debt issues.

    Physical Delivery. Delivery of readily available underlying assets at contract maturity. 
    Portfolio. Collection of securities and investments held by an investor. 
    Premium. The amount by which a bond or other financial instrument sells above its face value. See also "Discount." 
    Primary Dealer. A designation given to certain government securities dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Primary dealers can buy and sell government securities directly with the Fed. Primary dealers also submit daily reports of market activity and security positions held to the Fed and are subject to its informal oversight. Primary dealers are the largest buyers and sellers by volume in the U.S. Treasury securities market. 
    Prime Paper. Commercial paper of high quality. Highest rated paper is A-11 by S&P and P-1 by Moody's. 
    Principal. Face value of a financial instrument on which interest accrues. May be less than par value if some principal has been repaid or retired. For a transaction, principal is par value times price and includes any premium or discount. 
    Prudent Expert Rule. Standard that requires that a fiduciary manage a portfolio with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, under the circumstances then prevailing, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. This statement differs from the "prudent person" rule in that familiarity with such matters suggests a higher standard than simple prudence. 
    Prudent Investor Standard. Standard that requires that when investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiarity with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the agency. More stringent than the "prudent person" standard as it implies a level of knowledge commensurate with the responsibility at hand. 
    Qualified Public Depository. Per F.S. Subsection 280.02(26), "qualified public depository" means any bank, savings bank, or savings association that: 
(1)  Is organized and exists under the laws of the United States, the laws of this state or any other state or territory of the United States.

(6)  Has been designated by the Chief Financial Officer as a qualified public depository. 
    Range Note. A type of structured note that accrues interest daily at a set coupon rate that is tied to an index. Most range notes have two coupon levels; a higher accrual rate for the period the index is within a designated range, the lower accrual rate for the period that the index falls outside the designated range. This lower rate may be zero and may result in zero earnings. 
    Rate of Return. Amount of income received from an investment, expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. 
    Realized Gains (Losses). The difference between the sale price of an investment and its book value. Gains/losses are "realized" when the security is actually sold, as compared to "unrealized" gains/losses which are based on current market value. See "Unrealized Gains (Losses)." 
    Reference Bills. FHLMC's short-term debt program created to supplement its existing discount note program by offering issues from one month through one year, auctioned on a weekly or on an alternating four-week basis (depending upon maturity) offered in sizeable volumes ($1 billion and up) on a cycle of regular, standardized issuance. Globally sponsored and distributed, Reference Bill issues are intended to encourage active trading and market-making and facilitate the development of a term repo market. The program was designed to offer predictable supply, pricing transparency, and liquidity, thereby providing alternatives to U.S. Treasury bills. FHLMC's Reference Bills are unsecured general corporate obligations. This program supplements the corporation's existing discount note program. Issues under the Reference program constitute the same credit standing as other FHLMC discount notes; they simply add organization and liquidity to the short-term Agency discount note market. 
    Reference Notes. FHLMC's intermediate-term debt program with issuances of two, three, five, ten, and 30-year maturities. Initial issuances range from $2-$6 billion with re-openings ranging $1-$4 billion. 
The notes are high-quality bullet structures securities that pay interest semiannually. Issues under the reference program constitute the same credit standing as other FHLMC notes; they simply add organization and liquidity to the intermediate- and long-term agency market. 
    Repurchase Agreement (Repo). A short-term investment vehicle where an investor agrees to buy securities from a counterparty and simultaneously agrees to resell the securities back to the counterparty at an agreed upon time and for an agreed upon price. The difference between the purchase price and the sale price represents interest earned on the agreement. In effect, it represents a collateralized loan to the investor, where the securities are the collateral. Can be DVP, where securities are delivered to the investor's custodial bank, or "tri-party" where the securities are delivered to a third party intermediary. Any type of security can be used as "collateral," but only some types provide the investor with special bankruptcy protection under the law. Repos should be undertaken only when an appropriate Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) approved master repurchase agreement is in place. 
    Reverse Repurchase Agreement (Reverse Repo). A repo from the point of view of the original seller of securities. Used by dealers to finance their inventory of securities by essentially borrowing at short-term rates.

    Secondary Market. Markets for the purchase and sale of any previously issued financial instrument.

    Securities Lending. An arrangement between an investor and a custody bank that allows the custody bank to "loan" the investors investment holdings, reinvest the proceeds in permitted investments, and shares any profits with the investor. Should be governed by a securities lending agreement. Can increase the risk of a portfolio in that the investor takes on the default risk on the reinvestment at the discretion of the custodian. 
    Sinking Fund. A separate accumulation of cash or investments (including earnings on investments) in a fund in accordance with the terms of a trust agreement or indenture, funded by periodic deposits by the issuer (or other entity responsible for debt service), for the purpose of assuring timely availability of moneys for payment of debt service. Usually used in connection with term bonds.

    Standard & Poor's. One of several NRSROs that provide credit ratings on corporate and municipal debt issues. 
    STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). Acronym applied to U.S. Treasury securities that have had their coupons and principal repayments separated into individual zero-coupon Treasury securities. The same technique and "strips" description can be applied to non-Treasury securities (e.g., FNMA strips). 
    Structured Notes. Notes that have imbedded into their structure options such as step-up coupons or derivative-based returns. 
    Supranationals. U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations of a multilateral organization of governments where U.S. is a shareholder and voting member. 
    Swap. Trading one asset for another. 
    TAP Notes. Federal Agency notes issued under the FHLB TAP program. Launched in 6/99 as a refinement to the FHLB bullet bond auction process. In a break from the FHLB's traditional practice of bringing numerous small issues to market with similar maturities, the TAP Issue Program uses the four most common maturities and reopens them up regularly through a competitive auction. These maturities (two, three, five, and ten year) will remain open for the calendar quarter, after which they will be closed and a new series of TAP issues will be opened to replace them. This reduces the number of separate bullet bonds issued, but generates enhanced awareness and liquidity in the marketplace through increased issue size and secondary market volume. 
    Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). One of the large Federal Agencies. A wholly owned corporation of the United States government that was established in 1933 to develop the resources of the Tennessee Valley region in order to strengthen the regional and national economy and the national defense. Power operations are separated from non-power operations. TVA securities represent obligations of TVA, payable solely from TVA's net power proceeds, and are neither obligations of nor guaranteed by the United States.

    Treasury Bills (T-Bills). Short-term direct obligations of the United States government issued with an original term of one year or less. Treasury bills are sold at a discount from face value and do not pay interest before maturity. The difference between the purchase price of the bill and the maturity value is the interest earned on the bill. Currently, the U.S. Treasury issues four-week, 13-week, and 26-week T-Bills. 
    Treasury Bonds. Long-term interest-bearing debt securities backed by the U.S. government and issued with maturities of ten years and longer by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

    Unrealized Gains (Losses). The difference between the market value of an investment and its book value. Gains/losses are "realized" when the security is actually sold, as compared to "unrealized" gains/losses which are based on current market value. See also "Realized Gains (Losses)." 
    Variable-Rate Security. A bond that bears interest at a rate that varies over time based on a specified schedule of adjustment (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually). See also "Floating Rate Note." 
    Weighted Average Maturity (or just "Average Maturity"). The average maturity of all securities and investments of a portfolio, determined by multiplying the par or principal value of each security or investment by its maturity (days or years), summing the products, and dividing the sum by the total principal value of the portfolio. A simple measure of risk of a fixed-income portfolio. 
    Weighted Average Maturity to Call. The average maturity of all securities and investments of a portfolio, adjusted to substitute the first call date per security for maturity date for those securities with call provisions. 
    Yield Curve. A graphic depiction of yields on like securities in relation to remaining maturities spread over a time line. The traditional yield curve depicts yields on U.S. Treasuries, although yield curves exist for Federal Agencies and various credit quality corporates as well. Yield curves can be positively sloped (normal) where longer-term investments have higher yields, or "inverted" (uncommon) where longer-term investments have lower yields than shorter ones. 
    Yield to Call (YTC). Same as "Yield to Maturity," except the return is measured to the first call date rather than the maturity date. Yield to call can be significantly higher or lower than a security's yield to maturity. 
    Yield to Maturity (YTM). Calculated return on an investment, assuming all cash-flows from the security are reinvested at the same original yield. Can be higher or lower than the coupon rate depending on market rates and whether the security was purchased at a premium or discount. There are different conventions for calculating YTM for various types of securities. 
    Yield. There are numerous methods of yield determination. In this glossary, see also "Current Yield," "Yield Curve," "Yield to Call," and "Yield to Maturity."

State Law reference- Enforcement procedure, F.S. § 162.06. 

Sec. 11-47. - Established. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances. No special magistrate shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of a city or county ordinance or code is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify a special magistrate and request a hearing. A hearing shall be scheduled and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in this section to the violator. At the option of the special magistrate, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in this section. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to a special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the scheduled hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify a special magistrate and request a hearing. The special magistrate, through the city clerk's office, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to this section. The case may be presented to the special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the scheduled hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the special magistrate retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his rights to this hearing and pay the costs as determined by the special magistrate. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the special magistrate and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before a special magistrate or a court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the special magistrate hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and the materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File notice in writing with the code enforcement official disclosing the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(f)  In addition to notifying the violator as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the code inspector, clerical staff or other persons designated by the city manager may also provide notice by mail or other means to the mortgage holders, other persons or entities having an interest in the subject property.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.06. 
Sec. 11-48. - Conduct of hearings. 
(a)  Upon request of the code inspector or at such other times as may be necessary, the special magistrate may call hearings. The special magistrate at any hearing may set a future hearing date. The special magistrate shall attempt to convene no less frequently than once every month but may meet more or less often as the demand necessitates. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings, and all hearings shall be open to the public. The city clerk's office shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of the special magistrate duties. If the city council prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the special magistrate, including, but not limited to, costs for enforcement, inspections, preparation of enforcement reports, photographs, testing, monitoring, title search, postage, service of notice and/or orders, translator, audio/video of proceeding, recording demonstrable administrative and/or clerical costs, attributable special magistrate fees, and hearing facility costs. Such costs may be included in the lien authorized under F.S. § 162.09(3). 
(b)  Except as provided in article II of this chapter, the special magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day and shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern said proceedings. 
(c)  The code compliance division chief or the city attorney shall represent the city by presenting cases before the special magistrate. 
(d)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall issue findings of fact based on evidence and conclusions of law and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date, and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by that date, and, under the conditions specified in this section, the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by the specified date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, upon any subsequent purchases, successors in interests, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this section and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.07. 
Sec. 11-49. - Fine. 
(a)  A special magistrate, upon notification by the code inspector that an order previously issued in a case has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found by the code inspector to have occurred. 
(b)  In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 11-47(d), the special magistrate shall notify the city manager, which may make all reasonable repairs required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city council to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city council for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this article, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If after due notice and hearing a special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  In addition to such fines, a special magistrate may impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the city council in enforcing its or the county's codes and all costs of repairs pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(d)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. In addition, the special magistrate may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. However, if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(e)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(f)  A special magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(g)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property; but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes.

23-101.3 Intent. The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22; 
(9)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities; and 
(10)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
23-101.4 Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code.

Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this article.

(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
23-107.7 Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the city council that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Sec. 26-21. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

(4)  For the fourth violation, a fine of $1,000.00.

Failure to pay such costs and penalties, or to appeal pursuant to section 32-107 within 15 days of receipt of the notice of violation shall result in the imposition of a lien upon the premises, in the amount of such costs and penalties. Such liens shall be treated as special assessment liens against the subject real property and, until fully paid and discharged, shall remain liens equal in rank and dignity with the lien of ad valorem taxes, and shall be superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in, to or against the real property involved. Such liens shall be enforced by any of the methods provided in F.S. ch. 86; or, in the alternative, foreclosure proceedings may be instituted and prosecuted under the provisions of F.S. ch. 173; or the collection and enforcement or payment thereof may be accomplished by any other method authorized by law. The recycling customer of the premises shall pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the collection of fines, and other charges, penalties, and liens imposed by virtue of this chapter. 
(c)  For violations which (i) present a serious threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, and/or (ii) constitute a fourth or subsequent offense by the same violator, the city may seek injunctive relief, in addition to the penalties set forth herein, as applicable.

The procedures and application fee for the scheduling and conduct of the hearing shall be as provided in chapter 11 of the City Code. Failure to appeal within the prescribed time period shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation, and fines and penalties may be assessed accordingly. 
(b)  Timely filing of a notice of appeal pursuant to this section shall toll the imposition of a lien or enforcement procedures pursuant to section 32-106, until 30 days after the issuance of a written determination by the special master. Any costs or penalty amounts due the city pursuant to such determination must be received by the city within 30 days after the issuance of the determination, or a lien shall be imposed upon the premises, and any other enforcement or collection procedures may be commenced, as provided by this chapter or under state law.

Sec. 38-2. - Intent and purpose. 
    The city recognizes that the unregulated obstruction or closure of streets and sidewalks adversely impacts the residents, businesses and visitors of the city. Therefore, it is the intent of the city to ensure the efficient and safe flow of traffic, and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: requiring a Maintenance of Traffic (M.O.T.) permit, inspections and providing enforcement for all work being performed or conducted within the public right-of-way which impedes the general movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic within the city; establishing, adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage public right-of-way work and vehicular lane and pedestrian sidewalk closures; and minimizing the disruption to the public right-of-way.

Failure of any person(s) to fully disclose his/her/their interest/participation/representation in the permit application and/or to fulfill all city requirements for issuance of the permit shall result in: 
(1)  Immediate revocation by the city, without the necessity of any further action, hearing, or proceeding, of any permit previously granted resulting in such permit becoming null and void; or 
(2)  Issuance by the city of a written notice that such permit will not be granted, as the case may be, due to violation of this provision by the person(s) who applied for such permit.

Such permit shall set forth minimal reasonable conditions, as permitted by law, necessary for the protection of property and personal safety, the restoration of the public right-of-way to a condition satisfactory to the city, and any on-going maintenance or reparations for un-repaired conditions or damages that may be required of the person(s) under the circumstances and extent of the work to be performed or conducted by such person(s) under such permit. Any violation of the conditions set forth and/or any violations under applicable law shall render such permit null and void, without the necessity of any further action, hearing, or proceeding. Such permit shall cover the length of time necessary and reasonable according to the type of activity involved. Such permit shall also be present on the job site at all times while work is being performed or conducted within the public right-of-way which is impeding the general movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic within the city. 
(c)  Indemnity, hold harmless and insurance. It shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any such permit that the applicant shall assume all civil liability for applicant's acts of omission or commission from all claims, suits or actions of any kind whatsoever arising out of or resulting from the obstruction or closure, the issuance of the permit, or the operations or activities of the permittee and shall, further, hold the city, its officials, and employees harmless for any injuries, losses, or damages arising or resulting from the permitted work including any injuries, losses, or damages resulting from alleged negligent acts or omissions on the part of the city. The permittee shall be solely responsible for all activities and the installation and maintenance of traffic-control devices. The applicant shall ensure that adequate safety precautions are in effect at all times during the term of the permit. It shall be a further condition precedent to the issuance of any such permit for work to be performed in the public right-of-way that the permit holder(s) is/are jointly and severally responsible, at each permit holder's expense, for any damages regarding restoring the public right-of-way to its original condition before installation of facilities.

In addition, the applicant hereby agrees to provide additional insurance requirements, including but not limited to umbrella liability, or any additional requirements or endorsements as may be applicable, in connection with the scope of services contemplated by the permit. The certificate must reflect primary and noncontributory language and list the city as an additional insured. The certificate must also include coverage for all owned, hired, and non-owned vehicles with a combined single limit of $1,000,000.00, also listing the city as an additional insured, and must further afford coverage for worker's compensation as required by Florida statute. The insurance herein required shall remain in full force and effect during the entire term of the permit. Additionally, all such insurance for non-governmental applicant(s) shall be subject to annual review by the city's risk management department and the applicant shall be required to update as necessary to protect the city as set forth in this section. 
(2)  Government applicant(s). Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the governmental applicant(s) shall submit to the city a certificate of insurance or letter of self-insurance for each governmental applicant in accordance with and subject to the limitations as set forth in F.S. § 768.28.

(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-02), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-20. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, as it may be amended, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-01), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-21. - Registration for placing or maintaining. 
(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city as of said effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived has 60 days from the effective date to comply with the terms of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from: 
(1)  Obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. 
(2)  Complying with all applicable law, including city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city that shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration and of the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that the registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article; 
(4)  A copy of federal or state certification authorizing the applicant to provide communications services, if any; 
(5)  If the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the state, which may be satisfied by the number of the corporate certification or other means; and 
(6)  A security fund in accordance with this article. 
(d)  The city manager or his designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the city shall notify the applicant in writing of the noneffectiveness of registration, and reasons for the noneffectiveness. The city shall so notify an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city that the registrant will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in the public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration shall be nonexclusive. Registration shall not establish any right or priority to place or maintain a communications facility in any particular area in public rights-of-way within the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by October 1, of even-numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even-numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd-numbered year immediately preceding such even-numbered year shall be required to renew until the next even-numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, except, as of October 1, 2008, subsection (c)(3) of this section, a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations and this article, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(i)  A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be required to pay compensation to the city as required by applicable law and ordinances of the city. A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, other than a registrant that provides local services as defined in F.S. § 203.012(3), within the city, shall pay to the city the fees required to be paid by providers of toll service within the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-03), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-22. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  The registrant agrees at all times to comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state statutes and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" means a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. A registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency. The registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits or may impose lesser requirements. 
(c)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide a proposal for construction of the communications facility that sets forth at least the following: 
(1)  An engineering plan signed and sealed by a state-registered professional engineer, or prepared by a person who is exempt from such registration requirements as provided in F.S. § 471.003, identifying the location of the proposed facility, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and equipment that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e., anticipated construction methods and/or techniques); 
(3)  A traffic maintenance plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other persons with facilities in the public rights-of-way); 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information requested by the city that the city finds reasonably necessary to review the permit application. 
(d)  The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or to accommodate city plans for public improvements or projects that the city determines are in the public interest and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to interfere unreasonably with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and so as not to cause unreasonable interference with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The registrant shall endeavor to install all communications facilities underground. To the extent not inconsistent with Public Service Commission regulations, the city may require the use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit. In making such requests, the city shall take into consideration several factors, including inconvenience to the public and other users of rights-of-way and the economic and technical feasibility of such requests. The registrant shall be liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, irrigation system or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public rights-of-way. The appropriate city official may issue such rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way as may be consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(g)  A registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to at least its original condition before such work in public rights-of-way, subject to the city's satisfaction upon inspection. The registrant shall warrant its restoration for a period of 12 months after completion of such restoration. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 calendar days after completion of construction, or such other time as may be reasonably required by the city, the city may, after written notice to the registrant, perform such restoration using city employees, agents or contractors, and charge all costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended, and require reimbursement within 30 days after the submission of the bill by the city to the registrant. 
(h)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended. 
(i)  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended. 
(l)  A registrant shall place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in compliance with all applicable standards as established by all local, state or federal law and in conformance with the city ordinances, codes and regulations. The registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(m)  In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, upon request of the city, a registrant shall coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way. The city may require a registrant to alter reasonably its placement or maintenance schedule for permitted work as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. The city may provide a more definite timeframe based on specific city construction or maintenance schedules. 
(n)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability or availability of public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work or costs incurred by registrant or provision of services shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way and city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. In the event the city determines that a violation exists with respect to registrant's placement or maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way that is not considered to be an emergency or danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the city will provide the registrant no less than three days' written notice setting forth the violation and requesting correction. 
(q)  A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans or "as-builts" upon completion of any installation or construction. The plans shall be in a digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities based on the city's geographical database, or other format acceptable to the city. The registrant shall provide such plans at no cost to the city. The city shall maintain the confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided in accordance with F.S. § 202.195, as it may be amended. 
(r)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The registrant may allow city facilities to be co-located within city's public right-of-way through the use of a joint trench during the registrant's construction project. Such joint trench projects shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between the registrant and the city and may be subjected to other city right-of-way requirements. The city further reserves, without limitation, the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily support, protect, raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary support, protection, raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. Subject to applicable law, if the city requests the temporary support, protection, raising or lowering of a facility for a public purpose, the city shall not be charged for the temporary support, protection, raising or lowering of the facility.

Sec. 38-24. - Appeals. 
(a)  Final, written decisions of the city manager or his designee suspending or denying a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the special magistrate via the code compliance department within 30 days of the date of the final, written decision to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth in this section shall be waived. The special magistrate shall consider the appeal. The hearing shall occur within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, unless waived by the registrant, and a written decision shall be rendered within 20 days of the hearing. Upon correction of any grounds that gave rise to a suspension or denial, the suspension or denial shall be lifted. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall affect or limit the remedies the city has available under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-06), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-25. - Other utility or nonutility services in right-of-way require separate authorization. 
(a)  In the event the registrant desires to use its existing facilities or to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or nonutility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing any other services other than the provision of communications service, or for providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a registrant shall seek such additional and separate authorization from the city for such activities as may be required by applicable law. 
(b)  To the extent that any person or registrant leases or otherwise uses the facilities of a person that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place or maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way of the city, such person or registrant shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful exercise of the city's rights, including requiring the removal of such facilities from the public rights-of-way of the city, regardless of the effect on registrant's ability to place or maintain its own communications facilities in public rights-of-way of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-07), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-26. - Termination of registration. 
(a)  The involuntary termination of a previously effective registration may only be accomplished by an action of the special magistrate. The city manager or his designee may declare the registration terminated and revoke and cancel all privileges granted under that registration if: 
(1)  A federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communications services; 
(2)  The registrant's placement and maintenance in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way; or 
(3)  The registrant abandons all of its communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  Prior to such termination for any of the reasons set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the city manager or his designee shall notify the registrant in writing setting forth the matters pertinent to such reasons and describing the proposed action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant shall have 60 days after receipt of such notice within which to cure the violation, or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the special magistrate, to accomplish the same. 
(c)  In the event of an order by the special magistrate to terminate the registration, the registrant shall, within a reasonable time following such termination, provide an acceptable plan for transferring ownership of the communications facilities to another person in accordance with this article or shall remove or abandon the facilities and take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city safe. If the registrant has either abandoned its facilities or chooses to abandon its facilities, the city may either: 
(1)  Require the registrant or the registrant's bonding company to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its condition immediately prior to the removal; 
(2)  The city may require that some or all of the facilities be removed and the public rights-of-way restored to its such condition at the registrant's expense, using city employees, agents or contractors, and charge any and all costs to the registrant and require reimbursement; or 
(3)  Utilize or allow other persons to utilize the registrant's abandoned facilities. 
The obligations of the registrant hereunder shall survive the termination of a registrant. In the event of a declaration of termination of registration, this provision does not permit the city to cause the removal of any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, where required, and is properly registered with the city, for such certificated service, where required. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 2(101-08), 6-11-2008) 
Sec. 38-27. - Transfer or control, sale or assignment of assets. 
(a)  If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its registration or its facilities in the public rights-of-way, incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided to the city within 20 days of the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register.

(d)  The construction bond shall be issued by a surety, having a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney; and shall provide that: 
Unless released by the city, this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.

    Written authorization to proceed with building site or parking area clearing (part B of permit) shall be obtained from the planning and zoning department by an owner or developer prior to the cutting of trees or further removal of any vegetation within the previously approved and staked-out site. This authorization shall be granted only after an authorized representative of the city has inspected the site to verify that no unauthorized clearing has taken place, and to ascertain whether field modification of the plan is justified in order to enhance tree preservation on the site. This part B authorization will allow the removal of the trees and vegetation within the previously approved staked out building site, including approved access to the proposed building location. This part B authorization generally allows clearing of the area ten feet outside of the actual building wall, except for those trees or areas specifically delineated on the approved site plan or by the city after field inspection. Unless specifically permitted in the written part B authorization, no filling or excavation on the site shall take place until the final inspection of previously permitted clearing has been completed and such work is found to be in compliance with this Land Development Code, the Code of Ordinances and the written permit requirements and conditions.

Sec. 53-468. - Review criteria. 
(a)  Building code variances. When reviewing an application for a variance, the construction regulation board and city council shall consider the following criteria: 
(1)  Special circumstances exist which are peculiar to the particular property or structure, and which are not applicable to similar properties or structures in general. 
(2)  The special circumstances do not result from the direct actions of the applicant. 
(3)  Literal interpretation of this Land Development Code would result in unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(4)  The granting of the variance is consistent with the overall intent of this Land Development Code, and will not result in increased danger or reduced safety to the owner or general public. 
The criteria in subsection (a) of this section shall be used to determine the justification for granting of relief from requirements of this Land Development Code. All variance requests shall demonstrate the application of each criterion to the specific case. 
(b)  All other variances. The following criteria shall apply in all variance cases other than those relating to building and fire codes: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. 
(2)  The special conditions and circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant. 
(3)  Literal interpretation and enforcement of the development code regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the development code, and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(4)  The variance, if granted, is the minimum variance necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(5)  Granting of the variance request will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the development code to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
(6)  The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Land Development Code, and will not be injurious to the surrounding properties or detrimental to the public welfare. 
The criteria in subsection (b) of this section shall be used to determine the justification for granting of relief from requirements of the development code. All variance requests shall demonstrate the application of each criterion to the specific case. 
(c)  Financial hardship. Financial disadvantages or inconvenience to the applicant shall not of themselves constitute conclusive evidence of unnecessary and undue hardship and be grounds to justify granting of a variance. 
(d)  Physical hardship. Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, variances may be granted under the authority of the Americans with Disabilities Act as reasonable accommodations based on the disabilities of any applicant or a member of the applicant's household. For purposes herein, the terms "reasonable accommodation" and "disabilities" shall have the meanings provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
(e)  Hardship related to provision of personal wireless communications. Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, variances may be granted to any person applying for a permit for personal wireless communications-related development, from any requirement of this Land Development Code which, as applied to such person, would have the "effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless communication services," as that phrase is used in section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

(b)  Transfer of variances. Variances run with the property and the use of a variance may be transferred to another party for use on the same property. 
(c)  Expiration of variance approval. A variance that has not been utilized within two years of being granted shall not be utilized without a new public hearing in accordance with requirements of this chapter.

    The director of the planning and zoning department shall approve an application to modify or eliminate a condition or part thereof, or a restrictive covenant or part thereof (except where the covenant requires a public hearing), where it is demonstrated by the following that the condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof either is satisfied or is moot: 
(1)  Satisfied conditions, covenants, or restrictions. The requirements imposed by a condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof do not create a continuing obligation, and are fully completed or satisfied; and, in the case of a restrictive covenant, any procedural or approval requirement set forth in the covenant is satisfied. Applications under this section must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit that the conditions of this subsection have been satisfied. 
(2)  Moot conditions, covenants, or restrictions. The condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof is moot in that it can no longer serve the purpose for which it was imposed. A condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof in effect for a period of more than five years shall be determined to be moot upon demonstration of any of the four following reasons: 
a.  The purpose of the condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof is apparent from the zoning record of the subject property, including record facts pertaining to the character of the subject property and its immediate vicinity, and the impacts that were projected to be generated by the zoning action at the time the condition or covenant was imposed and either of the following: 
1.  The property subject to the condition or covenant has been developed in a manner or to an extent which does not, and under existing zoning approvals cannot, generate the adverse impacts intended to be prevented or mitigated by the condition or covenant; or 
2.  Since the imposition of the condition or covenant, all abutting parcels and the immediate vicinity have been zoned or developed in a manner or to an extent that the impacts previously anticipated or projected to be prevented or mitigated by the condition or restrictive covenant are not, and cannot be, adverse to the abutting parcels or the immediate vicinity. 
b.  The purpose of the condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof is not apparent from the zoning record of the subject property, including record facts pertaining to the character of the subject property and its immediate vicinity and the following: 
1.  The condition, restrictive covenant or part thereof if imposed under current circumstances, would not and could not mitigate or prevent any describable harm or create any describable benefit to the public or to owners or residents of property in the immediate vicinity to a degree that is greater than de minimus; and 
2.  The condition or restrictive covenant does not include a date of expiration. 
c.  The condition or restrictive covenant for which modification or elimination is sought involves the timing or phasing of development and the following: 
1.  The development which is the subject of the condition or restrictive covenant is completed; and 
2.  No enforcement action regarding the condition or restrictive covenant has been initiated. 
d.  The condition or restrictive covenant for which modification or elimination is sought involves only the timeliness of filing or recording of a document and the following: 
1.  The failure to file or record the document was due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, or to excusable neglect; 
2.  No one is prejudiced by the modification or elimination of the condition or restrictive covenant regarding the timing of the filing or recording; and 
3.  The document has been recorded or filed subsequent to the deadline set by the original approval, and accepted by the city.

(2)  The request does not include a modification or elimination of conditions or restrictive covenants imposed simultaneously with a district boundary change; 
(3)  The modification or elimination of the condition, restrictive covenant, or part thereof will not create new adverse impacts. The application will be deemed not to create new adverse impacts upon demonstration of the following: 
a.  The modification or elimination will result in an increase of not more than ten percent in trips generated above that generated by the approved development, except that trips generated in excess of ten percent shall be permitted where completely mitigated by increased capacity constructed since the current development was approved. Trip generation shall be calculated based on the most current methodology applied by the county; 
b.  The modification or elimination will result in an increase in projected demand for local parks of no more than ten percent or one fifth acre, whichever is greater, except that demand in excess of ten percent or one fifth of an acre shall be permitted if there is sufficient capacity of local parks to accommodate the increase in demand created by the modification; 
c.  The modification or elimination will result in an increase in demand placed on public stormwater drainage systems of not more than ten percent;

l.  The modification or elimination will not result in any material decrease in the privacy enjoyed by adjoining properties; 
m.  The modification or elimination will not result in any material diminution of an existing view or vista to any landmark, natural area, or waterbody from any window or door in any residential unit on an adjoining parcel of land; 
n.  The modification or elimination will not result in any material increase in the potential for vehicular-pedestrian conflicts; 
o.  The modification or elimination will not result in any material and obvious departure from the aesthetic character of the immediate vicinity, taking into account the architectural design, scale, height, mass and building materials of existing structures, pattern of development and open space; 
p.  The modification or elimination will not result in any material increase in the area of shadow, or of light from outdoor lighting, cast onto adjacent parcels; 
q.

(a)  An application for a certificate of concurrency and capacity shall be filed with the community development coordinator as part of an application for development approval and shall include such fees as are required by chapter 62, articles III-XII of chapter 53 and any other applicable code and chapter. 
(b)  The director of the department of planning and zoning shall review the application and determine whether the application complies with the standards established in this chapter if the director of the department of planning and zoning determines that the application complies with the standards, a certificate of concurrency and capacity shall be issued and shall be valid for a period of two years or such later period as may be provided for in a development approval. 
(c)  In the event that an application for a certificate of concurrency and capacity is approved, the applicant shall pay prior to the issuance of the certificate, a fee in the form of prepayment of the capacity being reserved, or some other financial assurance provided by the applicant that is acceptable to the city. The certificate of concurrency and capacity fee may be refunded if development does not proceed so long as the city has not expended or obligated the money for preconstruction costs or construction of the facility, if the road impact fee has not been transferred to the county. If the road impact fee portion has been transferred to the county, the applicant may request a refund from the county. 
(d)  A certificate of concurrency and capacity may be extended according to the same terms and conditions as the underlying development approval. If a development approval is granted an extension, the certificate of concurrency and capacity, if any, shall also be extended. 
(e)  A certificate of concurrency and capacity may be extended to remain in effect for the life of each subsequent development approval for the same parcel, as long as the applicant obtains a subsequent development approval prior to the expiration of the earlier development approval. 
(f)  A certificate of concurrency and capacity runs with the land and is valid only for subsequent development approvals for the same parcel and to new owners of the original parcel for which it was issued. 
(g)  A certificate of concurrency and capacity shall expire if the underlying development order expires or is revoked by the city and the capacity has not been extended to a subsequent development approval for the same parcel. 
(h)  A denial of a certificate of concurrency and capacity may be appealed in the manner provided in articles III-XII of chapter 53.

Sec. 59-76. - Purpose. 
(a)  The goal of this division is to ensure proposed developments are within the accepted level of service thresholds mandated by state law, and if transportation improvements are needed to mitigate the site's generated traffic impact. 
(b)  Based on the number, location, and type of traffic counts the levels of transportation analysis in this division is required for proposed new developments in the city. Each level is determined by the number of trips the project will generate, as stated in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual. Each level of analysis is a minimum threshold and may be exceeded by the applicant. The city may require additional analysis to address site specific issues if desired.

(1)  Project methodology meeting. This meeting shall be held between the applicant and the city, to discuss the methodology, study area, requirements, format and submission dates. 
(2)  Data needs. 
a.  Traffic counts including trucks. May include pedestrians if requested by the city. 
1.  Two-hour peak periods (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. or any other time period depending on the type of development) intersection turning movement counts (TMCs) on the four intersections most impacted by the proposed development. 
2.  Roadway link counts (hourly for 72 hours) shall be collected on the four links most impacted by the proposed development. Additional link counts may be necessary if the site's generated impact is ten percent or more of the link's highest existing two-way peak hour traffic volumes. 
All counts shall adhere to the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual on Uniform Traffic Studies and other applicable standards. 
b.  Signals location and timing (if applicable). Traffic signals shall be identified by the county asset identification. Existing signal phasing and timing shall be utilized in the analysis. 
c.  Trip generation, distribution and assignment. 
1.  All trip generation information should be based on the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. 
2.  Trip distribution shall begin by defining the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) number for the project location. Distribute trips using the project's TAZ and related data from the current adopted county MPO long range transportation plan. 
d.  Committed developments. All committed developments within the study area shall be quantified. This data should be collected from the city and the county's department of planning and zoning. It will include all developments that have entered the concurrency application process, yet have not been constructed, within the study area, as defined by the city planning and zoning department, generally within a one mile radius of the project. If quantifiable data can not be reasonably obtained, an alternative method will be to apply an annual growth factor, developed according to accepted professional practice, in consultation with and approved by the city. 
e.  Future transportation projects. To counterbalance subtractions from transportation network capacity, future transportation projects, which add capacity to the network shall be quantified. These must be represented as approved and funded projects, set for implementation within one year of project opening, within the MPO's adopted transportation improvement program (TIP) and/or the city's program. 
f.  Build-out year. This represents a date in the future in which the facility and development will be operational. It shall be used as the date for future conditions analysis. 
(3)  Level of service analysis. 
a.  Capacity, level of service, and operational analyses for the selected four intersections and four roadway links for the morning and evening peak hours or any other periods as well as for additional intersections and/or links as may be determined by the city. 
b.  Capacity, level of service, and operational analyses on all driveways providing access to and from the site, for the same time period as above. 
c.  Using the data collected, including trucks, analyses will be undertaken to portray the existing conditions, future conditions with committed developments, and the future conditions with the project and committed developments. All analyses shall be done utilizing the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual methodologies. Other measures such as vehicular delay, volume to capacity ratios, and vehicular queue length, among others, may be required by the city. Determine site's impacts and identify improvements recommendations to mitigate impacts if applicable. 
1.  Existing condition. 
2.  Future condition with committed developments. 
3.  Future conditions with project and committed development. 
d.  If the site is to have gates to control access, then the appropriate analyses shall be performed to determine vehicular queue lengths waiting to enter the site and their impact on the adjacent roadways.

State department of transportation (FDOT) Art-Plan or Q/LOS methodology is acceptable. Other analysis software may be used subject to approval by the city. 
(b)  Parking. The need and requirements for a parking analysis will be determined by the city in the initial project methodology meeting. Parking required for the facility will depend upon project programming, taking into account the number of units, and the square footage of the retail and commercial space. Parking analysis shall consist of determining if planned parking for the development meets or exceeds the city's requirements. 
(c)  Additions, deletions, or changes to existing land uses. If the resulting additional generated two-way hourly traffic volume, highest peak hour of adjacent street, is ten percent or less of the total site's generated traffic, then there is no need to assess traffic impact, unless the additional generated traffic will cause the adjacent roadway to exceed concurrency thresholds. This shall be documented and submitted by the applicant or his designee. 
(d)  In cases where the resulting new generated traffic will be less than the existing, it shall then be documented and submitted by the applicant or his designee.

Chapter 62 - DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS TRANSFER TDR[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference- Transfer of development rights, F.S. §§ 163.3177(11)(f), 163.3202(3). 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 62-1. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and cited as the "City of Doral TDR Transfer of Development Rights Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 3, 2-22-2006) 
Sec. 62-2. - Purpose and applicability. 
    This chapter is intended to provide for greater flexibility in the pattern of development by allowing for the transfer of development rights (unused floor area and density) from one parcel to another where such transfers will assist in the renewal, rehabilitation, and where preservation of open space, natural resources, preservation of view corridors, provision of educational or other public purpose objective may be achieved through such shifts in the development pattern, upon the approval of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 4(a), 2-22-2006) 
Sec. 62-3. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Comprehensive plan means the comprehensive plan of the city. 
    Development rights means a development right, an appurtenant right of land ownership that has an economic value separate from the land itself, subject to reasonable regulation by local government under its police power. The term "development rights" means the density or intensity can be transferred from a sender site as defined in this section, by the owner of that site, to a receiving site as defined in this section, through gift or sale. 
    Director means the city manager, or his designee, as may be amended from time to time by the city manager. 
    LDR means the land development regulations of the city consistent with the comprehensive plan of the city. 
    Receiver sites means parcels of land located within one of the approved districts as set forth herein below to which development rights may be transferred and used. 
    Receiving districts means areas within the corporate boundaries of the city that are permitted to receive transferable development rights as defined in the city's comprehensive plan and as reflected in the map of receiver districts attached to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. The map of receiver districts is on file in the city offices. 
    Sender sites means parcels of land located in which development rights can be severed, to be transferred to a receiver site. 
    Sending districts means any area within the corporate boundaries of the city that are permitted to transfer development rights as permitted by and as set forth in this chapter. 
    Sever means the removal of a development right from property rights possessed by an owner of real property. The term "sever" connotes a removal or separation, in perpetuity, as distinguished from a restriction or limitation, which may be overridden, deleted or is subject to a time frame. 
    Transferable development rights means a development right is an appurtenant right of land ownership that has an economic value separate from the land itself, subject to reasonable regulation by local government under its police power, and may be transferred from the land from which the right is severed (sender site) to another piece of land (receiver site). Once severed, and if only a portion of the development rights attributable to a sender site is transferred, the remaining rights may be banked by the city as described below. Units transferred shall be composed of square footage only and may be made through gift or sale of those units. These rights are sometimes referred to hereunder as "TDRs". 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 4(b), 2-22-2006) 
Secs. 62-4-62-23. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES 

Sec. 62-24. - Establishment of sender sites. 
    Any property in any zoning district, upon the specific approval by the city council, at the council's sole discretion may be eligible as a sending site; provided however, that the severance and transfer of right, from that site shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(1)  City-owned sender sites. With respect to city-owned sender sites, all development rights calculated in square footage severed therefrom, shall be deposited in a bank more particularly described in article III of this chapter from which withdrawals of those rights may be made after purchase by a private developer upon specific approval by the city council at a public hearing as described in section 62-28 and in accordance with the other terms of this chapter. In no case shall the transfer of any TDR's from a city-owned site currently designated as park sites interfere with the use of those public parks and said parks shall forever remain as public parks. 
(2)  Privately owned sender sites. The city council, at its sole discretion, may approve at a public hearing as described in article III of this chapter, a privately owned sender site to allow it to transfer square footage for commercial, office, retail or units for residential which shall be either utilized or transferred for purposes of computing density or intensity to a receiver site, provided that upon the initial transfer from privately owned sender sites, ownership of part or all of the sender sites or other land, funds, or a combination thereof, as specified herein, shall be transferred to the city, and to be utilized only for the accomplishment of a public purpose consistent with the comprehensive plan, including, but not limited to, the creation of public parks, plazas and/or open space, the conservation of historic, sensitive, environmental and archeological resources, the protection and enhancement of waterfront, public access corridors not otherwise required by this Land Development Code, or the development of public educational facilities and other essential public facilities, including, but not limited to, recreational, public works, maintenance and operational facilities on the sender site. 
(a)  In furtherance thereof, the entire sender site or a portion thereof shall be dedicated to public ownership or preserved for any public purpose. The amount conveyed shall correspond to the density of use and/or units transferred to the receiver site. Taxes on privately owned sender sites shall be paid by the owner, until actual transfer of such land to the city. The sender site shall be unencumbered, free and clear of any or all liens and mortgages prior to dedication and transfer of said site. The sender site shall be dedicated to the public either by the transfer of fee title to the city or perpetual deed restriction or easement, in a form acceptable to the city. 
(b)  In lieu of the transfer of ownership of part or all of a sender site, a private owner may proffer an amount of money equal to or greater than the fair market value of the entire sender site or the corresponding portion thereof, valued under the use, zoning, and other entitlements associated with the site assessed prior to the successful completion of a transfer of any development right, with the use of such funds limited to the same purpose as specified in section (a) herein. 
(c)  In lieu of the transfer of ownership of part or all of a sender site, a private owner may also proffer other land not located in the sender site the fair market value of which equal to or greater than the fair market value of the entire sender site or the corresponding portion thereof, valued under the use, zoning, and other entitlements associated with the site assessed prior to the successful completion of a transfer of any development right, with the use of such land limited to the same purpose as specified in section (a) herein. 
(d)  In lieu of the transfer of ownership of part or all of a sender site, a private owner may also proffer a combination of any of the following: land from the sender site, land from an outside site, and a predetermined amount of money, provided that the combination proffered by the private owner yields a value to the city that is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the entire sender site or the corresponding portion thereof, valued under the use, zoning, and other entitlements associated with the site assessed prior to the successful completion of a transfer of any development right. 
(e)  The owner of the sender site will be permitted to bank in accordance with article III of this chapter any remaining rights from the site for a five-year period. At the expiration of the five-year period, the TDR's shall expire and become extinguished and unusable. 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 5(a)(1), (2), 2-22-2006; Ord. No. 2015-23 , § 2, 5-20-2015) 
Sec. 62-25. - Establishment of receiver sites. 
    All property within the city are herewith established as receiver sites for the acceptance of transferred development rights. Receiver sites may be developed as otherwise permitted by this Land Development Code, as may be amended from time to time, in combination with the development rights available to the site, provided that the overall density achieved is consistent with, and does not exceed, the overall density and intensity allowable by the comprehensive plan. If an approval was granted prior to the adoption of this section, pursuant to which a permit has been issued, that site shall not be available as a receiver site, unless the prior approval is revoked and a new development order is secured hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 5(a)(3), 2-22-2006) 
Sec. 62-26. - Calculations. 
(a)  Transferable development rights from city-owned property. In the case of city-owned sites, calculations will be based on the zoning permissible at the time of incorporation and prior to the city's acquisition of the site for public purposes. A transferable development right for a unit shall be calculated and determined by the permitted density of the sending site. Only whole units may be purchased and transferred to the receiver. All of the foregoing, however, is subject to all limitations set forth herein and in the city's comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Cost of transferable development rights from city-owned site. Upon receiving approval by the city council for a transfer of a development right to a receiver site, the cost for a unit of development right shall be determined by the market value of the receiver site as delineated by a current real estate appraisal prepared for the city by a city designated appraiser, acceptable by the city manager, but paid for by the owner of the sending site. Since the issuance of city-owned TDRs shall be from a bank, the formula set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be applied to the totality of the banked units (density) based on the average of the underlying zoning. 
(c)  Transferable development rights from private property. In the case of privately owned sites, the city shall determine density on the site. In order to determine density, the applicant shall file a proposed site plan that demonstrates compliance with the underlying land use and zoning. The proposed site plan must be approved by all relevant governmental jurisdictions as required by the planning and zoning director. If the present zoning classification of the property is not consistent with the future land use designation than the applicant must ensure the most appropriate zoning designation, as determined by the planning and zoning director, when proposing a site plan. The parties shall file documentation verifying such transfer of rights in accordance with section 62-28. 
(d)  Cost of transferable development rights issued by private owners. Upon receiving approval by the city council, which approval is in its sole discretion, of the sender site as a site acceptable for the use as a public property, the price of the transferable development rights shall be determined by the private owners. 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 5(b), 2-22-2006) 
Sec. 62-27. - Development limitations. 
(a)  Development limitations upon privately owned sending sites. Prior to exercise of the transferable development rights issued by a transferee (the receiving site) pursuant to this section, the property owner of the sending site (transferor) shall deliver to the city a current survey, a warranty deed conveying good, marketable and insurable title along with a Form B title policy pertaining to the sending site, once staff has determined it wishes to accept that site and the city council has subsequently approved such acceptance as recreational or other approved public purpose use, or open space use in accordance with the expressed intent of this section. Upon approval by the city council and receipt of conveyance documents and title insurance policy by the city, correction of any outdoor code violations and payment of all fines due and owing to the city, then and only in that event shall the city authorize the release of the transferable development rights and documents same in its records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the property owner of the sending site may dedicate the sender site by perpetual deed restriction or easement, in a form acceptable to the city. 
(b)  Development limitations upon receiving sites. 
(1)  Within the receiving districts, development rights shall be limited by a combination of the underlying zoning regulations, approved bonuses and allowable development rights transferable to the land in the receiving districts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and in accordance with the comprehensive plan, neither the transferable density or intensity of permitted uses shall exceed 20 percent of the maximum residential, commercial or industrial density permitted on the receiver site and in no case shall the resulting density bonus increases on any given receiver site exceed the number of dwelling units attainable on the sender sites under these plan provisions so as to ensure no net increase in city-wide residential, commercial or industrial density comprehensive plan capacities occurs. 
(2)  Parking and all other requirements of this Land Development Code shall be required in accordance with any additional density acquired through the transfer of development rights. 
(3)  All TDR's purchased or transferred shall be used within 24 months from the date of obtaining zoning approval or said rights shall thereafter be fully extinguished. 
(4)  The transfer of development rights to a receiving site will not decrease required open space, buffers, setbacks or cause a request for variances or any other adverse impact to surrounding site or increase allowable height, if applicable. 
(5)  No property upon which a prior approval was granted may apply for transferable development rights unless a site plan application is made for the entire site. 
(6)  All monies received by the city in connection with the transfer of development rights from city-owned sites shall be utilized for capital improvements only. 
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 5(c), 2-22-2006) 
Sec. 62-28. - Procedures. 
(a)  Application. An applicant for the transfer of development rights shall file an application with the planning and zoning director, who shall place the request on the agenda of the city council, after it is determined that the application is complete and all other requirements have been complied with. Every application shall contain the signatures of the fee simple owners of all properties involved, a description of adjacent lands, including land uses, densities, circulation systems, public facilities and the impact, if any, of the transfer of development rights. The application shall be subject to the same notice and hearing requirements that are required for zoning applications under this Land Development Code. A fee for the consideration of this application shall be set from time-to-time by the city council. The applicant shall be responsible for consultant fees pursuant to the city's fee schedule. Such application shall include the following: 
(1)  The application shall include plans, construction schedules, site conditions map including a perspective and/or mass model of the proposed development potential as compared to the development potential utilizing the proposed transfer of development rights, status of financing, if applicable, consideration including purchase price of the property, if applicant is a contract purchaser and a general description of the manner in which the project shall be construed. The plans shall include, but not be limited to, a site plan elevation, landscaping, an area analysis of surrounding properties including, but not limited to, street elevations, height of buildings, surrounding floor area ratio and density, impact, if any, of the transfer of development right to adjacent properties, copies of any covenants affecting the receiver and sending site, and any other agreements required by this section and this Land Development Code. 
(2)  Every application should include the signature of all fee simple owners of all properties involved in the application (sender and receiver sites). 
(b)  Reviewing by planning and zoning director. The planning and zoning director shall review the application and shall make findings of fact and recommend the application to the city council, which may approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny such application, within their sole discretion. 
(c)  Scheduling of hearing. Prior to a hearing being scheduled on the eligibility, of a site for either the city's acceptance or for the transfer of development rights to a receiver site, all documents required hereunder for the transfer of development rights including, but not limited to, a current survey, appraisal and all proposed conveyance documents shall have been reviewed and approved by city staff prior to the scheduling of any hearing. 
(d)  Review by city council. 
(1)  The city council shall review the application and the findings and recommendation of the planning and zoning director and after notice and hearing as required under this Land Development Code, may approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny the application for transfer of development rights at its sole discretion. An approval shall be conditioned upon delivery to the city of an executed grant of easement creating a development limitation set forth in section 62-27, as recording copies of same together with a copy of the approval resolution in the property records for the county, and may include other reasonable conditions. The city council shall review the application based on the following criteria; provided, however, that whether or not the application is approved is solely within city council's discretion: 
a.  The project is consistent with the comprehensive plan and will not reduce the levels of service set forth in the plan. 
b.  The project is consistent with the intent of these regulations set forth in this section. 
c.  The project meets all other criteria set forth in this Land Development Code. 
d.  The transfer of development rights is desirable on the individual site being considered for purposes of enhancing overall development and the sender site is dedicated to public ownership or preserved for public purpose to a conservation easement or other recordable mechanism, creating view corridors, improving pedestrian environment, public right-of-way and publicly owned property, accomplishing the public purpose that is consistent with the comprehensive plan and article III of this chapter. The sender site shall be dedicated to the public either by the transfer of fee title to the city or perpetual deed restriction or easement, in a form acceptable to the city. 
e.  The development on the receiving site shall be designed to produce an environment of desirable character and harmony with the neighborhood, resulting in a superior quality of development and open space relationships with high standards for recreational and parking areas. The transfer of these rights shall create a logical and superior pattern of development, which would not otherwise occur if the property were developed without them. 
(2)  If the city council finds the transfer of development rights on any given site meets the foregoing criteria, it may approve, with or without conditions, by ordinance, such transfer. 
(e)  Transfer process. A hearing on the eligibility of a site to send or receive a transfer of rights may occur simultaneously with the zoning application, but the transfer may not occur until a second public hearing has been held and the city council has made a determination within its sole discretion. The actual conveyance shall require a separate public hearing (second reading to be finally approved and the issuance of the ordinance approving such transfer shall automatically change the TDR map). 
(f)  Consultants. Hiring of consultants to review data including engineering, planning, legal, appraisal, technical or environmental issue, shall be chargeable to the applicant in accordance with the city's fee schedule. 
(g)  Recording of documents. Thirty days after the passage of the ordinance approving a transfer of development rights, that transfer shall be recorded by the applicant in the public records of the county on both the sender and receiver sites and an irrevocable covenant running against the land shall be recorded on the receiving site, including the additional density, required parking and any other conditions imposed by the city council. The owner of the receiver site shall agree to bind itself, its successors and assigns of the property and development with regard to all conditions, and no changes may occur without approval by the city council that was involved in the initial approval. In the event no building permit is issued within 24 months from the date of approval, the TDRs reflected in the public records shall be extinguished and the recorded documents shall contain a warning to that effect so the any buyer of the property shall be so informed. 
(h)  Official zoning atlas and future land use map. The official zoning atlas and future land use map must be updated to reflect the transfer.

The fee shall be collected by the planning and zoning department for all structures for which a building permit is issued. Such fee will be based on the capital cost of roadway improvements required to serve any increase in transportation requirements resulting from proposed development activities together with impact fee administrative costs. The formula to be used to calculate the roadway improvement impact fee shall be as follows: 
a.  Step 1. Compute total daily trips for the proposed development using the latest published edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation handbook using the following Institute of Transportation Engineers land use codes (LUC): 
1.  Residential land uses. For residential land uses, use appropriate trip generation rates per dwelling unit from the latest available version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation (TG) publication to reflect the actual number and type of residential units. Use the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the corresponding land use codes such as: 210, 220-224, 230-233, 240, 251-255, 260 and 270. 
2.  Office land use. For office land uses, use appropriate trip generation rate from the latest available version of Institute of Transportation Engineers trip generation publication to reflect land use in 1,000 square feet area. Use latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the land use code No. 710, general office building. 
3.  Industrial and warehouse land use. For industrial and warehouse land uses, use appropriate trip generation rate from the latest available version of Institute of Transportation Engineers trip generation publication to reflect land use in 1,000 square feet area. Use latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the land use code No. 150, warehousing. 
4.  Retail land use. For retail land uses, including, but not limited to, restaurants, pharmacy/drug stores, commercial banks, specialty retail, discount stores, convenience markets, supermarkets, etc. use appropriate trip generation rate from the latest available version of Institute of Transportation Engineers trip generation publication to reflect land use in 1,000 square feet area. Use latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the land use code No. 820, shopping center. 
5.  Houses of worship, churches or synagogues. For houses of worship, churches or synagogues, use latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the land use code No. 560, church, weekday trip generation rate per 1,000 square feet of area. 
6.  Hotels. For all hotels use daily trip generation rates per room using latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation handbook for the land use code No. 310, hotel. 
7.  Mixed use projects. For purpose of this section, a mixed-use project shall be defined as a construction development containing a proportionate combination of two or more uses as permitted by the underlying future land use category. It is recognized that the internal trip-making characteristics of multi-use development sites are directly related to the type mix of onsite land uses and shall be quantified for the purposes of determining impact fees for mixed use projects. The internal capture trips rates vary by the size and land use types within the project site. For mixed use projects, the internal capture rates amongst use shall be as determined by the 2nd edition of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook, except that different components within the same classification of use (i.e. single family and multi-family) shall be combined within the single classification, and hotel use shall be classified under the residential land use category for internal capture purposes. 
8.  Other uses. For other land uses not listed above, consult with and obtain approval from the city regarding use of the appropriate daily trip generation rate. 
b.  Step 2. Multiply the total daily trips as computed in step 1 above by the impact fee cost per daily trip of $190.43. 
c.  Step 3. Multiply the total from step 2 by 1.05 to accommodate the general administrative charge of five percent in effect at the time of adoption of this ordinance. This formula will change automatically upon any change to the administrative charge. 
d.  Total. The resulting total is the roadway improvement impact fee and administrative charge which shall be paid by the feepayer. 
e.  Administrative charge to be reviewed annually. The city shall review the administrative charge on at least an annual basis to ensure that this charge continues to approximate the costs to the city of administering the program. Any necessary adjustment shall be made by the city manager, and the formula set forth in step 3 above shall be automatically amended to reflect any changes to the administrative costs. 
(2)  Periodic review of impact costs. The city manager shall periodically review the contents, including the impact fee cost per daily trip rate of $190.43 of this article and, if appropriate, make recommendations for revisions to the ordinance from which this article is derived to the city council. The city council shall consider the city manager's recommended revisions to the ordinance from which this article is derived periodically. The manager's recommendations and the council's action shall ensure that the benefits to a fee paying development shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of mitigating road impacts, and the procedures for administering the impact fee process remain efficient. 
(3)  Activities not specified. If the type of activity within the proposed or current development is not specified, the city manager or his designee shall use the activity most nearly comparable in computing the fee. 
(f)  Roadway improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee. 
(1)  In lieu of payment of all or part of the road impact fee, the public works director may accept the offer of a fee payer to construct all or part of an off-site roadway improvement in connection with any development activity. All improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the City of Doral's Capital Improvement Program. Such improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be credited against payment of an impact fee in the amount determined by the public works director pursuant to subsection (e) or (f). The total amount of contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not exceed the road cost portion of the impact fee formula in subsection (e). Improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not be applied to the five percent city administrative cost portion of the impact fee which shall remain the responsibility of the fee payer and must be paid at the time of building permit issuance. 
Where a fee payer seeks to apply an improvement contribution in-lieu-of-fee credit against payment of the road impact fee, the administrative fee portion of the impact fee shall be the sum of: (i) five percent of the value of the improvement contribution in-lieu-of-fee or $1,000.00, whichever is less, and (ii) five percent of the remaining road cost not satisfied by the improvement contribution in-lieu-of-fee. 
Previously approved improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fees that are: (i) unused and (ii) based on a net road cost which has been subsequently adjusted, shall be entitled to an adjustment equal to the percentage increase or decrease of the net road cost in the road impact fee formula. Previously approved improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fees which are: (i) unused and (ii) based on a road cost which has been subsequently adjusted, shall be entitled to an adjustment equal to the percentage increase or decrease of the road cost in the road impact fee formula. Any such adjustment shall only be utilized to offset road impact fees and shall not be refundable. 
(2)  An offer by a fee payer to construct road improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee must be accompanied by plans in sufficient detail to permit the public works director to determine that city, county, or state design standards will be used and to determine the cost of such improvements. 
(3)  The public works director may accept or reject an offer of improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee. When such improvements are not consistent with standards set forth in the impact fee manual the public works director may reject the offer of contributions in-lieu-of-fee. If rejected, the public works director shall state in writing the reasons for the rejection. Any appeal from such a decision of the public works director to reject improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall be reviewed by the city council. 
(4)  If the public works director accepts an offer of improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee, the fee payer shall post a bond or letter of credit with the public works director equal to 110 percent of the cost of the agreed to improvement as determined by the public works director. Upon receipt of such bond, the city entity may issue building permits for that part of the proposed development determined by the city to be satisfied by the contributions in-lieu-of-fee. Release of such bonds for contributions in-lieu-of-fee shall not be issued by either the city until such contributed improvements have been completed and accepted by the public works director, county, or the state. 
(5)  If pursuant to subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2), the public works director accepts improvements with a cost in excess of the impact fee computed pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) herein, the fee payer, upon written request, shall be reimbursed for the amount of the excess cost as said cost is determined by the public works director pursuant to this subsection (f). It shall be the burden of the fee payer to make a written request for reimbursement at the time of building permit application. The fee payer shall only be eligible for reimbursement after such time as the improvement is completed and accepted by the public works director, county, or the state. Reimbursements shall be made from available monies existing within the corresponding benefit district trust fund. No reimbursement shall be made after six years from the date of first building permit issuance. 
(6)  Any provisions for improvement contributions in lieu of road impact fees included as a condition of a development of regional impact development order must be approved by the public works director prior to approval of the final development order for county development orders or subsequently ratified by the public works director in the case of municipal development orders. 
(7)  Any off-site improvements required of a development activity in order to meet transportation concurrency requirements shall not qualify as improvement contributions that may be offered by the fee payer and accepted by the city for the purpose of this section. This provision shall not affect development activity subject to a master or other development agreement which specifically identifies off-site improvements. 
(8)  Any claim for improvement contributions in lieu of road impact fee shall have been submitted to and received approval from the public works director prior to issuance of any building permit intended to use said contributions in lieu of fee and prior to commencement of any road construction or dedication of any right-of-way for which said contributions in lieu of fee are being claimed. 
(9)  Authorized improvement contributions in lieu of fees are not site-transferable and may only be applied against the impact fees due for developments within the parent tract (development property) of the application for which the off-site contributions were made and authorized. Allocations of contributions in lieu of fees to sub-parcels within the parent tract shall be on based on the prorated area (square footage or acreage) unless an alternative allocation or reallocation has been approved by the public works director. 
(10)  The fee payer shall pay a nonrefundable administrative cost in the amount set forth in the road impact fee manual to be used by the county for processing and review of the contributions in lieu of fee study. This fee shall not be credited against the amount of road impact fees due. 
(11)  Determination of the amount of improvement contributions in lieu of road impact fees to be accepted shall be determined by the public works director based on a review of the documentation provided by the fee payer and current cost information. Any increase in this amount due to changes in construction plans must be authorized in advance by the public works director. 
(12)  Previously approved improvement contributions in-lieu-of-fee that have not yet been used may be re-adjusted based on the percentage increase or decrease in the net-road cost as recalculated pursuant to subsection (d) or (e). Any such adjustment may be applied toward payment of road impact fees but shall not be refundable. 
(g)  Land or equipment contributions in-lieu-of-fee. 
(1)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, a credit shall be granted against the impact fees imposed by this section for the donation of additional land which would not be required by the city for improvements required of the subject development activity, or equipment made pursuant to a contribution in lieu of impact fee agreement. Such donations shall be subject to the approval of the public works director. No credit shall be given for the donation of land unless such property is conveyed, in fee simple to the city without remuneration. 
(2)  Prior to the impact fee payment due date pursuant to section 65-73, the feepayer shall submit to public works director a proposed plan for donations or contributions. The proposed plan shall include: 
a.  A legal description of any land proposed to be donated and a written appraisal; 
b.  A list of the equipment or description of construction improvement sought to be donated; 
c.  A written statement of the actual cost for any equipment or construction improvement to be donated; and 
d.  A proposed time schedule for completion of the proposed plan. 
(3)  The public works director shall review the proposed plan and determine if the proposed donation of land or equipment by the feepayer is consistent with the public interest. 
(4)  The value of donated capital equipment shall be based upon actual costs of acquisition of capital equipment as shown by a manufacturer's or supplier's invoice or construction cost of the improvement. 
(5)  The feepayer contribution credit granted shall only be applied as a credit against the particular impact fee which provides the funds for the specific capital facility which is the subject of the donation. 
(h)  Exemptions. 
(1)  Alterations, expansion or replacement of an existing development where the use is not changed and the number of total daily trips is not increased shall not be subject to the roadway improvement impact fee. The burden of demonstrating the previous existence of a use or structure or previous payment of impact fee shall be upon the feepayer. In cases where there is an existing use, any additional fees shall be based upon the alteration to the existing use or structure. 
(2)  Government or public facilities are exempt from the impact fee, including those parcels, grounds, building or structures owned by federal, state, county or the city government, the Miami-Dade County School Board or the South Florida Water Management District and related to the operation of those entities and used for governmental purposes including, but not limited to, governmental offices, police and fire stations, airports, seaports, parking facilities, equipment yards, sanitation facilities, water control structures, schools, parks and similar facilities or through which general government operations are conducted.

DIVISION 2. - TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (TND) 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 68-431. - Intent and purpose. 
    The traditional neighborhood development district (TND) is designed to ensure the development of land along the lines of traditional neighborhoods. Its provisions adapt the urban conventions which were normal in the United States from colonial times until the 1940s. The traditional neighborhood development district (TND) prescribes the following physical conventions: 
(1)  The neighborhood is spatially understood and limited in size. 
(2)  Residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings are interwoven within the neighborhood, all in close proximity. 
(3)  A hierarchy of streets serves equitably the needs of the pedestrian, the bicycle and the automobile. 
(4)  Carefully placed civic buildings, squares, and greens reinforce the identity of the neighborhood. 
(5)  Spatially defined squares, parks, and greens provide places for social activity and recreation. 
(6)  Civic buildings provide places of assembly for social, cultural and religious activities, becoming symbols of community identity through their architectural clarity. 
(7)  Private buildings from a disciplined edge, spatially delineating the public street space and the private block interior. 
(8)  Architecture and landscape respond to the unique character of the region. 
Where the terms, design criteria, development parameters, and review procedure contained herein conflict with those provisions provided elsewhere in the Land Development Code, the provisions of the traditional neighborhood development (TND) district shall apply.

Subdivision II. - Design Criteria 

Sec. 68-445. - Definitions. 
(a)  The design criteria and requirements in this subdivision shall be applicable in the traditional neighborhood development (TND) district. Terms used throughout this subdivision shall take their commonly accepted meaning unless otherwise defined elsewhere in this Land Development Code, including chapter 83, subdivisions. 
(b)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subdivision, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alley means a vehicular passageway providing primary, secondary and/or service access to the sides or rear of building lots. Posted speed shall not exceed 15 miles per hour. 
    Artisanal us e means the manufacture and sale of artifacts utilizing only handheld and/or table-mounted electrical tools contained within an enclosed structure. 
    Block means a combination of building lots serviced by an alley, the perimeter of which abuts public use lands (in most cases public rights-of-way). 
    Building lot means a separately platted portion of private land, not including the specified sidewalk area. 
    Civic building means any permitted or required civic use building when located in a civic use lot. 
    Clear zone means an area beyond the curb radius, so specified, which shall be kept clear of all objects to provide emergency vehicle clearance. 
    Colonnade means a roof or building structure, extending over the sidewalk, open to the street and sidewalk except for supporting columns or piers. Colonnades shall have, at the sidewalk, a minimum clear height of ten feet (excluding signage or lighting) and a minimum clear width of eight feet (from frontage line to inside column face). Colonnades shall be constructed 18 inches to 24 inches from the face of the curb. Awnings are permitted within the traditional neighborhood development (TND) but are not considered colonnades. Colonnades shall not cause roof drainage into the public right-of-way. 
    Congregate living facilities means a group home for a maximum of six resident clients who are cared for by the owner who permanently resides in the residential unit. The facility must be licensed by the state department of children and family services and meet Code criteria for such use. In the shopfront use location the total residents may be in excess of six if the use meets the other requirements of the shopfront use category. Congregate living facilities shall include homes for the aged. 
    Cornice line means a molded and projecting horizontal member that crowns an architectural composition. A cornice line shall project a minimum of two inches from the front elevation of the structure. 
    Curb radius means the curved edge of the street at intersections, measured at the edge of the travel lanes. Curbs at intersections shall not intrude into the intersection beyond the specified maximum curb radius. Where streets of different use categories intersect, the requirements of the higher intensity use shall govern. 
    Front porch means a front porch is an un-air-conditioned roofed structure attached to the front of the unit. A front porch may consist of up to two floors, with the second floor equal or lesser in size to the first. Each floor of a porch shall have a minimum depth of six feet and a minimum width of 12 feet and, except for insect screening, shall only have supporting columns visible above 42 inches from the finished porch floor level. Side and rear porches may encompass a ramp providing access for people with disabilities. 
    Frontage line means the shorter building lot line which coincides to the right-of-way of the street or square. In the case of a building lot abutting upon only one street, the frontage line is the line parallel to and common with the edge of sidewalk. In the case of a corner lot, that part of the building lot having the narrowest frontage on any street shall be considered the frontage line. 
    Green means a public open space located within the neighborhood proper and bounded by streets. Paved areas in greens shall not exceed 20 percent of the green area exclusive of dedicated rights-of-way. Greens shall have a length to width ratio no greater than 4:1. A green may be enclosed with a wrought iron or electrostatic plated aluminum fence not exceeding five feet in height. 
    Greenbelt means an optional open space area adjoining the neighborhood proper and no less than 150 feet wide at any place. The area shall be preserved in perpetuity in its natural condition, or enhanced by the owner, as determined by the county department of environmental resources management.

    Home occupation use means premises used for the transaction of business or the supply of professional services, excluding medical and dental. Such use shall not simultaneously employ more than two persons, one of whom must reside on the property. The total gross area of the home occupational use shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross square footage of the residential unit. Certificates of use and occupancy shall be reviewed annually. Home occupation shall be limited to the following:

(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The provisions of this chapter shall be considered minimum standards and shall apply to all public and private development when a permit is required, except for the following: 
a.  Existing attached and detached single-family and duplex dwellings, including any future additions or expansions. 
b.  Bona fide agricultural activities. Any property receiving an agricultural classification and assessment pursuant to F.S. § 193.461 substantiated by a plan submitted indicating the area with the agricultural classification. 
(2)  Existing development shall only be required to comply with the street tree requirements of section 71-102 and parking lot buffers of section 71-188. This requirement shall not apply to existing attached and detached single-family and duplex dwellings pursuant to subsection (b)(1)a of this section. Parking lot buffers will not be required if inadequate area exists which will cause the elimination of any required parking pursuant to this Land Development Code. The provisions of this subsection shall only apply where a building permit is required for external alterations or where a paving permit is required for expansion of parking areas. Routine maintenance such as reroofing and painting shall not be considered external alterations. 
(3)  In order to address safety concerns, institutional uses, such as, but not limited to military bases, schools, hospitals and similar uses, may vary from this chapter, except for minimum open space requirements, subject to approval by the planning and zoning director. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. VII, § 1), 8-22-2007; Ord. No. 2016-06 , § 2, 6-22-2016) 
Sec. 71-2. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to establish minimum landscape standards for the city that enhance, improve and maintain the quality of the landscape, and to: 
(1)  Promote xeriscape principles through the use of drought-tolerant landscape species, grouping of plant material by water requirements, the use of irrigation systems that conserve the use of potable and nonpotable water supplies and restrictions on the amount of lawn areas. 
(2)  Use landscape material, specifically street trees, to visually define the hierarchy of roadways, and to provide shade and a visual edge along roadways. 
(3)  Prevent the destruction of the community's existing tree canopy and promote its expansion. 
(4)  Promote the use of trees and shrubs for energy conservation by encouraging cooling through the provision of shade and the channeling of breezes, thereby helping to offset global warming and local heat island effects through the added absorption of carbon dioxide and reduction of heat islands. 
(5)  Contribute to the processes of air movement, air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and stormwater runoff retention, while aiding in the abatement of noise, glare, heat, air pollution and dust generated by major roadways and intense use areas. 
(6)  Improve the aesthetic appearance of commercial, industrial and residential development through the use of plant material, thereby protecting and increasing property values within the community, and protecting designated historic landscapes. 
(7)  Reduce the negative impacts of exotic pest plant species and prohibit the use of noxious exotic plants which invade native plant communities. 
(8)  Promote the concept of planting the right tree or plant in the right place to avoid problems such as clogged sewers, cracked sidewalks, damage to homes, buildings, and other structures, and power services interruptions.

Sec. 71-12. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Except during emergency phase II and III water restriction periods imposed by the South Florida Water Management District ("the district") as set forth in this subsection, the department of planning and zoning shall withhold approval of a final building inspection prior to the issuance of a final certificate of use and occupancy or certificate of completion until a preparer's certification of landscape compliance has been submitted and approved. During emergency phase II and III water restriction periods imposed by the district, and subject to written consent by contract purchasers of individual houses or units, the department of planning and zoning is hereby authorized to issue certificates of completion and certificates of use and occupancy for residential uses only, without the installation of the plant and tree components of the required landscaping, including right-of-way and street trees, and without the required watering of such landscaping, as needed. However, the landscaping requirements for grass and irrigation must be complied with as set forth in this chapter. The landscape architect on the project shall provide to the department of planning and zoning a good faith written estimate of the installed cost of the required landscaping not being provided on the property because of the restrictions. In order to assure the department of planning and zoning that the required landscaping shall be planted within 90 days after the emergency phase II or III water restrictions are ended by the district, a performance and payment bond in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of such landscaping shall be provided by the contractor or owner-builder to the department of planning and zoning prior to the issuance of any certificate of completion or certificate of use and occupancy. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "contractor" means any person, firm, joint venture or corporation indicated on the official permit records of the building division as the primary contractor and/or primary landscaping contractor for the project. An owner/builder is additionally considered to be a contractor. Additionally, the contract purchaser for any individual house or unit must covenant in writing that after the emergency phase II and III water restrictions are ended by the district, that such contract purchaser (who may then be an owner) will not interfere with or refuse to allow the installation of the required landscaping. 
(b)  The department of planning and zoning shall have the right to inspect the lands affected by this Land Development Code. 
(c)  Failure to install or maintain landscaping according to the terms of this chapter shall constitute a violation of this Land Development Code. Also, failure to plant, preserve, or maintain each individual tree shall be considered to be a separate violation of this Land Development Code. Each day in which either landscaping or individual trees are not installed or maintained according to the terms of this chapter shall constitute a continuing and separate violation of this Land Development Code. Further, failure by the current owner or the contractor to provide the required landscaping and watering of such landscaping within 90 days after the South Florida Water Management District ends the emergency phase II and III water restrictions shall constitute a violation of this Land Development Code.

The suspension and/or revocation may be enforced during the pendency of any administrative hearing before the special magistrate. A hearing shall be scheduled for the next most proximate hearing session before the special magistrate, unless mutually agreed upon otherwise by the licensee and the city manager in writing. At the hearing, the licensee and all other individuals wishing to speak will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so. The special magistrate may consider the matter de novo, and will determine whether the licensee violated a condition of the license or whether the licensee is operating in a manner harmful to the public health, safety or welfare based upon the criteria specified above as appropriate. If the special magistrate so finds, it may suspend, revoke, or otherwise impose additional conditions and/or restrictions upon the license or licensee. All decisions by the special magistrate in this regard are final.

Article XVII. - WORKFORCE HOUSING 

Sec. 74-886. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is recognized that a shortage of workforce housing exists in the City of Doral which is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. The current housing stock in the city is not affordable to many workers in Doral and thus they are forced to live in other areas of Miami-Dade County, and commute into and out of Doral. The purpose of this regulation is to provide a Workforce Housing Density Bonus (WHDB) to property owners with land located in certain land use categories for the planning and construction of housing affordable to workers in the City of Doral. 
(Ord. No. 2016-13 , § 2, 6-22-2016) 
Sec. 74-887. - Definitions. 
(a)  Area median income (AMI). The median income for the metropolitan statistical area containing Miami-Dade County which is adjusted for the household size as calculated and published annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
(b)  Eligible workforce household. A household with an annual income in the workforce affordability range between 65 percent and 140 percent of the applicable AMI figure. 
(c)  Workforce housing density bonus (WHDB). A bonus provision provided in selected land use categories contained in the city's adopted comprehensive plan in terms of an additional housing density bonus percentage of up to 30 percent above the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in the land use category, including the Creative Excellence density bonus, in return for the provision of two-thirds of the bonus units to be affordable to area workforce households. For example, if a development is proposing to build 100 dwelling units and is granted a 30 percent WHDB, the total number of units allowed would increase to 130, and 20 of the additional 30 units would be required to be affordable to the local workforce. This example is not intended and does not constitute a part of this division but is included herein for explanation and clarification purposes only. 
(d)  Workforce housing density bonus agreement. A written agreement between an applicant for a development and the city containing specific requirements to ensure the continuing affordability of the workforce housing units included in a development during the control period. 
(e)  Workforce housing unit. A rental dwelling unit occupied by an eligible workforce household where the maximum monthly rental cost shall be restricted to an amount affordable to a workforce household with a total annual income between 65 percent and 140 percent of AMI. 
(Ord. No. 2016-13 , § 2, 6-22-2016) 
Sec. 74-888. - Density bonus requirements. 
(a)  Workforce unit rental rates must be affordable to households in a relatively balanced distribution across the AMI affordability range as follows: One-third of the units must be affordable to workforce households making an annual income equal to 65 percent to 90 percent of AMI; one-third affordable to households making 91 percent to 115 percent of AMI; and one-third affordable to households making 116 percent to 140 percent of AMI. 
(b)  Prior to the initial rental of any workforce unit, the owner must record the WHDB Agreement in the chain of title for that unit, at no cost to the city, and submit recordation documentation to the city. The rental contract for the unit must also contain a clause summarizing the workforce housing requirements and rent level control, and referencing the recorded WHDB Agreement. 
(c)  The maximum rental rates for workforce units shall not exceed the affordability limit of an eligible workforce household making an annual income within the applicable AMI range pursuant to this division as published annually by the City of Doral based on official information available from documented sources such as Miami-Dade County and/or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
(d)  Where these regulations result in a fraction, the result shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
(Ord. No. 2016-13 , § 2, 6-22-2016) 
Sec. 74-889. - Application of workforce housing density bonus. 
(a)  Any development proposing to utilize the density bonus allowed in a land use category must submit a WHDB zoning application to the city for consideration and approval by the city council for approval. At a minimum, the application shall include: 
(1)  General description of the development including location, size, land use, zoning, and the number of rental units and/or for sale units the development will contain; 
(2)  Conceptual development plan showing the proposed location of the workforce housing rental units; 
(3)  Total number of market rate and WHDB units; 
(4)  Estimated initial monthly rent for each WHDB unit; 
(5)  Property legal description and survey; 
(6)  Affirmative written statement that the proposed project will be designed to meet the city's creative excellence standards in Code section 86-83, as amended. 
(7)  Any other relevant information requested by the planning and zoning director, or his/her designee. 
(b)  If a WHDB is approved by the city council, the property owner must also submit for site plan review and approval pursuant to this Code. In addition, to the site development plan requirements contained in chapter 53, article VIII, the following additional items must be submitted: 
(1)  For workforce each unit, provide the size in terms of square feet and number of bedrooms; 
(2)  Location in development of each workforce unit and its applicable AMI affordability range; 
(3)  If construction is to be phased, a phasing plan identifying the number of workforce units and market-rate units in each phase; and 
(4)  Documentation and plans regarding the interior and exterior appearances, materials, and finishes of the bonus units if not exactly the same as the market-rate units. 
(c)  The city council shall utilize the standards below in determining the level of WHDB to award to a prospective development. As a guideline, each standard below is considered to have a value of up to 6 percent of the total WHDB of 30 percent:

Chapter 80 - SIGN REGULATIONS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 80-1. - Short title and applicability. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Sign Code of City of Doral, Florida" and shall be applicable in the entire city. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. X, § 10-1), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 80-2. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. This sign ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance. Specifically, the city council finds that: 
(1)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment. 
(2)  An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public. 
(3)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic control signs and devices. 
(4)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information, thereby defeating the purpose of signage and creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians. 
(5)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation and permanent economic growth. 
(6)  Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well being of the City of Doral will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
(7)  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The mayor and council intend by enacting this chapter to: 
a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
b.  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
c.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city; 
d.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
e.  Maintain the city's image as one of excellence; 
f.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
g.  Promote economic development; and 
h.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(2)  While specifically establishing regulations to control signs within the city, it is not the intent of this chapter: 
a.  To regulate art and art symbols; or 
b.  Holiday decorations and symbols. 
(3)  Recognizing the need for certain types of signs which facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic, this chapter provides for the regulation of incidental address identification and subdivision identification signs. 
(4)  Recognizing the historical contribution of certain structures and places to the cultural fabric of the city and the need and desire to identify same, certain provisions are made in this chapter to allow for the identification of those structures and places. 
(5)  While this chapter prohibits certain signs from placement within the city and exempts certain signs from certain regulations of this chapter, such exemptions are not intended to otherwise allow a sign that is prohibited. 
(6)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city. 
(7)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this chapter.

By definition, the independent land surveying firm shall not be the same as the land surveyor recording the plat, so as to prevent any conflict of interest. Municipalities without a plat division may request the city's plat division to review both tentative and final plats, in which case the subdivider shall pay the same fees to the city as a subdivider within the unincorporated areas of the city would pay.

(3)  The resubdivision of land heretofore divided or platted into lots, sites or parcels. 
    Tentative plat means a preliminary map, drawing or chart indicating the proposed layout of the subdivision submitted for approval. Said preliminary map, drawing or chart shall not be considered a boundary survey as defined in F.A.C. ch. 21HH-6, as same may be amended from time to time.

(3)  The prevention of traffic hazards and the provisions of safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation in land developments. 
(4)  The provision of public open spaces in land developments for recreational and educational purposes. 
(b)  This chapter is intended to aid in the coordination of land development in the community in accordance with orderly physical patterns and to implement the master plan, or parts, thereof, and such zoning regulations and other measures in furtherance of such master plan as may have been or may hereafter be adopted. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-2)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-3. - Application of chapter. 
(a)  This chapter shall apply to and be enforced in both the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the city. 
(b)  No person, firm, corporation or any other association, shall create a subdivision of a tract of land anywhere in the city except in conformity with this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-3)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-4. - Plats and platting-Recording; exceptions. 
    Whenever land is subdivided a plat must be recorded, except that the recording of a plat will not be required if: 
(1)  The subdivision involved consists only of the dedication of a road, highway, street, alley or easement and due to unusual conditions and circumstances the plat division of the appropriate authority finds that it is not necessary that a plat be recorded. In lieu of the recording of a plat, the dedication may be required by deed, and may be subject to compliance with such conditions as may be deemed appropriate under the particular circumstances, such as improvements of sidewalks, streets, or drainage facilities and the acceptance of the dedication by the city council. Posting of bond may be required. 
(2)  The land to be subdivided is to be divided into no more than six parcels and because of: 
a.  Unusual conditions created by ownership or development of adjacent lands; 
b.  The isolation or remoteness of the land concerned in relation to other platted or improved lands; or 
c.  Improvements and dedications existing on the land substantially in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it is determined by the plat division of the appropriate authority that waiving of the requirement for platting would not conflict with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
In lieu of platting the plat division of the appropriate authority may require any dedications, reservations, or improvements required in connection with platting under this chapter, including the posting of a performance and maintenance bond, as may be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(3)  The resubdivision of land heretofore platted is of such unusual size or shape, or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions as may be determined by the plat division of the appropriate authority to justify the waiving of the requirement for recording a plat. In lieu of the recording of a plat, such conditions may be imposed as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to preserve the public interest. 
(4)  A parcel of land conveyed by a recorded warranty deed that is dated prior to January 1, 1958, the effective date of the county ordinance from which this chapter is derived; provided, however, that the parcel may be diminished in size as a result of a public dedication of any portion of that parcel. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-4)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-5. - Same-Procedure for waiver of plat. 
(a)  To determine if the waiving of the requirement for platting would not conflict with the purpose and intent of this chapter, and the exceptions contained in section 83-4 are applicable, a waiver of plat survey shall be submitted by the property owner. 
(b)  A waiver of plat application shall be submitted, signed by the owner and notarized on the form prescribed by the plat division of the appropriate authority. 
(c)  The waiver of plat survey shall be prepared by a land surveyor registered in the state and shall bear the embossed seal of the land surveyor. 
(d)  The waiver of plat survey shall include the following items, unless waived by the plat division of the appropriate authority: 
(1)  Legal description of the parent tract. 
(2)  Legal description of each parcel to be created. 
(3)  Location of property lines, existing easements, buildings, watercourses and other essential features. 
(4)  The location of any existing sewers and water mains, or any underground or overhead utilities, culverts and drains on the property to be subdivided. 
(5)  Location, names and present widths of existing and proposed streets, highways, easements, building lines, alleys, parks and other open public spaces and similar facts regarding property immediately adjacent. 
(6)  Date of field survey, north point and graphic scale. 
(7)  The width and location of all streets or other public ways proposed by the developer. 
(8)  The proposed lot lines with dimensions.

(10)  Existing easements or restrictions shown on underlying plat shall be shown. 
(11)  The location of all buildings, swimming pools, slabs, fences and other permanent structures on the adjacent properties that would be nonconforming with the creation of this division of land. 
(e)  The property owner shall pay such fees as may be prescribed for checking the waiver of plat and investigating such matters concerning it as may be required. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-4.1)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-6. - Same-Administrative prohibition of action on or approval of tentative plats and waivers of plats in the unincorporated county and vested rights procedure. 
(a)  Administrative prohibition of action on or approval of tentative plats and waiver of plats. 
(1)  Whenever any zoning hearing for a district boundary change within the unincorporated area is initiated by the director of the department of planning and zoning, the city manager may order that no tentative plat or waiver of plat, pertaining to any or all property involved in the application shall be acted upon or approved until the hearing upon said application has been finally concluded in accordance with the provisions of this Land Development Code. No such order shall be issued unless the city manager first determines that the processing and approval of tentative plats and waiver of plats would create a risk of land use contrary to the zoning which is most appropriate for the area. Said order shall not prevent processing and approval of a tentative plat or waiver of plat which would be permissible if the director's application were granted. 
(2)  Should the city manager issue an order pursuant to this section, administrative personnel shall schedule the zoning application for the first public hearing date after appropriate legal notice. The manager's order shall expire upon final action upon the zoning application. If the application for zoning change is not decided at the hearing for which it is first scheduled, the city council shall at said time decide whether the manager's order shall remain in effect and the board shall review the continued effectiveness of the order at any subsequent hearing to which the application is deferred and not decided. 
(b)  Vested rights. 
(1)  Any property owner claiming a vested right to obtain action upon or approval of a tentative plat or waiver of plat contrary to this section may submit an application for a determination of vested rights to the plat division. The application shall have attached an affidavit setting forth the facts upon which the applicant bases his claim for vested rights. The applicant shall also attach copies of any contracts, letters and other documents upon which a claim of vested rights is based. The mere existence of zoning shall not vest rights. 
(2)  The county plat division shall review the application and determine whether the applicant has demonstrated: 
a.  An act of development approval by an agency of the city; 
b.  Upon which the applicant has in good faith relied to his detriment; 
c.  Such that it would be highly inequitable to deny the landowner the right to obtain action on or approval of a tentative plat. 
(3)  Any appeal of the plat division's determination shall be made following the procedures outlined in section 83-9(f). 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection (b) of this section shall not prohibit the city council from considering the issue of vested rights during other hearings where such rights are in issue, provided that a decision upon a claim of such rights shall be a final determination thereof and further administrative hearings thereon shall be neither required nor permitted. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-4.2)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-7. - Same-Approval before recording. 
    No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to record in the office of the clerk of the circuit court until it shall have been approved in the manner prescribed herein.

(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-5)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-8. - Same-Revising plat after approval. 
(a)  Any changes, erasures, modifications or revisions to an approved plat prior to recordation may only be made by the plat division to correct scriveners errors, reflect accurate legal descriptions and locate right-of-way dedications, drainage ways and easements. 
(b)  No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions to an approved plat prior to recordation shall be made unless resubmitted for new approval; provided, however, that the city council may, after public hearing and based only upon a recommendation of its plat division, change, modify or revise dedicated road rights-of-way or drainage easements. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, exh. A(ch. XII, § 1(28-6)), 8-22-2007) 
Sec. 83-9. - Same-Procedure for platting.

The terms "town," "city," "village" or any other term suggesting a municipal corporation, shall not appear in the title or name of any plat which includes any property in the unincorporated area. The plat division of the appropriate authority shall disapprove any name or title which he may find to be sufficiently similar to the name of any existing town, city, village or municipal corporation, or the name similar to any previously approved plat in the incorporated or unincorporated areas of the city which may cause confusion as to the status or the location of any platted property. 
(2)  Deed description. Description written on map or plat. There shall be written or printed upon the plat a full and detailed description of the land embraced in the map or plat showing the township and range in which such lands are situated and the section and part of sections platted and a location sketch showing the plat's location in reference to the closest centers of each section embraced within the plat.

(6)  Clerk's fees for recording the plat. 
(7)  On plats within municipalities certification from the appropriate agency shall be submitted to the city's plat division certifying that all required improvements within the public right-of-way have been completed or that the city is holding sufficient bond for the completion of the improvements. The certification shall also state that the plat appears to conform to all of the requirements of this chapter. The city's plat division shall review certification from the appropriate agency within 45 days of the acknowledged receipt of the plats. Failure of the city to act on said plats within 45 days of the acknowledged receipt of the plat shall be deemed an approval of the plat. 
(8)  No plat shall be entitled for recording in the clerk's office until the plat is signed by the director of the county department of public works, certifying that the plat appears to conform to all of the requirements of this chapter. A certification of the director of the county department of public works need not appear if the plat division of the appropriate authority submits an affidavit to the clerk stating that the city has not acted on said plat within 45 days of the acknowledged receipt of the subject plat.

Upon the director of public work's determination that the pumphouse encroachment will not be contrary to the public interest the property owner shall execute and deliver a written covenant running with the land in favor of city committing that within 60 days after notice from the public works director that the pumphouse has become contrary to the public interest based on the criteria in this subsection, the property owner shall remove the pumphouse at the owner's expense and terminate the encroachment. 
(2)  Said covenant shall be in a form approved by the city attorney's office, and shall be executed so as to be entitled to recording in the public records of city. The property owner shall establish that there is no lien or encumbrance prior in right to such covenant except for nondelinquent ad valorem property taxes, failing which a removal bond satisfactory to the public works director shall additionally be posted. Upon the owner's compliance with the provisions of this section, the public works director shall issue written approval. 
(b)  For the purpose of this section, the term "drip irrigation" means low volume irrigation as defined in section 32-8.2(c) of the Miami-Dade County Code, which is intended and designed to deliver water and nutrients to the root area of a plant in quantities matching evapotranspiration requirements as closely as possible, and at a rate close to what the soil will absorb. 
(c)  Fences. 
(1)  Wire fences without barbed wire may be permitted to be constructed within the rights-of-way set forth in section 33-133 of the Miami-Dade County Code, providing written approval is obtained from the director of the public works department, and further providing that a building permit is secured for such fence placement. An applicant for the public works director's approval of a wire fence shall submit the written consents of all the owners of all parcels abutting the subject property, and of all the owners of all parcels immediately across the street from the subject site. In the event the applicant is unable to submit such consents, an application for nonuse variance may be filed pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c)(2) of this section and section 33-311 of the Miami-Dade County Code. Prior to consideration by the public works director, notice shall be mailed to all property owners within 1,000 feet of the property on which the fence is to be located if the property is situated wholly within the urban development boundary (as shown on the comprehensive development master plan), and to all property owners within 1,500 feet of such property, if any portion of such property is outside the urban development boundary. The notice shall state that any interested party may respond in writing within 30 days and that no permit will be granted until after the 30-day period has expired. After considering the application and all statements of interested parties, the public works director shall determine whether the requested fence will be contrary to the public interest based upon the following criteria: 
a.  Location of existing pavement, if any; 
b.  Safe sight distance for motorists; 
c.  Effect on adjacent land uses; 
d.  Access to land in the area; and 
e.  Safe recovery zone for vehicles. 
Under no circumstances shall any fence or wall be placed within the public right-of-way less than ten feet from the edge of any existing roadway pavement. Upon the public works director's determination that the fence will not be contrary to the public interest, the property owner shall execute and deliver a written covenant running with the land in favor of city committing that within 60 days after notice from the public works director that the fence has become inconsistent with the public interest based on the above-mentioned criteria the property owner shall remove the fence at the owner's expense. Said covenant shall be in a form approved by the city attorney's office, and shall be executed so as to be entitled to recording in the public records of city. The property owner shall establish that there is no lien or encumbrance prior in right to such covenant except for nondelinquent ad valorem property taxes, failing which a removal bond satisfactory to the public works director shall additionally be posted. 
(2)  The director shall publish notice of his determination regarding fence placement or removal in a newspaper of general circulation and shall provide mail notice to the same property owners who were entitled to be mailed notice in advance of the director's determination, as provided in this subsection. Appeal of the public works director's determination or decision shall be filed within 30 days of such publication or of the mailing of such notice, whichever date is later, and shall proceed as provided in subsection (d) of this section. The public interest criteria contained in this subsection shall apply to any appeal regarding the placement in or removal from the right-of-way of any wire fence. No masonry wall or wood fence shall be permitted to be constructed on or in a right-of-way unless approved as a nonuse variance pursuant to the provisions of section 33-311 of the Miami-Dade County Code. In addition to the criteria set forth in section 33-311(e)(2) of the Miami-Dade County Code, the public interest criteria contained in this subsection shall apply to any public hearing or appeal regarding the placement in or removal from the right-of-way of any masonry wall or wood fence. 
(d)  Appeals of the director's decision regarding pumphouse or fence placement or removal may be taken to the city council pursuant to section 53-464 of the City Code.

(a)  Authority of community zoning appeals board. The city council may authorize a variance from these regulations. The community zoning appeals board may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done, provided that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the overall community plan. In granting any variance, the city's community zoning appeals board shall prescribe any conditions that are deemed necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, the community zoning appeals board shall take into account among other things the nature of the proposed use of the land and the exiting use of the land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the city's community zoning appeals board finds, among other things, that all three of the following conditions exist in regard to the land concerned that: 
(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property and that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land. 
(2)  The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant. 
(3)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the other property in the territory in which the property is situated. 
(b)  Large scale developer. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the community zoning appeals board in the case of a plan and program for a new town or a complete community which in the judgment of the community zoning appeals board provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and achievement of the plan. 
(c)  Hearing and notice. All such variances shall be granted only after hearing and notice as prescribed in section 53-464 of the city Code. The city council shall not act without considering the recommendations of the planning director. 
(d)  Variance to specified sections. Where the use of a fire well or septic tank or both well and septic tank have been approved for use as provided in section 83-17(c)(2), (c)(3) and (d)(2), a variance to these sections need not be authorized by the community zoning appeals board.
