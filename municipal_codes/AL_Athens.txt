PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Athens, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through April 26, 1993, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Hamilton, City Clerk, Ms. Vicky Dowd, Mayor's Secretary, and Mr. E. Shane Black, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 6-31. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Athens Alcoholic Beverage Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2003-1451, art. 1, § I, 10-3-2003; Ord. No. 2005-1529, art. 1, § I, 5-9-2005) 
Sec. 6-32. - Purpose. 
    This article is enacted for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health and general welfare of the community, of establishing reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages, and of protecting and preserving certain areas, through reasonable consideration, among others, to the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to the congestion in the roads and streets, to a general view of promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining stability of neighborhoods and property values, and to the prevention of undesirable persons from engaging in or having any interest in alcoholic beverages. This article shall be construed as an exercise by the city of the police power of the state delegate to the city, in the regulation of traffic in alcoholic beverages within the city as provided by state law. 
    Additionally, with respect to those provisions in this article dealing with adult-oriented businesses, the city council makes the following findings: 
(1)  It is the purpose of such provisions to regulate such businesses so as to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the city's citizens. Such provisions have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation/restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials; and 
(2)  The council finds that: 
a.  Adult-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities; 
b.  Adult-oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both existing businesses and the surrounding residential areas, causing adverse secondary effects, including increased crime and downgrading of property values; 
c.  Adult-oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to crime, lower property values, urban blight and downgrading of the quality of life in the adjacent area; 
d.  The use of alcoholic beverages, in connection with the operation of an adult-oriented business, is an explosive combination that enhances and amplifies the negative secondary effects of adult-oriented businesses; 
e.  These findings raise substantial governmental concerns; and 
f.  Adult-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(Ord. No. 2003-1451, art. 1, § II, 10-3-2003; Ord. No. 2005-1529, art. 1, § II, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 2011-1790, § 1, 2-14-2011)

Sec. 6-71. - Applicability. 
    The application provisions of this article shall apply where the consent and approval of the city council is required for an alcoholic beverage license. In all other cases related to alcoholic beverage sales, the application provisions of this article shall apply in connection with the City's determination of whether the proposed location or operation with respect to the alcoholic beverage sales is prohibited by municipal ordinance and with respect to any related city recommendation to the state alcoholic beverage control board. 
(Ord. No. 2003-1451, art. II, § I, 10-3-2003; Ord. No. 2005-1529, art. II, § I, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 2011-1790, § 13, 2-14-2011) 
Sec. 6-72. - Required; transfer, suspension; display. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to have in such person's possession any alcoholic beverages within the city for the purpose of sale, or to sell, or keep for sale, or offer for sale, any alcoholic beverages, without having first procured a license and a business license. Licenses relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages may not be assigned or transferred. The city is hereby authorized to allow the address for the business licensed premises to be changed from one place to another within the city, as the city may determine appropriate; but shall not allow the sale of alcoholic beverages at a place for which the license could not originally have been issued lawfully. 
(b)  In the event of a change of ownership of a licensed establishment, the current licensee and buyer shall be required to complete the "City of Athens Transfer Request Alcoholic Beverage License" form with the city clerk-treasurer indicating this occurrence prior to either completing the sale of the licensed business, or relinquishing management or financial control of the business operation, whichever occurs first. The buyer and seller must also complete a transfer agreement with the state alcoholic beverage control board prior to or the day of the sale of the business; and additionally, the party to whom the licensed establishment is to be sold must file with the city a complete application city license within 30 days of notification to the city of the intent to sell, transfer, or assign the establishment. Upon request of the city clerk-treasurer, or designated representative, any applicant may be requested to produce records of the business or the transaction surrounding the sale of the business to determine the parties involved or the effective date of the transaction. These records include, but are not limited to, lease agreements, land sale agreements, bank statements, stock transfers, minutes of corporate board meetings, and/or purchase invoices. Any failure to produce the requested records, or a determination by the city that the transaction is not in compliance with the requirements specified herein will result in an immediate forfeiture of the city license upon notification of this determination and an opportunity for a public hearing by the city council. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to sell alcoholic beverages, and the city's consent and approval for such sale shall be deemed to expire, terminate, or otherwise be void when there is a substantial change in ownership in a licensed establishment, or when a licensed establishment is leased, rented, or abandoned, or when possession is otherwise surrendered to another party. Provided, however, that an applicant for a new license at a currently licensed establishment may be allowed to operate the establishment for a period not to exceed 60 days if said applicant is in compliance with subsection (b). In such case, the original licensee shall continue to be responsible for the conduct, operation and city tax liabilities of the establishment until such time as the city, in the new licensee's name, issues its approval. 
(d)  Upon the death of an individual licensee, sale of the licensed establishment, or temporary closing of the licensed establishment for a period in excess of 30 days, it shall be unlawful to sell alcoholic beverages, and the city's consent and approval for such sale shall be suspended, pending the reopening of the business. In the event the temporary closing is due to any renovation, remodeling, or repair to the licensed premises, the licensee shall provide written evidence of compliance with applicable building, fire, and health codes to the city clerk-treasurer, or designated representative, prior to the release of the license. 
(e)  For the purposes of this section, and to assist in defining a substantial change in ownership, the sale or transfer of 25 percent or more of a corporation's stock shall constitute a substantial change in ownership of the licensee. 
(f)  The city shall have the right to revoke any business license issued by the city for any violation of this article or the state alcoholic beverage control board rules and regulations, after notice and opportunity for a hearing before the city council. 
(g)  Every business license issued by the city to conduct normal and routine business and license issued by the state alcoholic beverage control board shall be conspicuously and constantly exposed under a transparent substance in an area visible to the general public on the licensed premises. 
(h)  Each business that changes its name shall provide the city clerk-treasurer the new information within 30 days of the name change.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 14-61. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council, of City of Athens, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 1(§ A), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-62. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 1(§ B), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-63. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 1(§ C), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-64. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(l)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 14-80. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 2(§ A), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-81. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated September 28, 1979, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Limestone County are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in the FIS. 
    When preliminary flood insurance studies and flood insurance rate maps have been provided by FEMA to the city: 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD) by FEMA, the use of the preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or floodway widths in the effective flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to revision through valid appeals. 
(2)  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD) by FEMA, the revised flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously effective flood hazard data provided by FEMA for the purposes of administrating these regulations. 
Where adopted regulatory standards conflict, the more stringent base flood elevation shall prevail. Preliminary FIS data may be subject to change by a valid appeal. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 2(§ B), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-82. - Establishment of a floodplain development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities in identified areas of special flood hazard and community flood hazard areas within the community.

Sec. 14-84. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 2(§ E), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-85. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 2(§ F), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-86. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 14-87. - Penalties for violation. 
(a)  Notice of violation. If the community determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, or the provisions of this article, it shall issue a written notice of violation, by certified return receipt mail, to such applicant or other responsible person. Where the person is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured a permit, the notice shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
(2)  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the permit or this article and the date for the completion of such remedial action; 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; and 
(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the community by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days after the notice of violation (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24-hour notice shall be sufficient). 
(b)  Additional enforcement actions. If the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one or more of the following enforcement actions may be enacted against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed. Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the city shall first notify the applicant or other responsible person in writing of its intended action. The city shall provide reasonable opportunity, of not less than ten days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24-hour notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the city may take or impose any one or more of the following enforcement actions or penalties: 
(1)  Stop work order. The community may issue a stop work order, which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations. 
(2)  Termination of water service and/or withhold or revoke certificate of occupancy. The community may terminate utilities and/or refuse to issue and/or revoke a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements and/or repairs conducted or being conducted on the site until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein. 
(3)  Suspension, revocation, or modifications of permit. The community may suspend, revoke, or modify the permit authorizing the development project. A suspended, revoked, or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the community may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
(4)  Civil penalties. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(5)  Section 1316 declaration. Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act authorizes FEMA to deny flood insurance to a property declared by the state, county, or municipal government to be in violation of the local floodplain management ordinance. A Section 1316 declaration shall be used when all other legal means to remedy a violation have been exhausted and the structure is noncompliant. Once invoked, the property's flood insurance coverage will be terminated and no new or renewal policy can be issued, no flood insurance claim can be paid on any policy on the property, and disaster assistance will be denied. 
The declaration must be in writing (letter or citation), from the community to the property owner and the applicable FEMA regional office, and must contain the following items: 
a.  The name(s) of the property owner(s) and address or legal description of the property sufficient to confirm its identity and location; 
b.  A clear and unequivocal declaration that the property is in violation of a cited state or local law, regulation or ordinance; 
c.  A clear statement that the public body making the declaration has authority to do so and a citation to that authority; 
d.  Evidence that the property owner has been provided notice of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance; and 
e.  A clear statement that the declaration is being submitted pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. 
If a structure that has received a Section 1316 declaration is made compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance, then the Section 1316 declaration can be rescinded by the community and flood insurance eligibility restored. 
(c)  Administrative appeal; judicial review. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the community, including but not limited to the issuance of a stop work order, the assessment of an administratively-imposed monetary penalty, the suspension, revocation, modification, or grant with condition of a permit by the community upon finding that the holder is in violation of permit conditions, or that the holder is in violation of any applicable ordinance or any of the community's rules and regulations, or the issuance of a notice of bond forfeiture. 
    The notice of appeal must be in writing and must be received within ten days from the date of the notice of violation. A hearing on the appeal shall take place within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal by the floodplain administrator. 
(d)  All appeals shall be heard and decided by the community's designated appeal board, which shall be board of zoning adjustment, or their designees. The appeal board shall have the power to affirm, modify, or reject the original penalty, including the right to increase or decrease the amount of any monetary penalty and the right to add or delete remedial actions required for correction of the violation and compliance with the community's flood damage prevention ordinance, and any other applicable local, state, or federal requirements.

Sec. 14-101. - Permit procedures. 
    Application for a development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by the community prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the elevations of the area in question and the nature, location, dimensions, of existing or proposed structures, fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and drainage facilities. 
    Specifically, the following procedures and information are required for all projects in the special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of city: 
(a)  Application stage. Plot plans are to include: 
(1)  The base flood elevation (BFE) where provided as set forth in section 14-81, section 14-117, or section 14-133; 
(2)  Boundary of the special flood hazard area and floodway(s) as delineated on the FIRM or other flood map as determined in section 14-81; 
(3)  Flood zone designation of the proposed development area as determined on the FIRM or other flood map as determined in section 14-81; 
(4)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the regulatory lowest floor level, including basement, of all proposed structures; 
(5)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure will be flood proofed; 
(6)  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed non-residential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria of sections 14-116(2) and 14-119(2); 
(7)  A foundation plan, drawn to scale, that shall include details of the proposed foundation system to ensure all provisions of this article are met. These details include, but are not limited to, the proposed method of elevation (i.e., fill, solid foundation perimeter wall, solid backfilled foundation, open foundation on columns/posts/piers/piles/shear walls) and description of any flood openings required in accordance with sections 14-116(1), 14-116(3), 14-118(7), and 14-119(1) when solid foundation perimeter walls are used. 
(8)  Usage details of any enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall be described. 
(9)  Plans and/or details for the protection of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems to be located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(10)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development including current and proposed locations of the watercourse. An engineering report shall be provided on the effects of the proposed project on the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse and the effects to properties located both upstream and downstream. The affected properties shall be depicted on a map or on the plot plan. 
(11)  Certification of the plot plan by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor in the state of Alabama is required. 
(b)  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the floodplain administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level using appropriate FEMA elevation or floodproofing certificate immediately after the lowest floor or flood proofing is completed. When flood proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
    Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the above-referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
    As the work pursuant to a floodplain development permit progresses, the floodplain administrator shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary 
    The floodplain administrator shall make periodic inspections of projects during construction throughout the special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the community to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. Members of his or her inspections/engineering department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action. 
    The floodplain administrator may revoke and require the return of the floodplain development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing stating the reason(s) for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, and specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any floodplain development permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked. 
    In any lot or lots/areas that will be or have been removed from the special flood hazard area utilizing a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F), the top of fill level must meet the community's freeboard elevation at that location. If the top of fill level is below the freeboard elevation, all new structures, additions to existing buildings or substantial improvement must meet the required community freeboard elevation. 
(c)  Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, a FEMA elevation certificate (FEMA Form 81-31), which depicts all finished construction elevations, is required to be submitted to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the project includes a floodproofing measure, a FEMA floodproofing certificate is required to be submitted by the permit holder to the floodplain administrator. 
    The floodplain administrator shall review the certificate(s) data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance. In some instances, another certification may be required to certify corrected as-built construction. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy. 
    Documentation regarding completion and compliance with the requirements stated in the permit application and with section 14-101(a) shall be provided to the local floodplain administrator at the completion of construction or records shall be maintained throughout the construction stage by inspectors for the floodplain administrator. Failure to provide the required documentation shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a certificate of compliance/occupancy. 
    All records that pertain to the administration of this article shall be maintained and made available for public inspection, recognizing that such information may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended.

(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non- conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(11)  Proposed new construction and substantial improvements that are partially located in an area of special flood hazard shall have the entire structure meet the standards for new construction. 
(12)  Proposed new construction and substantial improvements that are located in multiple flood hazard risk zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations shall have the entire structure meet the standards for the most hazardous flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 4(§ A), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-116. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with engineered or estimated base flood elevation), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential and non-residential structures. Where base flood elevation data is available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 14-116(3). 
(2)  Non-residential structures. New construction and substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 14-102(6). 
(3)  Enclosures for elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area below the base flood elevation, located below the lowest floor formed by the foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding (if a structure has more than one enclosed area below the base flood elevation, each shall have openings on exterior walls); 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves and other coverings and devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. All interior walls, ceilings and floors below the base flood elevation shall be unfinished and/or constructed of flood resistant materials. 
d.  Mechanical, electrical or plumbing devices shall not be installed below the base flood elevation. The interior portion of such enclosed area(s) shall be void of utilities except for essential lighting and power as required. 
e.  Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will violate the requirements for enclosures below the base flood elevation. Periodic inspections will be conducted by the floodplain administrator to ensure compliance. 
(4)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: 
1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet) above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 14-116, provisions (3)a. and (3)c. 
(5)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the city FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(6)  Accessory structures (also referred to as appurtenant structures). This provision generally applies to new and substantially improved accessory structures. When an accessory structure complies with all other provisions of this article (including floodway encroachment), represents a minimal investment (less than $1,000.00), and meets the requirements outlined below, these structures may be wet-floodproofed and do not have to be elevated or dry floodproofed. 
Accessory structures include, but are not limited to, residential structures such as detached garages, storage sheds for garden tools or woodworking, gazebos, picnic pavilions, boathouses, small pole barns, and similar buildings. The following provisions apply to accessory structures built below the base flood elevation: 
a.  A permit shall be required prior to construction or installation. 
b.  Must be low value (less than $1,000.00) and not be used for human habitation. 
c.  Use must be restricted to parking of personal vehicles or limited storage (low-cost items that cannot be conveniently stored in the principal structure). 
d.  Must be designed with an unfinished interior and constructed with flood damage-resistant materials below the BFE. 
e.  Must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. 
f.  Must have adequate flood openings as described in section 14-115(5) and be designed to otherwise have low flood damage potential. 
g.  Shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. 
h.  Any mechanical and other utility equipment in the structure must be elevated to or above the BFE or must be floodproofed. 
i.  Under limited circumstances communities may issue variances to permit construction of wet-floodproofed accessory structures. Communities should not grant variances to entire subdivisions for accessory structures, especially detached garages. Variances should only be reviewed and issued on an individual or case-by-case basis and be based on the unique characteristics of the site. 
j.  If located in a V zone, the structure must be elevated on posts, piles, piers, or columns; consistent with all V zone building standards. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 4(§ B), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-117. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-81, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of FEMA; 
(4)  Only if section 14-117, provisions (1) through (3) are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 4(§ C), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-118. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-81, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(2)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 14-81 then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then section 14-118, provisions (5) and (6) shall apply: 
(3)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

Sec. 14-119. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-81 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) plus one foot of freeboard. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 14-116(3). 
The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified flood level in section 14-119(1) or three feet (if no depth number is specified), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.

(e)  All subdivision and other development proposals which involve disturbing more than 5,000 square feet of land shall include a stormwater management plan which is designed to limit peak runoff from the site to predevelopment levels for the one, ten, and 100-year rainfall event. These plans shall be designed to limit adverse impacts to downstream channels and floodplains. Single residential lots involving less than one acre of land disturbance are not subject to this regulation. 
(f)  All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(g)  All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the special flood hazard area, the floodway boundary, and the base flood elevations.

Sec. 14-121. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one percent annual chance floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA only if no feasible alternative site is available and access to the facilities remains available during a 0.2 percent chance flood. 
(1)  Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above the base flood elevation at the site (or to the 0.2 percent chance flood elevation whichever is greater). 
(2)  Floodproofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that any and all on-site toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. 
(3)  Multiple access routes, elevated to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. 
(4)  Critical facilities must be protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood and must remain operable during such an event.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 14-130. - Designation of variance and appeals board. 
    The board of zoning adjustment as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 5(§ A), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-131. - Duties of board. 
    The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court or court of like jurisdiction, as provided in Code of Alabama 1975. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 5(§ B), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-132. - Variance procedures. 
    In reviewing requests for variance, the zoning board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood, and it creates no additional threats to public safety. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners. 
(4)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions. 
(5)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage including materials that may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
(6)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community. 
(7)  The safety of access to the property during flood conditions for daily traffic and emergency vehicles. 
(8)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(9)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(10)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development based on the community's comprehensive plan for that area. 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
(12)  The costs associated with providing governmental services to the development during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and community infrastructure such as streets, bridges, and culverts. 
Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this article, the zoning board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 5(§ C), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-133. - Variances for historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 5(§ D), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-134. - Conditions for variances. 
    The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(1)  In the instance of a historic structure, a determination is required that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(2)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
(Ord. No. 2018-2052, art. 5(§ E), 8-13-2018) 
Sec. 14-135. - Variance notification and records. 
    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  Specifies the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with an increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. It could result in rate increases in the hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars annually depending on structure and site specific conditions. 
(2)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions and appeal actions, including justification for their issuance. Report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region 4 and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(3)  A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the engineering services and community development department and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

DIVISION 6. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 14-140. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    A zone means the area of special flood hazard without base flood elevations determined. 
    A99 zone means that part of the special flood hazard area inundated by the one percent annual chance flood to be protected from the one percent chance flood by a federal flood protection system or levee under construction, no base flood elevations are determined. 
    Accessory structure (also referred to as appurtenant structures) means a structure which is located on the same parcel of property as a principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. They should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. These structures are used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low cost storage sheds). They are included under the general definition of structure and are consequently subject to all floodplain management regulations pertaining to structures. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any improvement that increases the square footage of a structure. These include lateral additions added to the front, side, or rear of a structure, vertical additions added on top of a structure, and enclosures added underneath a structure. NFIP regulations for new construction apply to any addition that is considered a perimeter expansion or enclosure beneath a structure. If it is considered to be a substantial improvement (more than 50 percent of market value) to a structure, the existing structure will also need to be treated as new construction. 
Depending on the flood zone and details of the project, the existing building may not have to be elevated. The determining factors are the common wall and what improvements are made to the existing structure. If the common wall is demolished as part of the project, then the entire structure must be elevated. If only a doorway is knocked through it and only minimal finishing is done, then only the addition has to be elevated. 
    AE zone means the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    AH zone means an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually shallow ponding), with base flood elevations shown. 
    AO zone means an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), with depth numbers shown. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the board of zoning adjustment interpretation of any provision of this article. 
    AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones means a flood zone that results from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard (also see "special flood hazard area") means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 14-81. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also referred to as the "one percent chance flood"). 
    Base flood elevation means the computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. It is also the elevation of surface water resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. Base flood elevations are shown in the FIS and on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30 and VE. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building (also see structure) means (1) A structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; or (2) a manufactured home (a "manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or (3) a travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
    Community means a political entity and/or its authorized agents or representatives that have the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Critical facility (aka, critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes and regulations). 
    D zone means an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam means any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a dam. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Dry floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of 12 inches above the base flood elevation (more is recommended). Dry floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the coastal high hazard area or the coastal AE zone. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, pilings, posts, columns, piers, or shear walls. 
    Elevation certificate means a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before September 24, 1979 (Ordinance 750) or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 24, 1979 (Ordinance 750). 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
c.  Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding as described in part "b." of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
d.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in part "a." of this definition. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been designated as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study/flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood protection elevation means the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus freeboard. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities or structures with their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above the base flood elevation (BFE) for purposes of floodplain management which tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. Used to determine the level for a building's lowest floor elevation or level of floodproofing required to be in compliance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facility that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding, and ship repair facilities. The term does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The board of zoning adjustment requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is; 
a.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register: 
b.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district: 
c.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
d.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
1.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or 
2.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) means an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: 
Letter of map amendment (LOMA). An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the point of the ground level immediately next to a building. This may be the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more section, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for the base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum. 
    National flood insurance program (NFIP) means the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 24, 1979 (Ordinance 750) and includes any subsequent improvements (including additions) to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after September 24, 1979 (Ordinance 750). 
    Non-residential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than six months duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (aka 100-year flood) means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26-percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community means any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation means an action taken by FEMA to formally notify participating communities of the first of the two NFIP sanctions due to their failure to correct violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:

c.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
d.  Has no attached deck, porch, or shed; 
e.  Has quick-disconnect sewage, water, and electrical connectors; 
f.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
g.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has completed a flood risk study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway. See floodway. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property means any insurable structure for which two or more claims of more than $1,000.00 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each other. A repetitive loss property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means no new flood insurance policy or federal disaster assistance shall be provided for any property which the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body, to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances which are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in floodprone areas. If the structure is made compliant with the applicable community's floodplain management ordinance, then the Section 1316 declaration can be rescinded by the community and flood insurance and disaster assistance eligibility restored. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
a.  Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000.00 each (including building and contents payments); or 
b.  Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means that portion of the floodplain subject to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, or VE. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)) means the date the development or building permit was issued (includes substantial improvement), provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
    "Permanent construction" does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a liquid or gas storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Suspension means the removal, with or without probation, of a participating community from the NFIP because the community failed to adopt and enforce the compliant floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §§ 44, 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means any flowing body of water including a river, creek, stream, or a branch. 
    Wet floodproofing means a method of construction which allows water to enter a structure in such a way that will minimize damage to the structure and its contents. Wet floodproofing is appropriate for functionally dependent use and uses that facilitate open space use by variance only, structures utilized for parking or limited storage, or when all other techniques are not technically feasible. Wet floodproofing shall not be utilized as a method to satisfy the requirements of this article for bringing substantially damaged or improved structures into compliance. Wet floodproofing is not allowed in lieu of complying with the lowest floor elevation requirements for new residential buildings. 
    X zones (shaded) are areas of 0.2 percent chance flood that are outside of the SFHA subject to the one percent chance flood with average depths of less than one foot, or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas protected by certified levees from the base flood. 
    X zones (unshaded) are areas determined to be outside the 0.2 percent chance floodplain. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or a flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

(Ord. No. 2013-1904, § 1, 12-23-2013) 
Sec. 22-5. - Sale and transfer of lots-Lot prices; nature of rights in lots; transfer of lots; perpetual care trust fund established. 
(a)  The cemetery department may make cemetery lots of the city open for sale to the general public. Upon sale, a purchaser will acquire a burial right (the right to use a grave space for the interment of human remains) in a cemetery lot of the city. Such right is not an absolute right of property, but is instead a privilege or a license, subject to the regulation and control of the city. 
(b)  Burial rights in cemetery lots shall be sold at a price of $2,400.00 per lot, and each lot shall consist of eight graves. Half-lots consisting of four graves shall be sold for $1,200.00. Quarter lots consisting of two graves shall be sold for $600.00. Burial rights in graves must be purchased in pairs or in even numbers. No rights in a single grave will be sold except that, in the event that a lot cannot be practically divided into eight graves or into an even number of graves, the cemetery department may, at its discretion, sell rights in one grave from said lot which contains an odd number of graves with said lot being sold for $300.00. 
(c)  The cemetery department may accept personal checks or money orders in payment for rights in a lot or portion thereof. The cemetery department shall not accept cash payments. 
(d)  The document from the city to the purchaser transferring a burial right(s) in a cemetery lot(s) (whether styled as a "deed," an "interment rights agreement", or otherwise) shall be issued by the mayor (or the director of the cemetery department) and shall be attested by the city clerk, who shall attach thereto the corporate seal. No burial rights in any lot or any portion thereof shall be sold until the purchase price is paid for the same. Such transfer document shall state, among other things, that the transfer is subject to such rules and regulations that the city may adopt for the regulation and control of its cemeteries, and that the city has the right, without legal proceedings or re-entry, to take possession of the lot and cancel the burial rights in the event that the transferee does not comply with the same. 
(e)  A burial right in a cemetery lot is transferable to other persons. Any owner who desires to transfer his/her burial right to another person shall execute a transfer document (whether styled as an "Agreement - Transfer Cemetery Property", "Interment Rights Assignment" or otherwise) on a form which may be obtained from the cemetery department. A copy of said properly executed transfer document shall be filed with the cemetery department. The fee associated with filing said transfer document shall be $5.00. Said transfer document shall contain and remain subject to the same provisions and restrictions contained in the original transfer document pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. A person claiming ownership of burial rights to the cemetery lot by transfer from the original owner must provide written proof to the cemetery department's satisfaction that the record owner of the rights to the cemetery lot transferred those rights to the person claiming ownership. 
(f)  If a person claims ownership of burial rights to a cemetery lot through inheritance, then the person claiming ownership of rights to the lot through inheritance must provide written proof to the satisfaction of the cemetery department that the person(s) claiming ownership of the rights is(are) the actual owner(s), through specific devise or inheritance. 
(g)  A right of burial in a cemetery lot, upon the death of the owner (or other transferee), passes to the heirs at law of the deceased owner as if he/she had died intestate. There is an exception to this rule if the deceased person left a specific devise of such right in his/her last will and testament, and in that event the right will be transferred as stated in the probated will. 
(h)  In cases where rights to a cemetery lot are owned by two or more persons, the cemetery department will handle interment requests on a first-come, first-served basis. Where rights to a cemetery lot are owned by two or more persons, the consent of all co-owners is not required for the interment of a co-owner or a member of the immediate family of a co-owner. However, the consent of all of the co-owners is required for the burial of a person who is neither a co-owner nor a member of the immediate family of one of the co-owners. For purposes of this subsection, members of an owner's "immediate family" include the owner's parents, spouse, children, and siblings. 
(i)  Any person claiming ownership of burial rights with respect to a cemetery lot through inheritance or specific devise must complete a form warranting to the cemetery department that the claimant is the actual owner, and promising to indemnify the city (and its officers and agents) from any and all claims arising from such claim of ownership. 
(j)  Twenty percent of the purchase price received by the cemetery department for the purchase of burial rights in cemetery lots, half-lots, or quarter-lots shall be place in a special trust fund and invested at the discretion of the city in interest bearing securities, which interest from said securities shall be used to maintain all lots purchased after December 14, 1965.

(b)  Any person owning any burial rights prior to December 14, 1965, shall have the privilege of paying $100.00 to the city for the perpetual care of said related cemetery lots and not be obligated to pay the annual upkeep as set out in subsection (a) of this section.

The cemetery department may determine whether or not to approve such permit, taking into account, among other things, whether the proposed improvement is detrimental or otherwise interferes with the adjacent lots or avenues, and whether it would interfere with the cemetery department's maintenance and control over the cemetery and its good order. 
(b)  Removal of dangerous improvements.

Sec. 46-161. - Procedure. 
(a)  Whenever litter, trash, and/or weeds or tall grass over 12 inches in height is found upon private property, the chief of police may declare the same to be a public nuisance and order that the nuisance be abated within five days. The neglect, refusal or failure to abate the nuisance within the five-day period shall result in a citation for the offender to appear before the municipal court. If the person shall fail to abate the nuisance within five days after the same is ordered by the municipal court judge, then the chief of police, his officers, his agents, his employees, or city jail inmates shall enter upon the premises and shall proceed with the abatement of the nuisance at the expense of the offender. 
(b)  The chief of police is hereby directed to keep an account of all costs and expenses, including administrative expenses, of abating a particular nuisance. The chief of police shall certify the account to the city council on a monthly basis. In certifying the account to the city council, the chief of police shall provide a report, which lists each and every separate piece of property where a public nuisance has been abated. This report shall contain a description of the premises, the name of the offender and the total amount of expenses incurred in abating the nuisance. If prisoners are employed in abating the nuisance, then a reasonable charge for their labor, including administrative costs, shall be included in the expenses to be charged against the offender. 
(c)  The city council shall set a time and place for the offender to appear and to show cause as to why the expenses incurred for the abatement of the public nuisance should not be assessed against them and/or their respective premises. Notice of this hearing shall be published at least ten days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At the time and place fixed for said hearing, the city council shall hear and consider all evidence, objections and protests against the assessment of expenses. Unless good cause is shown, the city shall proceed to levy an assessment against the offender for the cost of abating the public nuisance. If the assessment has been levied against the owner of the property, then the assessment shall also constitute a lien on said property. A copy of the assessment shall be turned over to the appropriate city official or employee who is charged with the collection of taxes or assessments. The amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure for foreclosure and sale in case of a delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. 
(d)  Any property owner shall have the right to have any such weeds and/or trash removed at his own expense providing the same is done prior to the commencing of work by the employees or agents of the city to do the same; provided, however, that the work performed satisfactorily abates the nuisance.

Sec. 50-32. - Rules and regulations. 
    The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted with respect to all service furnished by the electric department of the city: 
(1)  Application for service. Each prospective customer desiring electric service may be required to sign the city's standard form of application for service or contract before service is supplied by the city. 
(2)  Deposit. A deposit or suitable guarantee equal to approximately twice the average monthly bill may be required of any customer before electric service is supplied. The city may, at its option, return such deposit to any customer after one year. Upon termination of service, the deposit may be applied by the city against unpaid bills of the customer, and if any balance remains after such application is made, said balance shall be refunded to the customer. 
(3)  Point of delivery. The point of delivery is the point, as designated by the city, on the customer's premises where current is to be delivered to a building or premises. All wiring and equipment beyond this point of delivery shall be provided and maintained by the customer at no expense to the city. 
(4)  Inspections. The city shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to inspect any installation before electricity is introduced or at any later time, and reserves the right to reject any wiring or appliances not in accordance with the city's standards; but such inspection or failure to inspect or reject shall not render the city liable or responsible for any loss or damage resulting from defects in the installations, wiring, or appliances, or from violation of the city's rules, or from accidents which may occur upon the customer's premises. 
(5)  Underground service lines. Customers desiring underground service lines from the city's overhead system must bear the excess cost incident thereto. Specifications and terms for construction of such lines will be furnished by the city on request. 
(6)  Customer's responsibility for the city's property. All meters, service connections, and other equipment furnished by the city shall be, and remain, the property of the city. The customer shall provide a space for, and exercise proper care to protect, the property of the city on the customer's premises; and in the event of loss or damage to the city's property, arising from neglect of the customer to care for same, the cost of the necessary repairs and replacements shall be paid by the customer. 
(7)  Right of access. The city's identified employees shall have access to the customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading, testing, repairing, removing, or exchanging any or all equipment belonging to the city. 
(8)  Billing. Bills will be rendered monthly and shall be paid within 15 days from date of bill at the office of the city. Failure to receive a bill will not release the customer from the customer's obligation to make payment thereof. Should bills not be paid as above provided, the city may at any time thereafter, upon 30 days' written notice to the customer, discontinue service. Bills paid on or before the final date for payment shall be payable at the net rates, but thereafter the gross rates shall apply, all as provided in the present schedule of rates and charges for the electric department of the city, or as may be established from time to time by a schedule of rates and charges for the electric department of the city by the superintendent of utilities of the city. Should the final date of payment of the bill at the net rates fall on a Sunday or holiday, the business day next following the final date will be held as a day of grace for delivery of payment. Net remittances by mail after the time limit for payment of said net rates will be accepted by the city if the incoming envelope bears a United States post office date stamp of the final date for payment of the net amount or any date prior thereto. 
(9)  Discontinuance of service by the city. The city may refuse to connect or may discontinue service for the violation of any of its rules and regulations, or for violation of any of the provisions of the schedule of rates and charges, or of the application of the customer or contract with the customer. The city may discontinue service to the customer for the theft of current or the appearance of theft devices on the premises of the customer. The discontinuance of service by the city for any of the causes stated in this rule shall not release the customer from the customer's obligation to the city for the payment of minimum bills as specified in the application of the customer or the contract with the customer. 
(10)  Reconnection charge. Whenever service has been discontinued by the city, as provided above, or a trip is made by an employee of the city for the purpose of discontinuing service, a current permitted charge fixed by the city council, may be collected by the city before service is restored. 
(11)  Termination of contract by customer. Customers who have fulfilled their contract terms and wish to discontinue service must give at least three days' written notice to that effect, unless the service contract specifies otherwise. Notice to discontinue service prior to expiration of the contract term will not relieve the customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under any contract or rate. 
(12)  Service charges for temporary service. Customers requiring electric service on a temporary basis may be required by the city to pay all costs for connection and disconnection incidental to the supplying and removal of service. This rule applies to circuses, carnivals, fairs, temporary construction, and the like. 
(13)  Interruption of service. The city will use reasonable diligence in supplying current, but shall not be liable for breach of contract in the event of, or for loss, injury or damage to persons or property resulting from interruptions in service, excessive or inadequate voltage, single-phasing, or otherwise unsatisfactory service, whether or not caused by negligence. 
(14)  Voltage fluctuations caused by customer. Electric service must not be used in such a manner as to cause fluctuations or disturbances to the city's system. The city may require the customer, at the expense of the customer, to install suitable apparatus that will reasonably limit such fluctuations. 
(15)  Additional load. The service connection, transformers, meters, and equipment supplied by the city for each customer have definite capacity, and no addition to the equipment or load connected thereto will be allowed except by consent of the city. Failure to give notice of additions or changes in load, and to obtain the city's consent for same, shall render the customer liable for any damage to any of the city's lines or equipment caused by the additional or changed installation. 
(16)  Standby and resale service. All purchased electric service (other than emergency or standby service) used on the premises of the customer shall be supplied exclusively by the city, and the customer shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, sublet, assign, or otherwise dispose of the electric service or any part thereof. 
(17)  Notice of trouble. The customer shall notify the city immediately should the service be unsatisfactory for any reason, or should there be any defects, trouble, or accidents affecting the supply of electricity. Such notices, if verbal, should be confirmed in writing. 
(18)  Nonstandard service. The customer shall pay the cost of any special installation necessary to meet the customer's peculiar requirements for service at other than standard voltages, or for the supply of closer voltage regulation than required by standard practice. 
(19)  Meter tests. The city will, at its own expense, make periodic tests and inspections of its meters in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy. The city will make additional tests or inspections of its meters at the request of the customer. If tests made at the customer's request show that the meter is accurate within two percent, slow or fast, no adjustment will be made in the customer's bill, and the testing charge established by the council will be paid by the customer. In case the test shows the meter to be in excess of two percent fast or slow, an adjustment shall be made in the customer's bill for a period not exceeding 90 days prior to the date of such test, and the cost of making such test shall be borne by the city. 
(20)  Relocation of the outdoor lighting facilities. The city shall, at the request of the customer, relocate or change existing city-owned equipment. The customer shall reimburse the city for such changes at actual cost including appropriate overhead charges. 
(21)  Billing adjusted to standard periods. The demand charges and the blocks in the energy charges set forth in the rate schedules are based on billing periods of approximately one month. In the case of the first billing on new accounts (temporary service, cotton gins and other seasonal customers excepted) and final billings of all accounts (temporary service excepted) where the period covered by the billing involves fractions of a month, the demand charges and the blocks of the energy charge will be adjusted to a basis proportionate with the period of time during which service is extended. 
(22)  Scope. These rules and regulations are a part of all contracts for receiving electric service from the city, and apply to all service received from the city, whether the service is based upon contract, agreement, signed application, or otherwise. A copy of these rules and regulations, together with a copy of the city's schedule of rates and charges, shall be kept open to inspection at the offices of the city. 
(23)  Revisions. These rules and regulations may be revised, amended, supplemented, or otherwise changed from time to time, without notice. Such changes, when effective, shall have the same force as the present rules and regulations. 
(24)  Conflict. In case of conflict between any provision of any rate schedule and these rules and regulations, the rate schedule shall apply.

    In the event of an emergency or any other condition causing a shortage in the amount of electricity for the city, to meet the demand on its system, then the city may, by an allocation method deemed equitable by the utilities coordinator, fix the amount of electricity to be made available for use by any customer and/or may otherwise restrict the time during which any customer may make use of electricity as well as the uses which any customer may make of electricity. If such action becomes necessary, any customer may request a variance because of unusual circumstances, including matters adversely affecting the public health, safety and welfare.

(Ord. No. 2005-1552, arts. I-III, 9-12-2005; Ord. No. 2006-1666, § 1, 12-10-2007; Ord. No. 2014-1913, § 1, 5-1-2014) 
Sec. 50-79. - Excess capacity interruptible water service. 
(a)  The city may provide excess capacity interruptible water service to customers that are public utilities supplying water service to any area within the city. 
(b)  Such excess capacity interruptible water service will be provided from the city's capacity to furnish a supply of potable water that exists in excess of the real or anticipated demand for water service at any given time from all other regular, standard customers and obligations of the city. 
(c)  The rates for excess capacity interruptible water service shall be as follows: 
Gallons/Month Service from Low Pressure Transmission Mains Service from High Pressure Distribution Mains First 5,000,000 $1.55/1,000 $1.80/1,000 Next 10,000,000 $1.40/1,000 $1.55/1,000 Next 15,000,000 $1.25/1,000 $1.40/1,000 Next 60,000,000 $1.15/1,000 $1.30/1,000 All over 90,000,000 $1.05/1,000 N/A  
(d)  The dollar prices per 1,000 gallons in the preceding rate schedule shall increase 2.5 percent per annum on July 1 of each year (with the first such increase commencing on July 1, 2014). 
(e)  The city's provision of excess capacity interruptible water service anticipates and is subject to being limited, curtailed, interrupted, or halted at any or all delivery locations by the city's water and sewer department at any time, and there is no guarantee by the city or obligation of the city as to the amount or volume of the service available at any given time. The decision to limit, curtail, interrupt, or halt any such service is within the sole and absolute discretion of the water and sewer department. By way of example and not as a limitation, if the water and sewer department concludes that providing the excess capacity interruptible water service will interfere with the city's operations and supply with respect to any of its other water service, then the water and sewer department may limit or halt the excess capacity interruptible water service. 
(f)  The water and sewer department will give advance notice to the customer prior to limiting, curtailing, interrupting, or halting the excess capacity interruptible water service. The water and sewer department will give such notice in a manner and timeframe that it, in its sole discretion, deems reasonable and appropriate. 
(g)  Absent circumstances that the water and sewer department deems to be an emergency in which the water and sewer department will take action to enforce the limitation, curtailment, interruption, or halting of the excess capacity interruptible water service, the customer will adhere to and carry out the water and sewer department's direction to limit, curtail, interrupt, or halt such service through use of the customer's own operational system. However, if the customer continues to take unauthorized deliveries of water after the water and sewer department's direction to limit, curtail, interrupt, or halt the excess capacity interruptible water service, then the water and sewer department may immediately take action to limit or discontinue such deliveries to customer, and in such event, the city disclaims any responsibility for any damages or restitution related to or arising from any interruption of the excess capacity interruptible water service. 
(h)  The city will provide excess capacity interruptible water service from either low pressure transmission mains or high pressure distribution mains, as the same may be defined by the water and sewer department, at delivery point locations that are selected by the customer and acceptable to the water and sewer department.

Sec. 50-137. - Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards to reflect POTW removal of pollutants. 
    Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. The term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent. The amount shall be determined by the methods and procedures established and promulgated by ADEM and the EPA. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(Code 1983, § 12-76; Ord. No. 818, § 2.4, 7-13-1981) 
Sec. 50-138. - Variances from federal categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors. 
    Any interested person believing that factors relating to an industrial user are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a federal categorical pretreatment standard applicable to that user, and further that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit from that specified in the applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under the provisions of 40 CFR 403.13. This request must be made to ADEM within 90 days after promulgation by EPA of the categorical pretreatment standard and must conform with the requirements outlined in 40 CFR 403.13(e).

    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect the public health and welfare. 
(2)  Protect the natural and manmade drainageways of the city. 
(3)  Protect adjacent property owners from stormwater runoff from property being developed, excavated or filled. 
(4)  Protect the existing drainageways and prevent the blocking or impeding of the natural flow of stormwater from adjacent property. 
(5)  Reduce the impact on public and private property caused by the accumulation of mud, dirt, water, debris, and other construction materials. 
(Ord. No. 99-1315, § 1.1, 8-9-1999) 
Sec. 74-62. - Excavating, filling or grading of property. 
(a)  Any person who, or, firm or corporation which disturbs or causes the disturbance of the natural ground cover and causes a change in the natural ground elevation shall first submit to the city planning department a grading plan showing existing and proposed contours, drainage plan, and erosion control plan to be approved by the planning commission. 
(b)  Any person who disturbs the natural ground cover in an area for which there is an approved grading, drainage, and erosion control plan shall comply with the requirements of such plan without exception. 
(Ord. No. 99-1315, § 1.2, 8-9-1999) 
Sec. 74-63. - Standards. 
    To implement the objectives presented in section 74-61, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  The calculated peak rate of stormwater runoff resulting from the ten-year return period, 24-hour duration, type II storm distribution (as defined by the Soil Conservation Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture) shall be no greater after development of a site than before development of a site, if it cannot clearly be shown that the existing public drainageway has the capacity to sufficiently carry the additional stormwater runoff. (See section 74-64 for criteria for determining runoff.) 
(2)  No construction, whether by private or public action, shall be performed in such a manner as to materially increase the degree of flooding in its vicinity or in other areas whether by flow restrictions, increased runoff, or by diminishing channel or overbank storage capacity. 
(Ord. No. 99-1315, § 1.3, 8-9-1999) 
Sec. 74-64. - Criteria for determining runoff and designing waterway structures. 
(a)  For drainage areas of less than 1,000 acres, it is proposed that the rational formula be used to determine the peak rate of runoff of the stormwater that must be handled at a particular point. The formula is expressed as follows: 
Q = CIAK 
where: 
Q = Flow rate in cubic feet per second 
C = coefficient of runoff (see Exhibit 1) 
I = intensity of rainfall in inches per hour (see Exhibits 2 and 3) 
A = drainage area in acres 
K = coefficient of correction (equal to 1.0 for areas of less than 640 acres) (see Exhibit 4) 
(b)  For drainage areas larger than 1,000 acres, runoff will be determined by Soil Conservation Service (SCS) procedures according to the National Engineering Handbook on Hydrology. For watersheds with drainage areas between 1,000 and 3,200 acres, the SCS procedures presented in either Chapter 2 of the SCS Field Manual or the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Technical Paper No. 149 (Revised) shall be used. For drainage areas larger than 3,200 acres, Section 4 of the Handbook shall be used. 
(c)  The Manning equations will be used for sizing all drainage structures. The applicable equations are: 
V = (1.486/n)(R 0.667 )(S 0.5 ) 
and 
Q = (1.486/n)(A)(R 0.667 )(S 0.5 ) 
Where: 
V = average velocity of flow in feet per second 
n = the Manning roughness coefficient for the material used (i.e., concrete, corrugated metal, etc.) 
A = cross sectional area in square feet required to pass the flow 
R = hydraulic radius in feet (area divided by wetted perimeter) 
S = slope of the structure in feet per foot

(a)  The city council finds and declares all of the following: 
(1)  Driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways is a privilege, not a right. 
(2)  Of all drivers involved in fatal accidents, a driver with a suspended license is more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than a properly licensed driver. 
(3)  Alabamians who comply with the law are frequently victims of traffic accidents caused by unlicensed drivers. These innocent victims suffer considerable pain and property loss at the hands of people who flaunt the law. 
(4)  It is necessary and appropriate to take additional steps to prevent unlicensed drivers from driving. The city has a critical interest in enforcing its traffic laws and in keeping unlicensed drivers from illegally driving. Seizing the motor vehicles used by unlicensed drivers serves a significant governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city from the harm of unlicensed drivers who are involved in a disproportionate number of traffic incidents, and the avoidance of the associated destruction and damage to lives and property. 
(5)  This section is consistent with the due process requirements of the United States Constitution and the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974). 
(b)(1)a. 
If a driver is unable to produce a valid driver's license on the demand of a law-enforcement officer, the motor vehicle is subject to impoundment regardless of ownership, unless the law-enforcement officer is reasonably able, by other means, to verify that the driver is properly licensed. Prior to impounding the motor vehicle, a law-enforcement officer shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the license status of a driver who claims to be properly licensed, but who is unable to produce the license on demand of the law-enforcement officer. A notation of the officer's attempt to verify that the driver is properly licensed shall be noted on the departmental report. The driver and occupants of the motor vehicle will be transported to a place of safety by the impounding officer and a vehicle-impound report made with a full inventory of items in the motor vehicle. 
b.  A law-enforcement officer shall not impound a motor vehicle pursuant to this section if the license of the driver expired within the preceding 60 days and the driver would otherwise have been properly licensed. 
c.  If the owner of the motor vehicle or another family member of the owner is present in the motor vehicle and has a valid license, the motor vehicle shall not be impounded and towed. 
d.  If there is a medical necessity jeopardizing life or limb, the law-enforcement officer may elect not to impound the motor vehicle. 
e.  A law-enforcement officer who requests that a motor vehicle be towed onto the property of another pursuant to this section shall do so by using a vehicle impound report. 
(2)  Reserved. 
(c)  Any owner of a motor vehicle (including a lienholder, person with a security interest in the motor vehicle, a lessor of the motor vehicle, assignee of the lessor, or the person who is the registered owner of the motor vehicle) who suffers any loss due to the impoundment of any motor vehicle pursuant to this section may recover the amount of the loss from the driver who was unable to produce a valid driver's license at the request of the law-enforcement officer. 
(d)  The person redeeming the motor vehicle from the automobile dealer, wrecker service owner, repair service owner, or person, firm, or governmental entity on whose property the motor vehicle was lawfully towed at the written request of a law-enforcement officer pursuant to this section will be responsible for paying the set fee for the removal and for the storage of the motor vehicle. 
(e)  Reserved.

(Ord. No. 2019-2079, §§ 3, 20, adopted 2019-04-22)
2.5.3. Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are those that have some special effect, which differs from the potential impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have uniqueness such that their effect upon the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of a use being proposed in a particular location. As such, Conditional Uses must be reviewed in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the proposed use; whether, and to what extent the use at the proposed location is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the intents of this Ordinance, and any other development policies and/or regulations of the City; and whether, and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, welfare, and safety in general. Requests for Conditional Uses as designated within the district regulations are permitted only after approval by the Commission.
Sec. 2.5.2.D cont.

A. Application. All Conditional Uses shall require the submission of an application to the Commission. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Official by the property owner or authorized agent at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the date on which the application is scheduled to be heard by the Commission, and shall include a Conceptual Site Plan in accordance with this Section. The submission of a conceptual use site plan is intended for administrative efficiency and does not relieve the applicant from providing a formal site plan satisfactory to the City Engineer upon approval of the conceptual use unless the Commission specifically relieves the applicant from such requirement.
1) Submission requirements. The applicant must submit to the Community Development Department a Conceptual Site Plan of property on which the Conditional Use is requested, drawn to scale, to include but not limited to, the following:

Conditional Uses shall be in conformity with the area and dimensional regulations of the applicable district and may only exceed a height limit in accordance with §5.4.
2) Effect of Conditions. The Commission may impose such conditions for approval as it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and further the purposes of this Ordinance, in relation both to the items listed above and to any other factor it deems relevant. Such approval and conditions shall be granted to the property, structure, and/or use for which Conditional Use is approved and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions attached to any Conditional Use constitute violations of this Ordinance.
3) Decision. Upon approval by the Commission, the Conditional Use shall be deemed to be approved, in which case, the applicant may then proceed with any other required approvals or permits required by the City. If disapproved by the Commission, the applicant may appeal such decision to the Council. Such appeal shall only be accepted within fifteen (15) working days of the decision of the Commission.
C. Limit on Re-application. No new application shall be initiated for the same request on the same parcel of land more than once a year, unless specifically authorized by the Commission on the grounds that the circumstances and conditions relevant to the request have changed significantly since the prior hearing, including but not limited to, changes to the Comprehensive Master Plan, Zoning Ordinance, district regulations or boundaries, and/or abutting land uses, availability of adequate public services, utilities, and thoroughfares.
2.5.4. Special Exception Uses. All uses permitted by special exception as listed in the district regulations shall require the submission of an application to the Board.
A. Application and Procedure.
1) A written application for a Special Exception Use shall be submitted at least twenty-one (21) days ahead of the regularly scheduled meeting indicating the section of this Ordinance under which the Special Exception Use is requested.
2) A Public Hearing shall be held before the Board, in which any party may appear in person, or by agent, or attorney.
B. Review Standards. A Special Exception Use shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:
1) The Board shall find that it is empowered under this Ordinance to grant a Special Exception Use, and that the granting of the Special Exception Use will not adversely affect the public interest.
2) Before any Special Exception Use approval is issued, the Board shall find that the proposed use is in compliance with supplemental regulations, if any, governing individual Special Exception Uses and shall consider the potential arrangement and provisions for the following:
a) Satisfactory ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control
Sec. 2.5.3.B(1) cont.
2-20
b) Provision of off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to the items in (a) and the economic, noise, glare, and odor effects of the use on adjoining properties in the area
c) Location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse effects upon surrounding properties
d) Utilities, with reference to locations, availability and compatibility
e) Screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties with reference to type, location, and dimensions
f) Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district
g) Location, use, plan, elevations and dimensions of each building or structure to be constructed
h) The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures and the location, dimension, and arrangement of all open spaces and yards, with reference to their visual compatibility with surrounding properties
i) General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district
C. Conditions for Approval. The Board may impose such conditions for approval that it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and the intent of the Comprehensive Master Plan and this Ordinance in relation to the items listed above and as may otherwise be reasonably necessary. Such conditions shall apply to the land, structure, and use for which the special exception is granted and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions lawfully attached to any special exception shall be deemed to be violations of this Ordinance.
2.5.5. Variances. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, building or structures in the same district, or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. It is the intent of this Ordinance that variances be used only to overcome some physical condition of a parcel of land, which poses a practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using the property in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
A. Application. An application for a variance shall be made on forms made available by and filed with the Zoning Official or Secretary of the Board at least twenty-one (21) days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board.
B. Variances within Areas Subject to Flooding. Any application for a variance related to regulations and restrictions to property development and use due to said propertys location within a Special Flood Hazard District shall follow the process provided within the Citys adopted Flood Ordinance.
C. Variance Review Standards. Variances may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board that all of the following conditions exist:
1) There are exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
2) A personal hardship exists on the part of an individual property owner which will not permit him to enjoy the full utilization of his property which is given to others without the city. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater value or profit would result if the variance were granted.
Sec. 2.5.4.B(2) cont.
2-21
3) Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other residents of the district in which the property is located.
4) A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is located.
5) The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood.
6) The hardship is not self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases the property with or without knowledge of the restrictions.
7) The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
8) The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures which is not permitted in the district involved.
§2.6. Appeals. Appeals from the decisions of the Zoning and Building Officials shall be heard by the Board, unless otherwise specified in this Ordinance.

ARTICLE 3. GENERAL REGULATIONS
§3.1. Districts. For the purposes stated in the preliminary provisions of this Ordinance, the City is divided
into districts of such number, shape, and area, and of such common unity of purpose, adaptability or use, which are deemed most suitable to provide for the best, general civic use, protect the common
rights and interests within each district, preserve the general rights, and interests of all; and by further regulations to limit the location, uses and occupancy of buildings, structures and land to be used for trade, industry, residence or other structures, including the ration of lot occupancy and coverage, street setback lines, sizes of yards, and other open spaces. 3.1.1. Traditional and Conventional Zones Distinguished A. Purpose and Intent For the purposes of implementing the goals and objectives in the land use plan, the city has traditional and Conventional Zones. Where indicated, the design and development standards in this chapter establish different standards for new development or redevelopment in either Traditional Zones or Conventional Zones. Different standards are established in recognition of the need to: 1) Distinguish between portions of the city that have developed or will develop more in
keeping with conventional or traditional neighborhood development principles; 2) Preserve and enhance the character of the downtown and established surrounding neighborhoods; and 3) Provide development standards that are more reflective of the citys existing or planned character. B. General Characteristics of Traditional and Conventional Zones
Unless otherwise stated or modified through Planned Unit Developments, new development occurring within the city shall be compatible with the general characteristics of the area in which it is located. 1) Traditional Zone Portions of the city designated as traditional zones typically include development with the following characteristics:
a) A modified grid street system with a prevalent use of alleys and use of cul-de-sac
streets only where topography or other natural constraints exist; b) Lots with variable sizes, widths, and orientations in proximity to one another along with the provision of formal open spaces; c) Human-scaled buildings with high quality exterior materials located within proximity or adjacent to the primary streets they front;
d) Pedestrian and transit orientation, with widespread provision of on-street parking
and off-street surface parking areas located beside or behind buildings; and e) Integrated residential and nonresidential land uses located in the same building
or in proximity to one another without extensive buffering.
2) Conventional Zones Portions of the city designated as conventional zones typically include development with the following characteristics:
3-2
a) Curvilinear streets with some cul-de-sacs and alleys serving narrow lots or areas subject to environmental constraints;
b) Lots with relatively uniform widths and sizes along with formal and informal open space areas; c) Both pedestrian and automobile-oriented streetscapes including some lots fronted by surface parking lots located between the street and the building they serve; d) Nonresidential developments typically set back from the streets they front and
extended in strip form along streets; and
e) Segregation of different land uses into groups of similar type separated from other types by buffering and location.
C. Location
1) The geographic extents of traditional and conventional zones shall be depicted on the zoning map. All lots in the city shall have a traditional or conventional zoning
designation. Some lots may be indicated as being appropriate for either designation
but the standards shall not be mixed within a single lot or development. 2) Applicants considering new development or redevelopment should consult the Engineering Services and Community Development to determine the applicability of traditional or conventional zoning standards. D. Applicability 1) Lots located within a traditional zone shall be subject to the traditional standards of this ordinance as well as all general requirements.
2) Lots located within a conventional zone shall be subject to the conventional standards of this ordinance as well as all general requirements.
3) All applications, Development Plans, Preliminary Plats, Final Plats, or Site Plans (as appropriate) shall indicate the applicable zoning district.
4) In cases where a development or design standard in this ordinance does not indicate its applicability to lots in conventional or traditional zones, then that standard shall be
considered a general requirement and apply to all lots regardless of zone.
3.1.2. Establishment of Zoning Districts. In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the location of buildings designed for specific uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or structurally altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of the land area, and to regulate and determine the areas of open spaces within and surrounding such
buildings, the City is hereby divided into the following districts:
A. Traditional Districts
DWTN Downtown District

§3.2. Zoning Map The boundaries of the districts are as shown on the "Athens Zoning Map," together with
any subsequent zoning map amendments. Unless otherwise shown on said zoning map, the boundaries of districts are lot lines, the center lines of streets or alleys or such lines extended, railroad right- of-
way lines, or corporate limit lines. The zoning map and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon are a part of this ordinance. Such map shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Official and shall show thereon the date of adoption and revisions of said map.
§3.3. Interpretation of district boundaries. The zoning administrator shall make an interpretation of the Athens Zoning Map" upon request of any person. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall apply: 3.3.1. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines or land lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 3.3.2. In unsubdivided property or tracts where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such
boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing on such maps.
3.3.3. Where boundaries are approximately parallel to public right-of- way lines, such boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto.
3.3.4. In case any further uncertainty exists, the board of adjustment shall determine the location of boundaries. §3.4. General Use Requirements.
3.4.1. Application of this ordinance: No structure shall be construed, erected, placed or maintained
and no land use commenced or continued within the city except as specifically or by necessary implication, authorized by this ordinance. 3.4.2. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance: A. No land or structure may be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located. B. No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in conformity with the area and height regulations of the district in which the building is located.
Sec. 3.1.2. cont.
3-4
C. The minimum building lines, parking spaces, open spaces, and lot areas, required by this ordinance for each existing building or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon nor reduced.
D. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on one lot. However,
this ordinance specifically permits more than one building on a lot, in the case of attached dwellings, and uses which require development plan approval. Townhouses shall be constructed as one building on more than one lot. E. On-frame modular buildings are only permitted within the R-MH District.
3.4.3. Temporary structures for uses incidental to construction work may be permitted in any district
during the period that construction work is in progress, but such temporary structures shall be removed upon completion or abandonment of the construction work. Approval by the BZA shall be required for the location, placement, installation, movement or use of any portable or temporary building beyond those used for construction purposes. The approval shall specify the approved use of the building and the temporary period for which the permit is to remain valid, up to 2 years. 3.4.4. Utility structures including, but not limited to, poles, wires, cross arms, transformers attached
to poles, guy wires, insulators, conduits and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of electric power or to provide telephone, telegraph, internet, or cable television service and pipe lines, vents, valves, hydrants, regulators, meters and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of gas, oil, water or other fluids may be constructed, erected, repaired, maintained or replaced within any district within the City of Athens. This is not to be construed to include the erection or construction of buildings or electric substations.
§3.5. Nonconforming Uses and Buildings
3.5.1. Statement of Intent. Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures, which were lawful when established, but which would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
3.5.2. Expansion. Nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended. Buildings
not meeting height requirements are exempt from this rule notwithstanding the rule for restoration found in Sec. 3.5.3.A below. In such instances, the building may be added onto at the same height of the nonconforming structure so long as the addition does not exceed 25% of the GFA of the nonconforming structure. Nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
3.5.3. Continuance. A nonconforming use or building lawfully existing at the effective date of this ordinance may be continued, except as hereafter provided, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance. A. Restoration after damages: Other than detached dwellings, no nonconforming building or structure which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value prior to the time of such damage, shall be repaired or restored except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. However, for buildings or
structures not damaged or destroyed beyond fifty (50) percent of its replacement value prior
to the time of such damage, they may be repaired and used as before if repairs are initiated in twelve (12) months and completed within two (2) years of such damage. Sec. 3.4.2. cont.
3-5
B. Abandonment: A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a continuous period in
excess of 180 days shall not be reestablished, and any future use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of this ordinance. C. Change in use: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use which is changed to a conforming use shall not be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. 3.5.4. Nonconforming Lots. There exist lots in the city, which were lawful when platted, but which
are too small to be developed under the provisions of this ordinance. (Nonconforming lot(s) of record.) Said lots may be vacant or occupied by an existing building or structure. It is the intent of this ordinance to maintain the average lot width and developed density within each of the city's subdivisions or districts. A. Consolidation of Lots of Record. If two (2) or more lots or parcels are adjacent or contiguous to each other and are under common ownership on the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequent thereto, such adjacent or contiguous lots or parcels shall be combined to form one (1) lot or parcel [hereinafter referred to as "zoning lot(s)"] and shall be considered one (1) zoning lot for purposes of complying with the Athens Zoning Ordinance minimum lot width and area requirements, if any such individual lot(s) do not meet said minimum requirements.
No zoning lot(s), or any portion thereof, shall be used in any way that conflicts with the regulations or requirements of this ordinance. No building permit shall be issued for construction on any nonconforming lot or portion of any zoning lot(s) that is sold, transferred,
or conveyed in violation of the provision of this ordinance and/or of this section, provided
however, that this provision shall not prevent the dividing of presently existing townhouses or other multifamily dwellings into separate ownership units.
The provisions of this section are intended to apply to all nonconforming lots or parcels whether shown on an approved or recorded plot or plan. No building permit shall be issued
for any zoning lot(s), or any portion thereof, until such time as said zoning lot is resurveyed
so as to create one (1) or more lots or parcels which conform with the provisions of this ordinance which include, but are not limited to, the minimum lot width or frontage and area requirements of the district in which such property is located.
B. Area and Setback Modifications for Lots of Record. Where a lot of record at the time of the
effective date of this Ordinance had less area or less width than required for the applicable district, said lot may nonetheless be used as a building site provided the yard space and other requirements conform to the requirements for the applicable district. If the lot is of insufficient size to accommodate the required yards, said yards may be adjusted with a plot plan, drafted by a professional surveyor or engineer, approved by the Zoning Official as
follows:
1) For front yard modifications, see Sec. 6.1.8 Transitional Features.
2) If modifications are required for side yards, the plot plan will need to note the percentage difference between the actual width of the lot and the minimum width
(frontage) required in the district. The side yards may then be reduced in width by that percentage to the nearest foot.
3) If modifications are required for rear yards, the plot plan will need to note the percentage difference between the actual size of the lot and the minimum size
required in the district. The rear yard may then be reduced in depth by that percentage to the nearest foot.
4) If these remedies still present a case where hardships remain as defined in this ordinance, relief may be sought from the BZA. Sec. 3.5.3 cont.

In the event there is a change in the use of a property, regardless of whether the proposed use constitutes an increase in intensity, at a minimum, landscaping, screening, off-street parking areas, and exterior lighting shall be brought into conformity with the applicable provisions of Article 6.
C. In the event that there is a change in the use of a property such that the proposed use would
require a greater buffer (from abutting uses) than the existing use, a buffer shall be provided
as required in Article 6. Where due to the location of a existing buildings and/or other site constraints, the buffer width cannot be met, a Variance may be issued by the Board, in which
case the Board shall require a wall/fence and landscaping at a greater density to achieve a
buffer configuration consistent with the intent of Article 6.

J. Encourage a pedestrian and bicyclistfriendly environment;
K. Enhance the citys sense of place and contribute to the sustainability and lasting value of the city;
L. Shape development in a manner that is most beneficial to the citizens in the city; and
M. Ensure greater public safety, convenience, and accessibility through the physical design and location of land-use activities.
6.1.2. Applicability
A. General. Unless exempted by Subsection 6.1.2(C), Exemptions, the building and site design standards in this section apply to all new residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use development or redevelopment in the city. For expansions or alterations, the building design standards apply to an expanded or altered portion of any existing building, and to the entire structure when an expansion or alteration exceeds 50 percent of the buildings existing square footage at the time of the expansion or alteration.
B. Review for Compliance. Review of proposed development to ensure compliance with the standards in this section shall occur at the time of Site Plan, Preliminary Plat, Development Plan, or Building Permit review, as appropriate.
C. Exemptions. The following development shall be exempt from the standards in this section to the extent they conflict or overlap with the following:
1) Development subject to a Site Plan, Preliminary Plat, Conservation Design Plan, Development Plan, or Building Permit approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance, provided this approval has not expired;
2) Height limits on nonconforming structures as referenced in Sec. 3.5.2; and
6-2
3) Temporary housing, construction trailers, temporary real estate office, or temporary structures permitted as part of an Educational Facility or Institutional Use in accordance with Section 3.4.3.
6.1.3. Height and Density. No building shall hereafter be erected or altered so as to exceed the height limit or to exceed the density regulations of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located.
A. Accessory Structures and Appurtenances. Chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, head houses, fire towers, gas tanks, steeples, penthouses, stacks, tanks, water towers, ornamental towers and spires, or necessary mechanical appurtenances, where permitted may be erected to any height not in conflict with existing or hereafter adopted ordinance of the City except that, where permitted in connection with residential uses, such structures shall be limited to a height of twenty (20) ft above the maximum height of the applicable district. The height of wireless telecommunications facilities shall be in accordance with the Wireless Telecommunications Facilities Siting Ordinance 1320-1999 Section 9 Height of Telecommunications Tower(s).
B. Storage Buildings. The limitation on number of stories shall not apply to buildings used exclusively for storage purposes, provided such buildings do not exceed the height in feet permitted in the applicable district.
6.1.4. Lots.
A. Lot Size. No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record in single ownership, shall be reduced in size so that the lot width or depth, front, side or rear yards, lot area per dwelling unit or other requirements of this Ordinance are not maintained. This prohibition shall not be construed to prevent the purchase or condemnation of narrow strips of land for public purposes.
B. General Requirements for Lots without Sanitary Sewer Access. No residential lot, not connected or planned to be connected to a sanitary sewer system, shall be permitted to be less than 15,000 sf in area. Unsewered lots shall not be created by subdivision nor developed until the applicant has submitted evidence that the soil conditions of the subject land are adequate to accommodate individual disposal systems at the proposed density. Such evidence shall be provided to the Commission at the time of any required subdivision approval. Upon a finding of poor soil percolation characteristics by the Department with due consideration for the site and the size and location of the proposed dwelling, the Commission may require a larger minimum lot size sufficient enough to accommodate a properly functioning septic system. Plans for installation of such individual septic systems shall be in accord with applicable State and County regulations and as approved by the Limestone County Health Department.
C. Access to Lots. No building shall be erected on a lot that does not abut a public thoroughfare, unless otherwise specifically permitted in this Ordinance.
D. Minimum Lot Width and Lot Frontage. Except as provided herein, any lot not meeting the required lot width and lot frontage of the applicable district shall be considered a flag lot and shall only be permitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Subdivision Regulations.
1) For lots fronting on cul-de-sacs, the lot width at the front building line shall be no less than the minimum lot width required in the applicable district; and the minimum lot frontage shall be no less than forty (40) ft, as measured along the arc of the front lot line.
6-3
2) For lots along the outer side of curved thoroughfares, the minimum lot frontage shall be established by the following equation and as described in Figure 6-1:
Min. Lot Frontage = (radius of curve x min. lot width)
radius of curve + min. front yard setback
6.1.5. Yards.
A. Yard Use Limitations. No part of a yard or other open space required about any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another building or use.
B. General Yard Modifications. Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky unobstructed by any structure or part thereof, and unoccupied for storage, servicing or similar use except as provided herein.
1) Sills, belt courses or ornamental features may project beyond the building line not more than six (6) inches.
2) Cornices or eaves may project beyond the building line not more than eighteen (18) inches.
3) Decks and other un-roofed habitable structures, or ornamental features which do not extend more than five (5) feet above grade may project beyond the rear or side building lines, provided such projections be not closer than five (5) feet to a lot line.
4) Mechanical/electrical appurtenances which bottoms do not extend more than five (5) feet above bottom grade may project within the required minimum distance from property line to building line.
C. Conflicting setbacks. When setbacks as prescribed by this Ordinance are in conflict with setbacks indicated on a subdivision plat, the more stringent setbacks shall apply.
D. Setbacks from Major Arterials. A minimum setback of fifty (50) ft, of which the first twenty (20) ft for all non-residential uses shall be landscaped and maintained in accordance with Sec. 6.2, shall be required along all major arterials, as defined in the Athens Transportation Plan, unless the applicable zoning regulations require a greater setback; provided however, that residential uses that do not derive their access from the major arterial shall be excluded from this provision. In addition:
1) Exterior storage of materials shall be in the side and rear yards only and shall be contained and screened by fencing or landscaping in such a manner as to be neat in appearance when viewed from any street. No exterior display of products or merchandise is permitted in the required front yard except for sales of farm equipment, new and used cars, trailers, recreational vehicles, and manufactured homes. However, such uses shall not be permitted in the first ten (10) ft of the required front yard.
2) Off-street parking spaces are not permitted in the first twenty (20) ft of the required front yard as measured from the arterial ROW.
3) All businesses offering merchandise of any description for sale or rent shall have a permanent sales building on the lot except as provided in Paragraph D below.
4) The temporary, seasonal sale of perishable farm products is permitted so long as all evidence of such operations is removed from the premises each night and such operations are not conducted in any part of the required front yard.
5) Where these regulations conflict with other applicable zoning provisions, the more stringent shall apply.

1) In the case of institutional, commercial or industrial buildings in an appropriate zoning district, the Commission may, upon Site Plan approval, approve additional buildings in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
2) In the case of a tract of land under single ownership being of sufficient size to accommodate more than one single-family or multi-family building, the Commission may approve the construction of more than one building, if in its opinion the land on which the building is constructed can at a future date be subdivided into lots that will meet all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations pertaining to such subdividing and density requirements.

6.1.8. Transitional Features
A. Purpose and Intent. Transitional features are architectural elements or site aspects used to provide a transition between land uses, subdivisions, and sites in an effort to mitigate conflicts and to provide design compatibility. It is the intent of these standards to:
1) Blend new development with existing development form and pattern;
2) Reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture;
3) Limit the excessive consumption of available land though the utilization of large vegetated buffers;
4) Limit interruptions in vehicular and pedestrian connections created by efforts to segregate uses; and
5) Establish or maintain vibrant pedestrian-oriented areas where differing uses can operate in proximity to one another.
B. Applicability
1) Transitional features shall be required:
a) When design compatibility cannot be achieved between land uses, lots, or structures; or
b) Between lots or uses within a single mixed-use development located in either traditional or Conventional Zones.
2) In Conventional Zones, the DRT may require the use of transitional features in addition to the use of a buffer, in accordance with the standards in Section 6.2.6, where such transitional features are necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture. If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT regarding the use of transitional features, the applicant may appeal the decision Planning Commission and/or Council, depending on the type of application.
3) In Traditional Zones, the DRT may require the use of a buffer in-lieu of or in addition to the use of a transitional feature where such buffer is necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, form, or architecture. If the applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT regarding the use of buffers or transitional features, the applicant may appeal the decision to Planning Commission and/or Council, depending on the type of application.
C. Standards. In areas where existing blocks or 500 ft long frontages including the subject property are at least 75% developed, and a transition between different land uses or buildings differing in scale, mass, height, proportion, setbacks, form, or architecture is needed, the following approaches shall be used, subject to the approval of the Zoning Official and the Building Department, to establish a transition between uses and buildings:
1) For differing uses, use setbacks that are within 25 percent of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block face provided no new use is closer to the right-of-way than the closest existing principal structure;
2) In residential districts or developments (no differing uses), no building shall be set back more, or located closer to the street, than the average of the setbacks of the existing dwellings on the same side of the street, within the same block or two hundred fifty (250) feet each side thereof, whichever is less.
6-8
Figure 6-2: The new construction (outlined in red) on the right demonstrates appropriate average setbacks. The dwelling outlined in red on the left has a front setback that is too deep.
3) Use lot widths that are within 40 percent of the average lot width for existing lots on the same block;
4) Ensure the perceived façade width and height on façades of adjacent structures and structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither façade exceeds the others dimensions by more than 25 percent;
Figure 6-3: Ensuring similar façade height and width dimensions of opposing façades can be an effective means of establishing a transition between uses.
5) Graduate building height, scale, and mass through utilization of any of the following methods:
a) Building step-backs to reduce the bulk of a buildings upper floors;
Sec. 6.1.8.C cont.
6-9
b) Dividing buildings into smaller parts, including detached buildings, to reduce effective visual bulk and to maintain the scale and rhythm of the existing pattern of development;
c) Sight lines or angular planes to gauge the appropriate building height necessary to achieve a steady, incremental transition; or
d) Other techniques to break up the scale of a building to complement existing development patterns, as approved by the DRT or the Department of Neighborhood Services.
Figure 6-4: Step-backs in building heights between different use types can be an effective transitional element.
6) Use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows, doors, awnings, arcades, pilasters, cornices, wall offsets, building materials, and other building articulations included on the lower intensity use as depicted in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-5: The example on the bottom demonstrates effective use of transition features.
7) Locate off-street parking, loading, service, and utility areas in a manner consistent with similar site features on surrounding sites. When adjacent to residential areas, off-street parking, loading, service, and utility areas shall be strategically located to mitigate disturbance to nearby residents. Additionally, loading and service areas shall not front a street and shall be screened in accordance with Subsections 6.4.5, Perimeter Landscape Standards, and 6.4.9 Screening;
8) Prevent incompatible exterior lighting or sources of audible noise or disturbance from building façades facing lower intensity uses;
9) Prevent abrupt changes in roof form by allowing adjacent incompatible uses to use similar roof types, slopes, or arrangements;
Sec. 6.1.8.C cont.
6-10
10) Orient outdoor dining, gathering areas, and other site attributes such as, vending machines, away from adjacent residential uses;
11) Orient primary building façades directly across from opposing primary façades regardless of use type (as seen in Figure 6-8); and
Figure 6-6: Organizing buildings so that the primary façades face one another can serve as a transitional feature when two different building types occupy opposing sides of a street.
12) When dealing with multi-building developments on one or more lots, establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity (colored orange in Figure 6-7) are sited between high-intensity uses (colored brown in Figure 6-9) and low-intensity uses (colored yellow in Figure 6-7) (e.g., office uses between retail and detached residential).
Figure 6-7: Multi-building developments can be organized to concentrate the highest intensity uses in a single area and feather the intensity and density outwards from high intensity centers.
6.1.9. Residential Development. Attached and detached residential structures shall comply with the following basic residential design standards.
A. Basic Standards
1) Building Compatibility
a) Traditional Zones
Sec. 6.1.8.C cont.
6-11
(i) Residential development in Traditional Zones shall be physically integrated with surrounding residential structures through the use of design compatibility, including elements such as appropriate scale, setbacks, materials, roof forms, lot sizes, and streetscape.
Figure 6-8: The detached dwelling in the foreground exhibits compatibility with the surrounding dwellings in regard to design, scale, setbacks, and materials.
(ii) When design compatibility cannot be achieved between two or more different residential use types (e.g., detached and attached residential uses), transitional features as set forth in Subsection 6.1.8 shall be provided.
b) Conventional Zones. Within Conventional Zones, either transitional features or buffers (See Subsection 6.2.6, Buffers.) shall be used between adjacent but differing residential use types (e.g., detached and attached residential uses).
2) Building Orientation. All residential development within Traditional Zones shall be located parallel to the associated street or be consistent with existing development patterns rather than being sited at unconventional angles, unless irregular lot layouts require alternative orientations.
Sec. 6.1.9.A cont.
6-12
Figure 6-9: This image depicts dwellings that are parallel to the street and consistent with one another.
3) Setbacks. Setbacks should be in accordance with Article 4, Traditional Zoning Regulations, or Article 5, Conventional Zoning Regulations.
4) Façade Standards
a) Primary façade materials shall not change at outside corners and shall continue along any side façade visible from a street right-of-way; however, materials may change where side or rear wings meet the main body of the dwelling.
Figure 6-10: The Dwelling on the left demonstrates appropriate exterior wrapping, while the image on the right depicts a dwelling with inappropriate material changes at the corner of the building.
b) Materials changes shall occur along a horizontal line or where two forms meet. It is acceptable, however, that change of materials occur as accents around windows, doors, cornices, at corners, or as a repetitive pattern.
Sec. 6.1.9.A cont.
6-13
Figure 6-11: This image demonstrates how material changes should occur along straight lines.
5) Foundations.
a) For homes within the Traditional Zoning Districts, the finished floor elevation at the front façade shall be located above grade in accordance with the following standards:
(i) For setbacks of ten feet or more, the finished floor elevation of the front facade shall be a minimum of 12 inches above grade; and
(ii) For setbacks of less than ten feet, the finished floor elevation of the front facade shall be a minimum of 24 inches above grade.
Figure 6-12: Residential structures incorporate raised foundations, as depicted in the photo to the right, to give a vertical orientation and well-proportioned appearance, as well as to provide privacy for occupants.
b) Exposed foundation walls or piers shall be clad in face brick, stone, stucco, or some other masonry material accurately imitating these materials. Smooth-faced standard concrete block is prohibited unless troweled with a stucco-like finish to a thickness in which the joints of the block are not visible.
c) In cases where piers are used, painted or stained latticework screening shall be installed between piers on front and side building façades.
d) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the use of slab foundations, provided:
Sec. 6.1.9.A cont.
6-14
(i) The outer edge of the slab is clad in the materials required in this subsection; and
(ii) It extends to the minimum height above grade required in traditional zones.
6) Porches. If porches are provided, they shall have a minimum useable depth of at least four (4) feet.
7) Windows. Windows on primary façades shall be vertically proportioned so that the vertical dimension is greater than the horizontal dimension, and vertically aligned between floors. Exceptions may be approved to accomplish a particular architectural theme, such as in the prairie style. Where used, shutters shall be proportioned to cover one-half the width of the window from each side or the total window from one side.
Figure 6-13: The drawing on the right demonstrates appropriate vertical alignment for windows.
8) Materials
a) Materials permitted in Traditional Zones are listed in Article 4, Traditional Zone Regulations.
b) Developments with more than one residential structure shall use materials that are compatible with one another.
c) The use of aluminum siding, corrugated metal siding, or exposed smooth-faced concrete block is prohibited. High-quality metal siding (e.g., stainless steel, copper, brushed nickel, brass, etc.) may be approved for use on a case-by-case basis.
d) Vinyl siding and synthetic stucco (EIFS) shall be subject to the following limitations in all zones except the HN District:
(i) Vinyl siding is allowed on eaves and soffits.
(ii) These materials are prohibited at any point within 30 inches of the exterior finished grade level
(iii) If used, it must be above a brick, stone, split face block, or masonry that extends from exterior finished grade to 30 inches above exterior finished grade, or to the bottom of the windows, whichever measurement is greater. Masonry materials that do not meet this requirement are smooth-faced block (prohibited by [c]) and faux masonry veneer.
(iv) Accessory structures must have brick, stone, split face block, masonry that extends from exterior finished grade level to 30 inches above exterior
Sec. 6.1.9.A(5) cont.
6-15
finished grade level. Masonry materials that do not meet this requirement are smooth-faced block (prohibited by [c]) and faux masonry veneer.
e) Vinyl siding and synthetic stucco (EIFS) shall be subject to the following limitations in the HN District:
(i) Vinyl siding is allowed on eaves and soffits.
(ii) Accessory structures are allowed to match the materials of a detached house, with the same limitations as 6.1.9.A(8)(d)(iv).
f) Where two or more materials are proposed to be combined on a facade, the heavier and more massive elements shall be located below the lighter elements (i.e., brick shall be located below stucco). It is acceptable to provide the heavier material as a detail on the corner of a building or along cornices or windows.
Figure 6-14: These homes demonstrate how heavier materials (brick) should be located below lighter materials (wood siding).
g) The exposure width of horizontal siding shall be no more than six inches.
h) The exterior building material of chimneys shall not be siding (vinyl or fibrous cement), and shall either:
(i) Match the building material of the foundation; or
(ii) Be stone or brick.
(Ord. No. 2019-2079, §§ 24, 27 adopted 2019-04-22)
6.1.10. Detached Residential Structures. In addition to the basic standards for all residential development, detached residential structures shall comply with the following:
A. Reverse Frontage Discouraged
1) Generally
a) Except for circumstances listed in Subsection 6.1.10.A(2), Acceptable Situations, residential lots with a reverse frontage are generally discouraged, particularly in Traditional Zones.
b) Lots along the perimeter of a subdivision should generally be oriented so that dwellings front perimeter streets or open space instead of backing up to streets around the outside of the subdivision. This is particularly important for lots fronting local streets internal to a development.
2) Acceptable Situations. Reverse frontage is acceptable for residential structures on lots in the following locations, provided the rear of the dwelling is properly screened:
a) Lots or sites fronting freeways, arterial, or collector streets in Conventional Zones; and
Sec. 6.1.9.A(8) cont.
6-16
b) Existing platted lots in residential subdivisions or Planned Unit Developments approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
3) Screening for Reverse Frontage. Residential developments with reverse frontage lots shall provide a Type A Buffer between the lots and the public street. (See Figure 6-54).
Figure 6-15: The image on the top demonstrates appropriate screening for reverse frontage lots. Fences or walls without landscape are inappropriate.
4) Alternatives to Reverse Frontage. The use of a parallel access drive is an alternative to reversed frontage. Where curb cuts for driveways are not an option along the associated street, access by rear alleys is another alternative in Traditional Zones.
Figure 6-16: Rear alleys can be used as an alternative to reverse frontage lots.
Sec. 6.1.10.A(2) cont.
6-17
B. Lot Size. Except where modified through the planned unit development process (See Subsection 2.4.2.), lots intended for new detached residential dwellings adjacent to existing lots intended for detached residential dwellings shall be no less than 75 percent of the average lot size of existing contiguous lots.
Figure 6-17: New lots intended for detached residential development should be of a comparable size to any abutting detached residential lots as a means of maintaining compatibility.
C. Primary Entrance Orientation
1) Detached residential development shall be oriented so that the primary entrance faces the street or an open space, such as a square.
2) In the case of corner lots, the primary entrance shall face the street from which the structure derives its street address.
3) Alternative orientations may be considered by the Planning Department in cases where such alternative orientations are consistent with existing adjacent development.
6.1.11. Attached Residential Structures. In addition to the basic standards for all residential development (See Subsection 6.3.5(1)), attached dwellings shall comply with the following standards:
A. Orientation.
1) The primary entrance and front façade of individual buildings within an attached residential development shall be oriented towards the following (listed in priority order):
a) Perimeter streets;
b) Primary internal streets;
c) Common open space set-aside areas;
d) Parks or other common open space; and
e) Secondary internal streets.
Sec. 6.1.10.B cont.
6-18
Figure 6-28: This diagram demonstrates proper orientation of buildings within a multiple-building attached residential development.
2) Primary entrances or façades shall not be oriented towards off-street parking lots, garages, or carports.
3) Walls of buildings on corner lots in Traditional Zones shall be constructed a maximum of ten feet from the back of the sidewalk or street right-of-way edge, whichever is the greatest distance from the street.
B. Building Design
1) Building details, including roof forms, siding materials, windows, doors, and trim shall reflect a consistent architectural style.
2) The maximum length of any attached residential building, regardless of the quantity of dwellings, shall be 200 feet.
3) No more than six side-by-side townhouse dwelling units shall be attached in any single row.
4) All sides of a attached residential building visible from lands occupied by or designated for detached residential uses, an existing public street right-of-way, or other public lands shall display a similar level of quality and architectural detailing.
Sec. 6.1.11.A cont.
6-19
Figure 6-29: This attached residential structure exhibits a similar level of architectural detail on all sides visible from a street or from other detached residential uses.
5) Individual attached residential buildings served by common entryways and containing six or fewer units shall be constructed to give the appearance of a large single-family detached home.
Figure 6-30: This image demonstrates how an attached residential structure of six or fewer units can be constructed to appear as a large detached residential structure.
6) Attached residential developments with structures housing seven or more units per structure shall incorporate a variety of distinct building designs and shall be distinguished through the inclusion of a minimum of two of the following attributes:
a) A variation in length of 30 percent or more;
b) A variation in the size (square footage) of the building footprint by 30 percent or more;
c) A variation in color or in use of materials, or both;
Sec. 6.1.11.B cont.
6-20
d) A variation in the type of attached residential dwellings contained in the structure (e.g., vertically attached or horizontally stacked); or
e) A distinct variation in building height by at least 20 percent and roof form.
C. Height. Except for structures located in areas subject to the traditional standards of this ordinance (See Subsection 6.1.4.), buildings located within 100 feet of lands occupied by or designated for detached residential development shall not exceed two stories.
D. Façade Standards
1) Variation in building façade elevations shall be included on all attached residential building façades.
2) Long, monotonous, blocky, uniform, or repetitive façades shall be prohibited.
Figure 6-31: This attached residential development lacks sufficient façade variation yielding a monotonous appearance.
3) Façades facing streets or containing the primary entrance(s) to dwellings shall provide a minimum of three of the following design features for each residential unit fronting onto a street:
a) Projections or recesses in the façade plane every 30 feet (with a minimum depth of two feet);
b) Different exterior building materials and/or colors for each unit (e.g. alternating among brick, painted brick, siding, and stone);
c) One or more dormer windows or cupolas;
d) A recessed entrance;
e) A covered porch or balcony;
f) Pillars, posts, or pilasters;
g) One or more box or bay windows with a minimum twelve-inch projection from the façade plane;
h) Eaves with exposed rafters or a minimum six-inch projection from the façade plane;
i) Dormers;
j) A parapet wall with an articulated design rather than a simple rectilinear form; or
k) Multiple windows with a minimum four-inch wide trim.
Sec. 6.1.11.B cont.
6-21
Figure 6-32: These attached residential structures demonstrate how different materials, changes in wall planes, offsets, projections, recesses, and other architectural techniques can promote variety in building façades.
4) Building façades facing arterial streets shall include brick, stone, or siding (wood or fibrous cement) for a minimum of 75 percent of the net façade area.
5) Horizontal variations in materials along the façade of an attached residential building shall occur in conjunction with a change in wall plane, preferably at the inside corner of a wall.
E. Roof Forms
1) Attached residential structures shall incorporate roof pitches between 3:12 and 12:12; however, alternative roof forms or pitches may be allowed for small roof sections over porches, entryways, or similar features.
Sec. 6.1.11.D cont.
6-22
Figure 6-33: This image illustrates the difference between the maximum 12:12 roof pitch (top) and the minimum 3:12 roof pitch (bottom).
2) Parapet walls fronting a street shall include three-dimensional cornice treatments.
3) Roof forms shall be designed to correspond and denote building elements and functions such as entrances and arcades.
Figure 6-34: Roof forms can be used to denote building features such as entrances. Parapet walls can add visual interest through the use of a three-dimensional cornice treatment.
F. Off-Street Surface Parking. In addition to the standards in Section 6.9, Off-Street Parking and Loading, attached residential structures shall comply with the following:
1) No off-street surface parking shall be located between the structure and the street it fronts.
2) Off-street surface parking located on the side of a building shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the lots street frontage along the primary street. In making that calculation, associated driving areas and driveways shall be included as part of such off-street surface parking.
Sec. 6.1.11.E cont.
6-23
Figure 6-35: Off-street surface parking lots located to the rear of a structure allow an active and cohesive streetscape to be maintained.
G. Garage Standards. Attached and detached garages and carports shall comply with the following standards:
1) Garages and car ports serving attached residential structures shall be located to the side or rear of such buildings and shall be oriented perpendicular to the primary streets located around the perimeter of the development.
Figure 6-36: Garages serving attached residential structures must be oriented perpendicular to the primary streets serving the development to minimize their visual impact.
2) The Zoning Official may allow attached residential structures to include garage doors that face the primary street fronting the structure only in cases where it is necessary to retain existing vegetation or address difficult topography.
3) An attached or detached garage shall not project beyond the front of the primary façade of the dwelling it serves.
H. Streetscape Elements. Streetscape elements (e.g., benches, trash receptacles, light fixtures, bollards, fountains, bicycle racks, etc.) included within an attached residential development shall be compatible with the architectural features of the structures, and shall help to establish a unifying theme throughout the site.
Sec. 6.1.11.F cont.
6-24
6.1.12. Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Development. Except where specifically exempted, commercial, office, institutional, industrial, and mixed-use structures and sites shall comply with the following standards:
A. Orientation
1) Traditional Zones
a) The primary façade of a building shall be parallel to the street it fronts.
b) The building side containing the primary entrance shall be oriented towards the street. Buildings in Traditional Zones often have multiple entrances, including those to other streets and parking areas.
Figure 6-37: Buildings are more pedestrian-oriented when primary entrances are located adjacent to the sidewalk or street instead of to surface parking lots.
c) In the case of multi-building developments, the primary entrances of buildings shall be oriented in towards a street along the perimeter of the development, towards streets interior of the development, or towards formal open space (e.g., civic spaces or plazas).
d) Primary entrances shall not be oriented towards off-street surface parking lots.
e) Parking lots shall be oriented to the side and rear of the building.
f) Nothing in this section shall prevent corner entrances to buildings, or buildings with entrances facing both a primary street and a parking lot.
g) Developments with parking in the rear may add appropriate directional signage guiding the traveling public to said parking.
6-25
Figure 6-38: As a means of promoting pedestrian orientation and maintaining neighborhood scale and character, surface parking areas serving nonresidential or mixed-uses in traditional zones are located to the side or rear of the structure.
2) Conventional Zones
a) The primary façade of a building shall be parallel to the street they front unless an alternate orientation is consistent with existing adjacent development.
b) The primary entrances of buildings shall be oriented:
(i) Towards a street along the perimeter of the development;
(ii) Towards streets in the interior of the development;
(iii) Towards a formal open space (e.g., civic spaces, plazas) inside the development.
(iv) Towards a primary drive aisle designed in accordance with Section 6.9, Off-Street Parking and Loading; or
(v) Towards a parking lot, located between the building and street along the perimeter of the development.
c) Except for the M-1 and M-2 districts and properties fronting major arterial roadways, the following shall apply:
(i) In parking lots of 100 parking spaces or less, parking lots located between the building and street along the perimeter of the development shall not exceed 60 feet in width (typically one aisle with two single-loaded bays).
(ii) In parking lots of more than 100 parking spaces, parking lots located between the building and street along the perimeter of the development shall not exceed more than 180 feet in width.
d) The width of parking lots shall be designed per Subsection 6.3(9), Off-Street Parking Location.
Sec. 6.1.12.A cont.
6-26
Figure 6-39: For lots of 100 parking spaces or less, limiting surface parking to a maximum width of 60 feet in front of a building helps to mitigate the visual impact of surface parking lots.
B. Setbacks. Setbacks shall be in accordance with Article 4, Traditional Zone Regulations, or Article 5, Conventional Zone Regulations, based on the applicable building type and standards.
C. Building Façades. Building façades shall comply with the following standards:
1) Rear and side façades, if visible from public streets, shall have a similar architectural treatment as used on the primary or front façade;
2) Blank building walls facing streets are prohibited;
3) Buildings shall have a defined base and cap; and
4) Remote walls that are not visible from a street and only visible from an alley, the rear yard of another nonresidential or mixed-use site, or completely hidden due to topography or natural features preserved in an open space lot shall be exempt from these requirements.
Sec. 6.1.12.A cont.
6-27
Figure 6-40: This building successfully blends the vertical height of the building with the horizontal banding of the base, middle, and cap.
5) Window and door openings shall have a vertical orientation and shall be vertically aligned between floors.
6) Within Traditional Zones, buildings shall be constructed (through the use of materials, design elements, or architectural details) to emphasize the proportion of height to width so that building façades are vertically oriented.
Figure 6-41: This image depicts a building with an orientation that is primarily horizontal, which is inappropriate for Traditional zones in Athens.
7) Where a clearly established development character and scale exist, new infill development shall include:
a) Window and door openings with area ratios and proportions similar to those on adjoining buildings; and
Sec. 6.1.12.C cont.
6-28
b) Key design elements of surrounding buildings with respect to windows, doors, rhythm of bays, detailing, roof forms, materials, and colors.
Figure 6-42: This building demonstrates successful integration as an infill structure into an existing context.

3) Create a linked network of open spaces;
4) Promote existing rural character within agricultural and rural areas; and
5) Provide reasonable economic use of the property.
B. Procedure. Development of a Conservation Subdivision shall require T-PUD or C-PUD zoning and shall be subject to the procedures and standards for Required Development Plan in Subsection 2.5.2. All additional design requirements for the development beyond the minimum standards of this Ordinance shall be noted on the master development plan. Once the development plan is approved and the PUD zoning affixed to the property, the developer will then proceed through the subdivision process outlined in the adopted Subdivision Regulations.
6.1.14. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND)
A. Purpose and Intent. Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) is a voluntary development arrangement that uses design in the tradition of small American villages and neighborhoods that flourished during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These standards are intended to create developments including the following elements:
Sec. 6.1.12.K cont.
6-36
1) A mix of residential and neighborhood-serving nonresidential uses;
2) A focus on street character through use of front porches and gardens;
3) A sensitive approach to the design and location of off-street parking and service areas;

A. Appeal of Design Standards
1) Design modifications may only be granted by the Planning Commission to the development standards of Chapter 6 Building and Site Design Standards as part of the Development Plan, or Site Plan review process, when such exceptions will enhance the appearance and design of commercial and multiple-family development and other development subject to review.
2) An applicant may request a design modification for developments in order to achieve a more desirable site development than would result if the requirements of this ordinance were strictly adhered to. Design modifications may be granted under the provisions of subsection B, below.
3) Generally, design modifications are limited to minor changes of the provisions set forth in Chapter 6.
4) No design modification shall be granted under this section that would impact overall bulk lot requirements: for example, decrease the landscape surface ratio, decrease the number of required parking spaces, decrease the amount of required on-site landscape material, or decrease the required open space.
B. Findings. A request for design modification shall be submitted in writing by the applicant along with the initial filing of a plan. The request shall state fully the grounds for the request and all of the facts upon which the applicant is relying. The Planning Commission shall not grant a design modification unless it is found that the applicant has presented sufficient justification and documentation that:
1) The design modification will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
2) The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the design intent for the development which the design modifications are sought and are not applicable generally to other property;
3) The design modification is necessary because of the particular design intent of the development, which would not be achievable if strict adherence to these requirements was carried out; and
6-37
4) The design modification will not vary the provisions of the Athens Land Use Plan.
C. Conditions. In granting design modifications, reasonable conditions or restrictions may be imposed if appropriate or necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, or convenience, and to secure the purposes of this ordinance.
D. Application Review and Action. Applications for a design modification exception shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Athens Planning Commission.

2) Adjacent to Buffers or Streetscape Landscape Areas. Perimeter landscape strips associated with a vehicular use area shall not be required if the vehicle use area is contiguous to a required buffer and the screening intent of this chapter is met.
6.2.6. Buffers
A. Purpose. Landscape buffers are intended for use when the impacts of incompatible uses cannot be mitigated through design compatibility concepts or transitional features.
B. The following types of separation buffers are hereby established (see figure 6-54) and are required where noted on Table 6-1.
1) Type A - Solid wall with exterior landscaping. (8 minimum width) This buffer can be used to minimize the width of the separation buffer while maintaining a visual and auditory separation between uses. A solid wall constructed of brick, stone, masonry, iron, wood, or products designed to resemble these materials shall be at least 6 in height (10 maximum height). A 6 wide landscape strip (minimum width) shall be located on the exterior side of the wall facing the adjacent properties. One evergreen tree shall be installed for every 4 linear feet of wall. One understory or ornamental tree can be substituted for every 4th evergreen, provided the tree is a minimum of 8 tall and 3 in caliper.
2) Type B - Planting Screen. (15 minimum width) At maturity, intended to be a completely visually opaque barrier. At a minimum, 3 staggered rows of evergreen trees spaced 5 on center from one another shall fill the entire length of the buffer. The vegetation used shall be designed to grow to a minimum height of 8 - 10 feet.
3) Type C - Semitransparent Greenspace. (25 minimum width) A wide buffer designed to provide limited visual permeability between uses. At a minimum, the buffer shall contain trees planted at a maximum of 40 on center from one another.
C. Responsibility for Buffer Installation
1) Vacant Parcels. Where a developing parcel is adjacent to a vacant parcel zoned for incompatible uses, the developing parcel shall provide 50 percent of the perimeter buffer required adjacent to the vacant land.
2) Existing Land Uses
a) Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing use, the developing parcel shall provide the full perimeter buffer required adjacent to the existing use.
b) Where all or part of a perimeter buffer exists on the adjacent developed parcel, but the buffer does not fully comply with the standards of this subsection, the developing parcel shall be responsible for providing all the additional planting material necessary to meet the standards of this subsection.
c) If the existing developed parcel contains a buffer meeting the standards of this subsection, then the developing use is not required to provide a buffer.
Sec. 6.2.5.C cont.
6-45
Figure 6-54: Types of buffers.
Sec. 6.2.6.C cont.
6-46
3) Adjacent to Nonconforming Sites. Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing lawfully established use that is more intense and has no buffer, then the developing use shall only be responsible for providing a maximum of 50 percent of the required landscape buffer.
D. Location of Buffers. Buffers required by this subsection shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line; however, the buffer may be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential developments.
E. Up to 25 percent of the vegetation within a buffer may be deciduous
F. Increase in Required Plantings.

d) Off-street parking areas (including those serving detached residential uses), shall be designed to accommodate the minimum number of required parking spaces without use of the public right-of-way.
e) Except within allowable on-street parking areas, in no instance shall parking or maneuvering incidental to parking (except for ingress and egress) be on a public street or sidewalk.
2) Backing onto Public Streets. All off-street parking and loading areas, except on lots used for detached residential dwellings, shall be arranged so that no vehicle shall be required to back from such facilities directly onto public streets, unless approved by the Streets Department Manager.
E. Drainage. All off-street parking and loading areas shall comply with the adopted Athens City Stormwater Management Specifications and Standards.
F. Exterior Lighting. New or redeveloped off-street parking and loading areas shall be lighted so as to prevent glare or excessive light on adjacent land, and unless exempted, shall comply with the standards of Section 6.7, Exterior Lighting. This standard does not apply to parking and loading areas serving detached residential uses.
G. Landscape. Except for parking areas on the same lot as a detached residential use, all off-street parking and loading areas shall be landscaped in accordance with Subsection 6.2.5, Vehicular Use Area Landscape.
H. Curbs and Motor Vehicle Stops. All off-street parking and loading areas shall provide curbs or similar devices to prevent vehicles from overhanging on or into public right-of-way, sidewalks, walkways, adjacent land, or landscape areas. Motor vehicle stops are permitted only for handicap spaces, in parking structures, or adjacent to stormwater features that promote infiltration.
I. Maintained in Good Repair
1) Maintained at All Times. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be maintained in good repair and in safe condition at all times so as not to constitute a hazard to public safety or a visual or aesthetic nuisance to surrounding lots.
2) Periodically Restored. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be periodically painted or otherwise maintained to retain a clear identification of separate parking stalls or loading areas.

D. Uses with Variable Parking Demand Characteristics
1) Uses that reference this subsection in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to establish a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to this subsection, the Engineering Services and Community Development shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking standards on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by Engineering Services and Community Development, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
2) In approving a parking requirement for a proposed use that is less than identified in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3, sufficient area shall be reserved in accordance with Subsection 6.5.11.D to allow for adequate parking to be installed upon a change in use or increased parking demand over time.
E. Mixed Uses. Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use shall provide parking spaces in an amount equal to the total of the standards for all individual uses. This provision shall not limit the ability to submit an Alternative Parking Plan to reduce the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces in recognition of different operating hours or peak business periods.
F. Maximum Number of Spaces Permitted. In no event shall an attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-use development provide more than 120 percent of the minimum number of parking spaces established in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, as surface spaces except through the approval of an Alternative Parking Plan. (See Subsection 6.5.11.)
1) Additional Requirements
a) Any off-street surface parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum number of off-street parking spaces required in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street
Sec. 6.5.4 cont.
6-70
Parking Standards, shall comply with the standards of Subsection 6.5.11.A, Provision over the Maximum Allowed.
b) Off-street surface parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum number of spaces shall be pervious.
G. Compact Spaces. Within lots of 20 or more spaces, up to 25 percent of the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces identified in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, may be provided as compact car spaces, provided the following standards are met:
1) Minimum Dimensions
a) Each compact car parking space shall have minimum dimensions in accordance with Figure 6-72, Dimensional Standards for Parking Spaces and Aisles;
b) The minimum width of compact spaces shall be increased to eight feet and seven inches for spaces at a 60 degree angle to the aisle serving them, and ten feet and six inches for spaces at a 45 degree angle to aisle serving them;
2) Location. Compact car parking spaces shall be located no closer to the primary building entrance than any standard parking spaces; and
3) Designated. All compact car spaces shall be designated by signage or pavement marking.
H. Placement. The location or placement of off-street parking areas on a development site shall be limited in accordance with the placement standards in Article 4, Traditional Zoning Regulations and Section 6.1, Building and Site Design Standards.
6.5.5. Computation of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces
A. Fractions. When measurements of the number of required parking spaces result in fractions, the space standard shall be rounded upward to the next highest whole number.
B. Different Use Areas. Except as provided for in this subsection, parking shall be calculated separately for each different use area in a building or on a site, including all accessory uses.
C. Combinations of Uses. If the Engineering Services and Community Development determines that a proposed use represents a combination of uses listed in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, the minimum and maximum parking space standards shall be those that would apply if the two (or more) uses were developed separately, unless the Engineering Services and Community Development determines that a lower standard would be adequate because of differences in peak operating hours.
D. On-Street Parking and Other Public Parking. Except on detached residential lots, Traditional Zones, mixed-use developments, Conservation Subdivisions, PUDs, or as part of an Alternative Parking Plan, on-street parking on streets and other public parking spaces shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards of this subsection. Except for the DWTN District, those areas and development types that do allow on-street and other public parking spaces to count towards required off-street parking requirements, said spaces must be within 250 feet of the use requiring the parking.
E. Determination by Engineering Services and Community Development
1) Parking standards for uses not specifically listed in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, shall be determined by the Engineering Services and Community Development based on the standards for the closest comparable use or by reference to standard parking resources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association.
Sec. 6.5.4.F cont.
6-71
2) The Engineering Services and Community Development may alternately require the submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.
6.5.6. Stacking Spaces for Drive-through and Related Uses. In addition to meeting the off-street parking standards in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, uses with drive-through facilities or similar auto-orientation, including, but not limited to, financial institutions, automotive service or wash facilities, restaurants with a drive through, dry cleaners, and pharmacies shall provide adequate automobile stacking spaces on site and shall be arranged so that no vehicle stacking area shall cause automobiles to queue within public rights-of-way.
6.5.7. Accessible Parking Spaces for Disabled Persons. A portion of the total number of required off-street parking spaces in each off-street parking area shall be specifically designated, located, and reserved for use by persons with physical disabilities in accordance with Table 6-4, Minimum Accessible Parking Spaces.
Table 6-4: Minimum Accessible Parking Spaces

6.5.8. Dimensional Standards for Parking Spaces and Aisles
A. General. The dimensions for standard car parking spaces and parking lot aisles shall comply with Figure 6-72, Dimensional Standards for Parking Spaces and Aisles:
B. Dimensional Adjustments. Parking structures may be subject to dimensional adjustments based on utilization, but in no case shall the standard space width be less than eight feet. Reduction in design standards shall be subject to approval by Engineering Services and Community Development Department.
C. Primary Drive Aisles. Primary drive aisles within large off-street surface parking lots of 250 or more spaces located in Conventional Zones shall be designed to appear as an extension of the public street network extending from the public right-of-way along the full length of the primary façades of structures being served by the drive. They shall also meet the following standards:
1) Primary drive aisles shall have a maximum cross section of 40 feet to serve two travel lanes and accommodate parallel parking spaces along both sides of the drive aisle in areas not needed for turning movements;
2) Primary drive aisles shall be striped to designate parallel parking spaces, where appropriate, but in no case shall parallel parking spaces be designated within 60 feet of the primary building entrance(s);

understory trees may be used adjacent to the building façade within 40 feet of building entrances.
Figure 6-73: Primary drive aisles are designed to appear as an extension of the public street network through the inclusion of sidewalks, street trees, and parallel parking spaces where appropriate.
6.5.9. Sidewalks and Pedestrian Pathways.
A. All sidewalks and pedestrian pathways within a site development shall be ADA compliant and meet the standard specifications for construction adopted by the City.
B. Surface parking lots containing 250 or more surface parking spaces shall provide at least one paved pedestrian pathway with a minimum width of five feet to the primary entrance of the building(s) being served by the parking lot. The pedestrian pathway shall be located within a landscaping island and shall serve to connect the primary building entrance with the sidewalk system around the site. The pedestrian pathway shall use alternative materials or contrasting color when crossing a drive aisle.
6.5.10. Bicycle Facilities. Developments with surface parking areas with 50 or more spaces shall provide bicycle parking facilities, which shall comply with the following standards:
A. Location. Bicycle parking spaces shall be conveniently located, but in no case shall such facilities be located farther than one hundred linear feet from the primary building entrance;
B. Number of Spaces. Bicycle parking spaces shall be provided at the following rates:
1) On lots within Traditional Zones, one bicycle parking space per every ten off-street parking spaces; and
2) On lots within Conventional Zones, one bicycle parking space per every 20 off-street parking spaces.
C. Securing Device. Include a rack or other device to enable bicycles to be secured.
6.5.11. Alternative Parking Plan. The DRT shall be authorized to approve an Alternative Parking Plan that proposes alternatives to providing the number and configuration of off-street parking spaces required by Section 6.5 and Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, in accordance with the standards listed below. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the use of one or more of the following off-street parking alternatives by a single use. If
Sec. 6.5.8.C cont.

B. Number of Required Off-street Loading Berths. The minimum number of loading spaces or berths shall be provided on-site for all developments specified in Table 6-5, Loading and Unloading Requirements, depending on the use or its gross floor area. The applicant may provide a greater number of spaces than those required by this subsection.
Sec. 6.5.11.H cont.
6-78
Table 6-5 - Number of Required Off-street Loading Berths
C. Standards
1) Minimum Dimensions
a) Except for industrial uses, each loading berth or space required by this subsection shall be at least 12 feet wide by 25 feet long (or deep), with at least 14 feet of overhead clearance. Each off-street loading space shall have adequate, unobstructed means for the ingress and egress of vehicles.
b) Industrial uses shall provide loading berths at least 12 feet wide and 55 feet long, with at least 14 feet of overhead clearance.
2) Location. Within Traditional Zones, loading areas shall be located to the rear of the use they serve. In addition, the loading area shall be located adjacent to the buildings loading doors, in an area that promotes their practical use.
3) Delineation of Loading Spaces. All loading spaces shall be delineated by signage and striping and labeling of the pavement.
4) Access to a Street. All loading areas shall be provided with safe and convenient access to a street, but in no case shall the loading space extend into the required aisle of the parking lot.
5) Paving. The ground surface of loading areas shall be paved with a durable, dust-free and hard material such as surface and seal treatment, bituminous hot mix or Portland cement, concrete, or some comparable material. Such paving shall be maintained for safe and convenient use at all times.
§6.6. Mobility and Circulation
6.6.1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose for this section is to establish mobility and circulation standards that treat alternative modes of travel (including walking) with the same degree of importance as that afforded to motor vehicles. This section is intended to:
A. Provide safe, efficient, and convenient vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access and circulation patterns within and between developments;
B. Foster a pedestrian-friendly distribution of land uses and street network;
Sec. 6.5.12 cont.
6-79
C. Create a safe, continuous network of pedestrian walkways within and between developments;
D. Reduce interference with through traffic by other vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians entering, leaving, and crossing streets;
E. Establish a pedestrian network that offers clear circulation paths from the parking areas to building entries that creates a friendlier, more inviting image;
F. Assure safe access to and from streets by emergency vehicles; and
G. Establish a requirement for the preparation of a Circulation Plan that addresses transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and vehicular circulation both within a development and with surrounding developments.
6.6.2. Applicability. The standards in this section shall apply to development on all lots in the city, as well as to public and private street rights-of-way.
6.6.3. Development Standards for Sidewalks. All sidewalks and pedestrian pathways within a development shall be ADA compliant and meet the standard specifications for construction adopted by the City.
6.6.4. Circulation Plan Required
A. Applicants for a developmental subdivision and large scale developments shall prepare a Circulation Plan.
B. The Circulation Plan shall address street connectivity, emergency and service vehicle access, parking movements, accommodation of loading operations, turning radii, traffic calming measures where future cut-through traffic is likely, and similar issues.
C. The DRT may waive the requirement for a Circulation Plan on a case-by-case basis in the event that a new development has no impact upon circulation or proposes no change in existing circulation patterns. This provision shall not be construed to exempt development that includes additional parking, driveways, or substantial modifications to the existing pedestrian network.
D. A Circulation Plan shall be submitted with the Concept Plan, Preliminary Plat, Final Plat, Site Plan, or Development Plan.
E. Traffic Impact Analysis. As a part of the required Circulation Plan, the City Engineer may require, at no cost to the city, a traffic impact study to be prepared in accordance with the standards set in the Athens Traffic Circulation Standards.
6.6.5. Connectivity
A. Internal Street Connectivity
1) Circulation Plans for development on lots in the Traditional Zone shall provide for multiple connections to the existing city street network wherever possible.
2) Except for lots within the Traditional Zone, Circulation Plans prepared for all new development shall maintain internal street connectivity through the use of a connectivity index, in accordance with the following standards:
a) All development shall achieve a connectivity index score of 1.65 or greater;
b) The connectivity index for a development is calculated by dividing its links by its nodes. Nodes (stars) exist at street intersections and cul-de-sac heads within the development. Links (circles) are stretches of road that connect nodes. Street stub-outs are considered as links, but temporary dead-end streets internal to a development, private streets in gated sections, or alleys shall not be counted as
Sec. 6.6.1 cont.
6-80
links. One link beyond every node that exists in the development and provides access to the street network shall be included in the index calculation.
Figure 6-75: This figure provides an example of how to calculate the connectivity index. In the diagram, there are 36 links (circles) and 21 nodes (stars); therefore the connectivity index is 1.71 (36/21 = 1.71). In addition, each side of the development includes at least one street stub or connection to the greater street system every 1,500 feet.
c) The connectivity index standard of 1.65 or greater may be reduced by the DRT if the owner/developer demonstrates it is impossible or impracticable to achieve due to topographic conditions, natural features, or adjacent existing development patterns. If an applicant disagrees with the decision of the DRT, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission or the Council (depending upon the type of application).
d) Whenever cul-de-sac streets are created, at least one eight-foot-wide pedestrian access/public utility easement shall be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, between each cul-de-sac head or street turnaround and the sidewalk system of the closest adjacent street or pedestrian sidewalk or pathway.
e) Temporary dead end streets terminating at the perimeter of a development shall be counted as a link. In no case shall a temporary dead end street terminating at a point internal to the development be counted as a link.
3) Gated Streets. Gated streets, or sections of neighborhoods with gated private streets, are permitted provided the development achieves and maintains the minimum connectivity index score in Subsection (2) above. Private streets are to be built to City standards and inspected prior to final approval.
Sec. 6.6.5.A cont.
6-81
Figure 6-76: Pedestrian accessways from cul-de-sac heads to the larger pedestrian system help preserve pedestrian connectivity where street connections cannot be made.
B. External Street Connectivity. In addition to the internal street connectivity requirements, Circulation Plans for all new development, except for lots within the Traditional Zone, shall maintain external street connectivity in accordance with the following standards:
1) The arrangement of streets in a development shall provide for the alignment and continuation of existing or proposed streets into adjoining lands in those cases in which the (a) adjoining lands are undeveloped and intended for future development or (b) in which the adjoining lands are developed and include opportunities for such connections, unless it is determined that the public benefit to be achieved by the new developments external street connectivity and the citys overall policy objectives favoring connectivity are significantly outweighed by (i) the undesireable negative impacts on traffic and/or safety, (ii) the reasonable opposition of owners/residents of the new development and the adjoining lands, (iii) or the strong likelihood of the use of minor streets for through streets. Where external street connectivity is required, traffic calming measures shall be integrated into the development to mitigate the impact of potential future cut-through traffic.
2) Street rights-of-way shall be extended to or along adjoining property boundaries such that a roadway connection or street stub shall be provided for development at least every 1,500 feet for each direction (north, south, east, and west) in which development abuts vacant lands. Such street stubs shall not be required to abut adjacent development lacking existing or planned street connections, floodplains, wetlands, riparian buffers, slopes exceeding 14 percent, other unique site conditions preventing a street connection with the determination of the DRT, or in situations where external connectivity is not required by subsection 6.6.5.B.1.
Sec. 6.6.5 cont.
6-82
3) Residential streets affected by external street connectivity requirements may be candidates for traffic calming treatments upon the recommendation of the Engineering Department.

4) Street and sidewalk connections shall be made between neighborhood commercial centers and adjacent residential neighborhoods.
5) Shared commercial/residential connections with arterials shall be primarily oriented towards commercial centers.
6) At all locations where streets terminate with no street connection, but a future connection is planned or accommodated, a sign shall be installed by the City at the developers expense at the temporary street stub with the words STREET TO BE EXTENDED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF ATHENS to inform property owners.
7) The Final Subdivision Plat and the deeds for all residential dwellings shall identify all stub streets and include a notation that all street stubs are intended for connection with future streets on adjoining undeveloped property.
(Ord. No. 2019-2079, § 7 adopted 2019-04-22)
C. Cross Access Between Adjacent Uses. To encourage shared parking and shared access points on public streets, circulation plans prepared for all new attached residential, nonresidential, and mixed-use development shall comply with the following standards:
1) Except on lots within the M-1 and M-2 Districts, internal vehicular circulation areas shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent lots with attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-uses.
2) A stub for future cross access shall be provided from the vehicular use area to all adjacent vacant land designated for attached residential, nonresidential, or mixed-uses.
3) A minimum distance of 40 feet shall be required between a cross-access way and driveway entrance apron.
4) Cross-access ways shall allow for two-way traffic between parcels through the use of a single drive aisle with a minimum width of 22 feet or through two one-way aisles each with a minimum width of 11 feet. The maximum median separation width shall be 15 feet with a left-turn pocket or four feet without a left-turn pocket.
5) When cross-access is determined to be impractical by the DRT on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, the requirement for cross-access may be waived if appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses. If an applicant disagrees with the determination of the DRT, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission or Council, depending on the type of application.
6) A cross-access easement must be recorded prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the development.
Sec. 6.6.5.B cont.

A. Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a signs face is expressed in square footage calculated from the total perimeter of the writing, display of color or any background material included in the signs design, and encompasses all the signs graphic components and symbols. The area calculation will be based on a combination of circles, rectangles, squares, triangles, etc., as appropriate. The signs face is differentiated from the backdrop or structure to which it is fixed, and does not include the supporting framework, bracing, or wall which supports the sign face. If a signs components, such as complete words, phrases, and graphics are proposed for a façade without being attached to a singular cabinet or background, the area of said components may be calculated separately. Individual characters shall not be calculated independently from one another.
B. Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
C. Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at grade level to the top of the highest attached component of the sign, including border, trim, frame, supports, and all other structural members and appurtenances.

§7.4. Deferred Improvements Program. The City recognizes that there are occasionally unique circumstances, typically where small, start-up businesses are concerned, where required improvements are to a scale that makes obtaining a bond or letter of credit, and frontloading a project with capital investment for all required improvements is unduly burdensome. It is the intent of this section to offer an alternative means of getting site improvements constructed while being cognizant of the challenges faced by start-up, small businesses. This section shall only apply where the applicant is seeking to locate within an existing building and nonconforming improvements are required by Sec. 3.7 if this ordinance.
7.4.1. Program Standards. The City, at its discretion, shall be free to offer an applicant the opportunity to defer improvements to a property according to the following:
A. The applicant has a site plan drawn by a professional engineer or landscape architect.
B. The engineer or landscape architect develops a schedule for required improvements set over the course of time set in this section.
C. The schedule for improvements, with associated percentages of the total cost of improvements, shall be as follows:
1) 25% of the total improvements are due at the time a Certificate of Occupancy is issued.
2) 50% of the total improvements shall be in place one (1) year following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
3) 75% of the total improvements shall be in place two (2) years following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
4) 100% of the total improvements shall be in place three (3) years following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
D. The applicant shall enter into a contract with the City, agreeing to the terms of this section and ensuring that 100% of the required improvements are made within the course of time set by this section. Within the contract, the applicant will agree that the issuance of a City business privilege license for their business is contingent on their meeting the obligations of this section.
7.4.2. Alternative Program for Deferred Parking. An applicant may submit a request to defer the construction of up to 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces specified in Table 6-2, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, or Table 6-3, Off-Street parking Standards for Selected Industrial Uses, if the request complies with the following standards:
1) Reserve Parking Plan. The request is accompanied by a Reserve Parking Plan identifying: (a) the amount of off-street parking being deferred, and (b) the location of the area to be reserved for future parking, if needed, and (c) spaces are drawn to show how it could be built to meet parking standards including dimensional, accessibility requirements, grading, drainage, lighting, landscaping, signage, and all other requirements for a site plan.
2) Parking Demand Study. Adequate assurance is provided that within 12 months after the initial Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the proposed development, the applicant will submit a Parking Demand Study to the Engineering Services and Community Development that demonstrates the parking demand for the development and the adequacy of existing parking spaces. If the study indicates that the existing parking is adequate, then the construction of the remaining number of parking spaces
7-4
shall not be required. If the study indicates additional parking is required, it shall be provided consistent with the Reserve Parking Plan and the standards of Section 6.5, Off-Street Parking and Loading.
3) Limitations on Reserve Areas. Areas reserved for future parking shall be brought to the finished grade and shall not be used for buildings, storage, loading, or other purposes.
4) Landscape Required. If ultimately developed for off-street parking purposes, areas reserved for future parking shall be landscaped with an appropriate ground cover and shall comply with all relevant landscape standards of this ordinance.
5) Total required handicap parking is developed in the initial phase.
B. The applicant shall enter into a contract with the City, agreeing to the terms of this section and ensuring that 100% of the required improvements are made and appropriate ancillary information/materials/reports are provided within the course of time set by this section. Within the contract, the applicant will agree that the issuance of a City business privilege license for their business is contingent on their meeting the obligations of this section.
7.4.3. Failure to meet obligations. Any failure to meet the obligations of this section shall result in the revocation of the business City business privilege license.
7.4.4. Business failure. In the event that a business does not survive the length of time set in the contract, and required improvements were not made, the property will be considered nonconforming.
§7.5. Maintenance. Upon the release of the Performance Agreement, the applicant shall be required to maintain the completed improvements and required landscape to insure against defects in workmanship and materials.
§7.6. Failure to Complete Improvements. The Engineering Services and Community Development may declare the agreement to be in default and notify the Planning Commission of the need to call the agreement and surety in accordance with Section 2.4, Specific Development Review Procedures.
