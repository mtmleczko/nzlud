PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through October 16, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 22 is 22-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-2 and 1-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-2.1, 1-2.2 and 1-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 3 and 4, it will be designated as Chapter 3.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Mr. Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John E. Hayes, City Attorney, and Ms. Wanda Sang, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Prefatory Synopsis

Preamble 
PREFATORY SYNOPSIS 
    On November 2, 1976, the citizens of Wheat Ridge voted for the creation of a Home Rule Charter Commission and selected a diversified group of citizens to draft a proposed Charter. The twenty-one (21) elected members of the Charter Commission submit to the voters of the City their proposed Home Rule Charter which has been framed in conformity with article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado and the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1971. 
    The commission members have drafted a Charter to achieve a simple and direct form of local government based upon sound principles. It is designed to meet the present and future needs of the citizens of Wheat Ridge. The underlying concept of this document is the need for a flexible and responsive government with maximum financial control exercised by the citizens. Such a philosophy emphasizes public involvement and encourages citizen participation in matters of local and municipal concern. The commission believes that this charter provides for effective government through local self-determination by separating legislative and administrative branches. 
    The charter provides for the Council-Manager form of government. The mayor presides over council meetings and possesses the power of veto. The mayor shall be the recognized head of the city government for all legal and ceremonial purposes and shall be the conservator of the peace. 
    The city council is established as the policy-making legislative body of the city. The council consists of eight (8) members with two (2) members elected from each of four (4) districts. The council shall appoint citizens to all boards and commissions on an equal representation basis. 
    The charter provides that all elections are to be nonpartisan and conducted in accordance with Colorado Municipal Election Law. All city officials are elected for a two-year term of office thereby providing maximum accountability to the citizens. The treasurer and city clerk remain elected officers of the city. The city council also appoints a city manager to run the daily affairs of the city. 
    The rights of the people have been retained through powers of recall, initiative and referendum. Significant tax limitations existing under present state law also are incorporated into this charter. 
    The proposed charter is a document of consensus and compromise. The significant consideration is the charter itself and there is no substitute for reading it in its entirety. 
(Ord. No. 1996-1038, § 1, 7-22-96) 
PREAMBLE 
    We, the people of the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, under the authority of the Constitution of the State of Colorado and in order to exercise the rights, privileges and responsibilities of self-government granted to use by the said Constitution, do ordain and establish this home rule charter for the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

The city clerk shall, within forty-eight (48) hours after the filing of said affidavit, mail a copy by registered mail to the elective officer sought to be recalled, who may file with the city clerk a sworn statement in defense of the charges made against him.

All petitions and procedures shall be in conformance with the other provisions of elections in this Charter.

(As amended 7-12-83. Effective upon adoption 7-12-83) 
Sec. 5.10.1. - Building height and density limitations. 
(a)  Height limitations. The city shall not, by ordinance, resolution, motion, permit, or other action, or variance except as provided in subsection (e), allow the construction of buildings or other structures which exceed the following maximum heights: 
(1)  Thirty-five (35) feet for the following: All residential, planned residential and agricultural districts, including any created after passage of this amendment; residential buildings when built in nonresidential districts; the hospital-one district; and the restricted commercial-one district. 
(2)  Fifty (50) feet for the following: Any other commercial, planned commercial, industrial or planned industrial districts; the public buildings and facilities district; commercial and office buildings constructed in the hospital-two district; and any nonresidential district created after passage of this amendment. 
(3)  Sixty-five (65) feet, but in no event more than six (6) stories above grade, for new hospitals in the hospital-two district, on a minimum lot area of fifty (50) acres; however, additions attached to existing hospitals in this district may be built to a height not to exceed the height of the existing building. 
The height limitations established shall not apply to the following: Church steeples, silos, decorative domes and cupolas not used for human occupancy or any commercial, business or industrial use, nor to windmills, chimneys, ventilators, transmission towers, solar heating and cooling devices, water towers, antennas, or necessary mechanical appurtenances normally carried above the roofline, but the city council may, by ordinance, establish height limitations for these structures. 
(b)  Density Limitations. The city shall not, by ordinance, resolution, motion, variance, permit or other action, allow the construction of residential buildings in any zone district which exceed a maximum of twenty-one (21) family units per acre, except that nursing homes shall not be required to meet this density maximum. In order that land required to support a previous building permit not be used again as a means of circumventing the above maximum, the following shall apply: No subdivision, variance, rezoning or permit shall be approved or granted on said land which subtracts the supporting land and thereby leaves the existing building nonconforming by these standards. The maximum of twenty-one (21) units per acre shall apply to the total parcel, including both existing and proposed construction. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Height: The vertical distance measured from the average elevation of the finished grade of the building to the highest point of the roof surface if a flat roof, to the deck line of a mansard roof, and to the mean height level between eaves and ridge for a gable, hip, gambrel or other roof. 
(2)  Residential: Intended for human occupancy, including homes for the aged and nursing homes, but excluding hospitals, and motels and hotels for transient occupancy. 
(3)  Family unit: One (1) or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption, or no more than three (3) unrelated persons living together as a single housekeeping unit. This definition is intended to be utilized and applied only as a standard for computing maximum density in new, multiunit construction; it shall not, unless reenacted as a portion of the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws, be utilized for any purpose except density computations under this Charter section. If a single housekeeping unit is designed for the use of more than three (3) unrelated persons, such as, but not limited to, the handicapped or elderly, each three (3) persons in any such unit shall constitute one (1) family unit. 
(d)  Nonconforming structures. This amendment applies only to new construction; buildings and other structures legally in existence at the time of passage of this amendment shall not become nonconforming because of the adoption of these new density and height limits. 
(e)  Variances. The board of adjustment shall have the power to interpret terms and definitions in this amendment, and to allow a variance to maximum height, not to exceed ten (10) percent, upon a finding that not granting the variance would cause an extreme hardship. The city council and other boards may not grant variances from these standards, but nothing in this amendment shall be construed to limit the council from imposing more stringent height and density standards in any zoning district. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 5.10.1, the limitations upon building height and residential density contained herein shall not apply within the following areas of the city: (1) that area described in the Wheat Ridge Town Center Project Urban Renewal Plan, adopted December 14, 1981 and amended by Resolution 13-2001 on April 23, 2001, specifically as diagramed in Exhibits 1 and 2 and described in Exhibit 3 of said resolution, and (2) that area described in the Wadsworth Boulevard Corridor Redevelopment Plan, adopted October 22, 2001, without modifying any current zoning on any property and preserving existing height and density limitations in the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws unless and until modified through future ordinances approved by city council after public hearings. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 5.10.1, the limitations upon building height and residential density contained herein shall not apply within the following areas of the city: (1) that area described in the West 44th Avenue/Ward Road redevelopment plan, adopted October 22, 2001, and (2) that area described in the I-70/Kipling Corridors Urban Renewal Plan, adopted August 10, 2009, excluding therefrom all properties in the plan area along the Kipling Street Corridor South of 44th Avenue and all properties in the plan area east of Interstate 70, North of 32nd Avenue, west of Ward Road and south of the WEST 44th Avenue/Ward Road Redevelopment Plan Area, without modifying any current zoning on any property and preserving existing height and density limitations in the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws unless and until modified through future ordinances approved by city council after public hearings.

Sec. 5.13. - Emergency ordinances. 
    Emergency ordinances for the immediate preservation of public property, health, peace, or safety shall be approved only by the majority vote of councilmembers present at the meeting. The facts showing such urgency and need shall be specifically stated in the measure itself. No ordinance making a grant of any special privilege, levying taxes, or fixing rates charged by any city-owned utility shall ever be passed as an emergency measure. An emergency ordinance shall require passage at one (1) meeting of the council. However, neither a public hearing nor a first publication as provided in section 5.12 shall be required. An emergency ordinance shall take effect upon final passage. Publication shall be within ten (10) days after passage, or as soon thereafter as possible. An emergency ordinance shall not be in effect longer than ninety (90) days after passage, and shall not again be passed as an emergency ordinance. 
Sec. 5.14. - Veto by mayor. 
    The mayor shall have the power to veto any ordinance passed by the council subject to the following: 
(a)  Every ordinance passed by the council shall be presented to the mayor within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter. If he approves such ordinance he shall sign it within three (3) days after receiving it. 
(b)  The mayor must exercise the power of veto with a complete written explanation of the reasons therefor addressed and delivered to each councilmember within seven (7) days from the date of its final passage.

(e)  The mayor shall not have veto power on any emergency ordinance. 
Sec. 5.15. - Codification of ordinances. 
    The council shall cause the ordinances to be codified and thereafter maintained in current form. Revisions to the codes may be accomplished by reference as provided in section 5.16. 
Sec. 5.16. - Standard codes adopted by reference. 
    Standard codes, promulgated by the federal government, the State of Colorado, or by any agency of either of them, or by any municipality within the State of Colorado, or by any recognized trade or professional organization, or amendments or revisions thereof, may be adopted by reference; provided the publication of the ordinances adopting any said code shall advise that copies are available for inspection at the office of the city clerk, and provided that any penalty clause in any code may be adopted only if set forth in full and published in the adopting ordinance. 
Sec. 5.17. - Severability of ordinances. 
    Unless an ordinance shall expressly provide to the contrary, if any portion of an ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of the ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application, provided such remaining portions or applications are not determined by the court to be inoperable, and to this end ordinances are declared to be severable. 
Sec. 5.18. - Disposition of ordinances. 
    A true copy of every ordinance, as adopted by the council or electorate, shall be numbered and recorded in the official records of the city. Its adoption and publication shall be authenticated by the signatures of the mayor or mayor pro tempore, and the city clerk and by the certificate of publication. The failure to record, or authenticate any ordinance shall not, however, invalidate, suspend, or void such ordinance. 
Sec. 5.19. - Public records. 
    All public records of the City of Wheat Ridge shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times in accordance with state statutes existing at the present time or hereafter enacted or hereafter amended by ordinance adopted pursuant to this Charter. 
Sec. 5.20. - Street width designation. 
    The city council shall have the sole authority and responsibility to determine the width of all city streets within the boundaries of the City of Wheat Ridge. Such authority and responsibility cannot be delegated to any other body or individual(s), the only exception being the election procedure specifically set forth in this Charter section. Street width shall be determined by the flowline of the street. Flowline is defined as the measurement from the inside edge of one (1) curb to the inside edge of the opposite curb. Where no curb is planned to be constructed, flowline shall be defined as the measurement from the outside edge of one (1) side of the driving surface of the street, to the outside edge of the opposite side of the driving surface of the street. 
    Within one (1) year prior to construction or reconstruction of a street, the city council shall hold a public hearing to determine the flowline of such street. Following the public hearing, the council shall adopt such flowline as the street's official street width designation. 
    In the event of a protest against such proposed street width designation signed by the owners of: 
(1)  Twenty (20) percent of the property immediately adjacent or contiguous to either side of such street; or 
(2)  Ten (10) percent of the property lying within three hundred (300) feet of either side of such street, 
such proposed street width designation shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the entire city council. Property does not need to be entirely contained within the three hundred (300) foot area to be used in the computation of the ten (10) percent necessary to file a protest. Only the portion of the property that actually lies within the three hundred (300) foot area is used to compute the ten (10) percent required to file a protest. Where the City of Wheat Ridge owns property or has right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of either side of the street, then such city-owned land or right-of-way shall be excluded from the computation of the required percentage of properties needed to file a protest to the proposed street width designation. Owners of noncity land shall be considered immediately adjacent or contiguous to the street, or within three hundred (300) feet of either side of such street, despite such intervening city-owned land or right-of-way. 
    The written protest to such proposed street width designation shall be submitted to the city council no later than the conclusion of the public hearing on the proposed street width designation. At least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper used by the city to publish legal notices, and notice of such public hearing shall be mailed by certified letter to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of both sides of such street. 
    Said notice shall contain: 
(1)  A description of the proposed street width designation and a statement that the specific plans for the proposed street width designation are available for inspection at the Wheat Ridge Municipal Building; and 
(2)  An explanation of the right of the property owners to protest such proposed street width designation, and how to exercise such right; and 
(3)  The full and complete text of this Charter section. 
All publication and notification requirements set forth in this Charter section shall be performed by the city clerk. 
    If at any time within forty-five (45) days after a favorable vote by city council of such proposed street width designation, a petition signed by at least five (5) percent of the registered electors of the city council district(s) immediately adjacent or contiguous to such street be presented to the council against the going into effect of such proposed street width designation; the same shall thereupon be immediately suspended and the council shall publish notice of and call an election upon the proposed street width designation. Said election shall be held not less than thirty (30) days nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days after publication of the notice thereof. 
    Only registered electors in the city council district(s) immediately adjacent or contiguous to such street shall be eligible to vote on the proposed street width designation. If a majority of the registered electors in the city council district(s) immediately adjacent or contiguous to such street voting thereon vote for such proposed street width designation, the proposed street width designation shall be deemed approved. For purposes of ballot tabulation, the total votes of all electors who cast ballots from one or more city council district(s) shall be counted together. 
    If any provision of this Charter section or the application in any particular case, is held invalid, the remainder of this Charter section and its application in all other cases shall remain unimpaired. Anything in the Charter or ordinances of the City of Wheat Ridge in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter section is hereby declared to be inapplicable to the matters and things covered and provided for by this Charter section. This Charter section shall take effect immediately upon passage.

If the petition is insufficient, the clerk shall forthwith in writing notify one (1) or more of the persons designated as filing the same on the petition. The petition may then be amended within ten (10) days from the filing of the certificate. The city clerk, within five (5) working days after such amendment, shall make the examination of the amended petition and attach thereto a certificate of the result. If still insufficient, the clerk shall return the petition to one (1) of the persons designated thereon as filing it, without prejudice to the filing of a new petition for the same purpose, but such petition shall not be refiled within one (1) year after return by the clerk.

Such a clause is valid and enforceable, any provision of state law to the contrary notwithstanding.

The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the plan and make its recommendations to the city council. The city council shall adopt and approve the master plan after holding public hearing and shall authorize the city clerk to have the master plan recorded at the county. The master plan shall be called the "Comprehensive Plan for the City of Wheat Ridge" and shall be hereafter in this article referred to as "the comprehensive plan."

(b)  Amendments to the adopted chapters of the comprehensive plan or new proposed chapters to the comprehensive plan shall be initiated by the planning commission or referred to the planning commission by the city council for the planning commission's recommendation.

(d)  The city council may extend the sixty-day period based upon a finding that such extension would serve the best interests of the city. 
(e)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on all land use cases as prescribed by chapter 26.

Sec. 2-61. - Board of adjustment. 
(a)  The board of adjustment shall have the authority to hear and decide requests for variances and waivers of the city zoning ordinance, floodplain zoning ordinance, and sign code, and for interpretation of those ordinances and codes and the subdivision regulations, subject to those guidelines set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, section 26.D., and as approved by the city council in the form of official rules and regulations for the board of adjustment. 
(b)  The board of adjustment has the responsibility, in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance, section 26.D., to permit in any district a temporary building which is used for a permitted use in that district, or a temporary use of land which is not allowed in that district; such permit is to be issued for no longer than one (1) year per application. 
(c)  In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may, in conformity with all other appropriate provisions of law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator. 
(d)  The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on all applications and appeals, in accordance with public hearing notice and procedure requirements set forth in section 26.D. and F. of the Zoning Ordinance, with the following special conditions required:

If a resolution fails to receive the required number of votes as set forth by section 2-53(d) in favor of the appellant upon appeal or of the application for a variation from the zoning regulations, the action will be deemed equivalent to a denial, and a resolution denying such application or appeal shall be formally entered upon the record. 
(4)  No request to grant a hearing will be entertained unless new evidence is submitted which could not have been, with due diligence, presented at the previous hearing or at least one (1) year has passed since the date of the decision on the previous application or appeal. 
(5)  Any variance granted by the board of adjustment or planning director shall automatically expire within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date it was granted, or within such other time as the board of adjustment or planning director may prescribe, unless a building permit for the variance is obtained within such period of time. If the building permit expires, the variance shall expire at the same time. Extensions of time may be granted for good cause shown, but only if an application for the extension is made prior to the expiration of the variance. 
(e)  The board shall adopt bylaws and rules of procedure that shall be approved by a majority vote of the city council. 
(f)  Appeals of any decision of the board of adjustment may be made by any application or the city to the district court.

(b)  The parties to an administrative appeal shall be the responsible party and the city police department. Parties may be represented by legal counsel. Each party may call and question witnesses, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in support of its case. 
(c)  The AHO, at the request of any party to the hearing, may subpoena witnesses, documents and other evidence where the attendance of the witness or the admission of evidence is deemed necessary to decide the issues at the hearing.

The form of, and the process for issuing, subpoenas shall be the same as in the municipal court. 
(d)  The AHO shall have the power to call and question witnesses, review and consider the relevancy of documentary or other tangible evidence, and rule on evidentiary questions. 
(e)  The only issue to be decided by the AHO is whether the code officer exceeded his/her authority in issuing the administrative citation. To do so, the city bears the burden of proof to establish the existence of a violation of the Code. In the case of a nuisance abatement hearing, the city bears the burden of proof to establish the existence of a public nuisance. The city's meeting of this burden of proof shall constitute prima facie evidence that the code officer did not exceed his/her authority. The appellant shall have the burden of rebutting such evidence.

(l)  In the event that the AHO does not dismiss the administrative citation, the AHO shall assess reasonable administrative costs of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), but not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00). 
(m)  The administrative enforcement order shall become final on the date of mailing the order to the responsible party. A copy of the order shall be provided to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1385, § 1, 5-14-07; Ord. No. 1467, § 5, 7-26-10) 
Sec. 2-89. - Failure to obey subpoena.

(Ord. No. 1385, § 1, 5-14-07) 
Sec. 2-90. - Failure to attend administrative appeal. 
    Any responsible party who fails to appear at the hearing is deemed to waive the right to a hearing and the adjudication of the issues related to the hearing, provided that proper notice of the hearing has been provided. The AHO may take testimony, evidence and argument from the city and issue an administrative enforcement order. 
(Ord. No. 1385, § 1, 5-14-07; Ord. No. 1467, § 6, 7-26-10) 
Sec. 2-91. - Failure to comply with administrative enforcement order. 
    It is unlawful for a responsible party who has been served with a copy of the final administrative enforcement order to fail to comply with the order.

(Ord. No. 1385, § 1, 5-14-07) 
Sec. 2-92. - Penalties assessed. 
(a)  The manager shall develop guidelines for fines based upon the manager's assessment of the cost to the city for enforcing the provisions of this article. Such guidelines shall be approved by the city council. Thereafter, the manager shall publish a schedule of fines for administrative citations. The schedule of fines shall be graduated in amount, with the smallest fine being assessed for the first administrative citation and increasingly larger fines for second, third and subsequent administrative citations. No single fine assessed for an administrative citation shall exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The schedule of fines shall be amended no more than once per year. 
(b)  If the responsible party fails to correct the violation, subsequent administrative citations may be issued for violations of the same applicable section. The fine assessed for each administrative citation issued for violations of the same applicable section(s) shall not exceed the amount set in the manager's schedule of fines regardless of the number of violations per citation. 
(c)  Payment of the fine shall not excuse the failure to correct the violations nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the city. 
(d)  All fines assessed shall be payable to the City of Wheat Ridge. 
(Ord. No. 1385, § 1, 5-14-07) 
Sec. 2-93. - Failure to pay fines. 
(a)  The failure of any responsible party to pay the fines assessed by an administrative citation within the time specified on the citation or administrative enforcement order, if an administrative hearing was held, may result in the imposition of a late fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), a twenty (20) percent charge to defray the cost of collection, and interest at a rate of ten (10) percent per annum on all unpaid amounts. 
(b)  In the event of failure to pay all fines assessed, the manager may refer the matter for collection by whatever means are available to the city. 
(c)  In the case of delinquent charges, assessments or taxes, including fines and the costs of nuisance abatement, the manager shall, pursuant to C.R.S. § 31-20-105, certify the same to the treasurer of the county to be collected and paid over by the treasurer of the county in the same manner as taxes are collected. 
(d)  An action or other process provided by law may be maintained by the city to recover or collect any amounts, including late fees, interests, and administrative costs, owing under this article.

The new provisions set out by Ord. No. 1999-1164 were designated as §§ 3.010-3.300. In order to maintain established Code format and to facilitate the indexing, reference and use, the editor, at his discretion, has redesignated the provisions of this ordinance as §§ 3-1-3-30.

Sec. 3-1. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council finds: 
    There are a substantial number of sexually-oriented businesses in the Denver metropolitan area that require regulation in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizenry. 
    The city council and staff have conducted a review of land use studies concerning the secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses in other cities including: 
(1)  Garden Grove, California. 
(2)  Tucson, Arizona. 
(3)  Austin, Texas. 
(4)  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
(5)  Indianapolis, Indiana. 
(6)  Houston, Texas. 
(7)  Phoenix, Arizona. 
(8)  Amarillo, Texas. 
(9)  Los Angeles, California. 
(10)  New York, New York; two studies. 
(11)  Denver, Colorado. 
    Regulation of sexually-oriented businesses furthers substantial governmental interests and is necessary because, in the absence of such regulation, significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity has included prostitution, narcotics and liquor law violations, violent crimes against persons, and property crimes. 
    Sexually-oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. 
    The concern over sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulation of sexually-oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of citizens. 
    Sexually-oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both neighboring businesses and surrounding residential areas, causing an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. 
    It is recognized that sexually-oriented businesses have serious objectionable characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area. 
    The city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of citizens; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; deter the spread of urban blight and protect citizens from increased crime. 
    It is necessary to have a manager on the premises of sexually-oriented businesses at all times that such establishments are offering sexually-oriented entertainment in order to ensure an individual will be responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees. 
    The license fees required are necessary as nominal fees designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating sexually-oriented businesses; the fees are related to the actual costs of regulation. 
    Restricted hours of operation will further mitigate or prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses. 
    Locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens and thus, certain requirements with respect to the licensing and operation of sexually-oriented businesses are in the public interest. 
    Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Offering sexually-oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions. 
    Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities. 
    Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses where persons view sexually-oriented films. 
    These findings raise substantial governmental concerns. 
    A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to ensure that sexually-oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually-oriented business, and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
    The regulation of nudity in sexually-oriented businesses will further these substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
    Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually-oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
    Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually-oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually-oriented businesses, and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
    A person who recently has been convicted of a specified criminal act as defined herein is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually-oriented business. 
    Barring such individuals from the management or/and employment in sexually-oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
    It is necessary to license the officers, directors and managers of corporate entities because of the control such persons have over the operation and management of the business. 
    It is necessary to limit the age of patrons and employees of sexually-oriented businesses in order to protect them from the potentially harmful consequences associated with such businesses. Sexually-oriented businesses with live entertainers generate more police calls and vandalism than sexually-oriented bookstores, sexually-oriented video stores or sexually-oriented novelty stores and, therefore, it is reasonable to prohibit persons under the age of twenty-one (21) from entering sexually-oriented businesses with live entertainers. Additionally, the minimum age for the consumption of alcoholic beverages is twenty-one (21), and sexually-oriented businesses with live entertainers generally sell alcohol. 
(Ord. No. 1999-1164, § 1(3.010), 8-9-99) 
Sec. 3-2. - Legislative intent. 
    It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to regulate the time, place, and manner in which sexually-oriented entertainment is presented in sexually-oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually-oriented businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses, and not to prohibit sexually-oriented entertainment or to curtail constitutionally protected freedom of expression.

(b)  All applicants shall promptly notify the planning director in writing in the event that any information contained in an application has changed or any information is discovered by the applicant to be incorrect in any way from what is stated on the application, and every applicant shall have the continuing duty to promptly update and supplement such information during the term of any sexually-oriented business license issued to the applicant. The failure to notify the planning director in accordance with this section within thirty (30) days from the date of such change or discovery, by supplementing or updating the application on file with the planning director, shall be grounds for revocation of any application approval or, where a license has been issued, suspension or revocation of an issued sexually-oriented business license. 
(Ord. No. 1999-1164, § 1(3.070), 8-9-99)

The investigation is intended to provide an opportunity to determine whether the application is in conformance with the requirements of this chapter based on information and resources available to the city and to determine if any applicant or those listed in subsection (a) of section 3-6 or manager has been convicted of a specified criminal act. The results of such investigation shall not be interpreted or construed as constituting an affirmation or verification by the city that the information contained in the application is factually correct or accurate. The police chief shall submit a written report of the investigation to the community development director within thirty (30) days after receiving the application from the community development director. Failure of any outside referral agency to respond to a request for information within said thirty (30) days shall be designated in the report as a deemed agency approval of the application. A referral agency response received by the city after the investigative report is due but before an application is approved or denied may be considered by the community development director despite its exclusion from the report. An agency response received after an application has been approved that reveals that the application meets one or more of the denial criteria set forth in section 3-10(a) shall constitute grounds for revocation of approval or, where a license has been issued, revocation of the license in accordance with section 3-16. 
(b)  Within five (5) days of receipt of an application for a sexually-oriented business license, the planning director shall notify the local fire marshal, the local building inspector, and the Jefferson County Health Department of such application. In making such notification, the planning director shall request that the fire marshal and health commissioner promptly inspect the premises for which the sexually-oriented business license is sought to assess compliance with the regulations under their respective jurisdictions.

(e)  The planning director may cause to be conducted any other investigation deemed necessary by the planning director to determine the application's conformance with any requirement of this chapter including, but not limited to, an investigation of the proposed sexually-oriented business location's conformance with the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws, or other applicable laws.

(a)  A completed license application filed with the planning director shall be administratively approved or denied by the planning director within forty-five (45) days of the date of the filing of a complete application. The planning director shall deny a license application if: 
(1)  The applicant is under the age of eighteen (18) years or, if the sexually-oriented business will provide, conduct, feature, show, or present live sexually-oriented entertainment, under the age of twenty-one (21) years; 
(2)  The application or any investigation performed by the city demonstrates or establishes that the proposed sexually-oriented business fails to conform to any requirement of this chapter, the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws, or other applicable law; 
(3)  The applicant knowingly made a false statement or knowingly gave false information in connection with the application;

(5)  The individual applicant or a director or officer of a corporation, or partner of a partnership or manager of a limited liability company or manager of the sexually-oriented business has operated a sexually-oriented business which was determined to be a public nuisance under state, federal or local law within five (5) years prior to the application; 
(6)  A corporate applicant or limited liability company applicant is not in good standing or authorized to do business in the State of Colorado; 
(7)  The individual applicant, manager, director or officer of a corporation, partner of a partnership, or manager of a limited liability company has been convicted of a specified criminal act for which: 
a.  Less than two (2) years have elapsed since the date of the conviction or the date of release from confinement or supervision, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a misdemeanor offense; or 
b.  Less than five (5) years have elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement or supervision, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a felony offense; or 
c.  Less than five (5) years have elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement or supervision whichever is the later date, if the convictions are of two (2) or more misdemeanors. The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the disqualification of the applicant. For the purposes of this subsection, "convicted" includes having pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a specified criminal act or any offense for which the factual basis involved one of the specified criminal acts. "Convicted" includes persons who have received a deferred judgment and sentence or a deferred adjudication for a specified criminal act or any offense for which the factual basis involved one of the specified criminal acts; or 
(8)  The applicant is overdue in payment to the city of taxes, fees, fines, or penalties assessed against the applicant or imposed against the applicant in relation to a sexually-oriented business. 
(b)  In the event that the planning director approves a license application, the planning director shall make a written finding that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter based on the information available and the investigation performed by the city. The planning director may make additional findings as deemed necessary to identify the planning director's basis for approval. The written finding(s) shall be sent by certified mail to the address of the applicant as shown in the application within ten (10) days after the date of the planning director's approval. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent or preclude the planning director from revoking such approval where it is discovered that the application contained or included a false or incorrect statement or false or incorrect information which would otherwise constitute sufficient grounds or basis for the denial of the application. Approval of a license application shall not constitute issuance of a sexually-oriented business license. Issuance of a license shall be made only in accordance with section 3.12. The decision of the planning director to approve a license application shall not be construed as a quasi-judicial act but shall be a final administrative decision of the city. 
(c)  The planning director's approval of a license application shall be valid for one year following the date of approval. Failure to obtain the issuance of the license pursuant to section 3.12 within such one-year period shall require the submission of a new application. 
(d)  In the event that the planning director denies a license application, the planning director shall prepare written findings of fact and a decision stating the reasons or basis for the denial. A copy of the planning director's findings and decision shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the applicant as shown in the application within ten (10) days after the date of the planning director's denial.

(1)  A finding that an individual applicant, partner, officer or director of a corporation, and/or holder of ten (10) percent or more of the stock of a corporate applicant or manager of a pawnbroker's establishment is not of such moral character as to assure that the operations of the pawnbroker's establishment will be conducted lawfully or in a manner which will not be detrimental to the public interest or well-being as determined by the police department's investigation. 
(2)  A finding that an applicant is not financially responsible, is not in good standing or is not authorized to do business in Colorado. As used herein, "financially responsible" means having sufficient income and assets to defray expenses and provide for liabilities of the business as they become due.

(2)  The licensee violates any provision of this article or other ordinance of the city governing the activities permitted by the license; 
(3)  The licensee obtained the license by fraud or misrepresentation; or 
(4)  The licensee has final conviction of any offense involving moral turpitude, including, but not limited to, theft, fraud, robbery, burglary, larceny or deceit, and such conviction, as determined by the police department, would create a danger to the public health, safety or welfare if the licensee were to continue to engage in such conduct. 
(b)  Authority to investigate. For the purpose of investigating violations of this article, any authorized agent of the police department may, at any reasonable time, investigate the business and examine the books, accounts, papers and records of any licensed pawnbroker or any person, partnership or corporation which engages in the business of pawnbroking within the city. Application for or acceptance of a license by a pawnbroker under the terms and provisions of this article shall constitute a continuing consent to entry by any authorized agent of the police department upon the pawnbroker's premises for the purpose of investigating the business and examining the books, accounts, papers and records used therein at any time during the term of the license during regular business hours or whenever the pawnbroker, his employee or agent is upon the premises without compliance with the provision of any other provision in this Code. Willful failure or refusal by the pawnbroker, his agent or employee to permit entry upon the premises by any authorized agent of the police department as provided herein, after presentation of credentials and demand for entry, is a violation of this provision and shall be grounds for revocation of the pawnbroker's license. 
(c)  Authority to revoke license. If the police department is made aware of the grounds in subsection (a) of this section, the police department shall have the authority to revoke the license for the remainder of its term.

Such hearing shall be held within twenty (20) days of a written request for the hearing filed with the police department by the licensee affected. Appeal of the denial of a request for issuance of a pawnbroker's license, or renewal thereof, shall be conducted according to this subsection (d). The hearing shall be conducted as follows: 
(1)  Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the city manager shall designate a hearing officer to decide the matter and will notify the applicant or licensee of the hearing date by mail. 
(2)  The hearing officer is hereby granted the authority to sustain, reverse or modify the police department's decision, and/or upon a showing by the applicant or licensee of mitigating factors, may suspend the license for a period of time and/or impose on the applicant or licensee reasonable conditions on the license or any renewal thereof to secure compliance with this article's standards. 
(3)  Any hearing presented pursuant to this article shall be conducted in conformance with standards of procedural due process applicable to administrative hearings, including the right to present testimony and to confront witnesses. 
(4)  The hearing officer shall apply the following standards for review: (1) whether the city, through the order of revocation, suspension or denial, abused its discretion; (2) acted arbitrarily or (3) acted in excess of its authority hereunder. Additionally, the licensee or applicant shall have the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence why the revocation, suspension or denial of license, or renewal thereof, was improper under the above standards. It shall also be the burden of the licensee to establish the mitigation in contesting any order of revocation or suspension. 
(5)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing within twenty (20) business days of the filing of the request for hearing and shall enter written finding of fact and conclusions of law, which shall be mailed to the licensee or applicant at the address shown on the license application. The hearing officer's decision shall be effective within three (3) business days of the date of the written finding required by this subsection.

(g)  Obtaining similar license during period of suspension prohibited. No person who has had a license suspended or revoked under this article is entitled to obtain the same or any similar license under this article during the period of suspension or revocation, either in the person's own name or as a principal in another business that applies for a license.

Sec. 11-182. - Managers; change of owner, shareholder, partner, officer, director or manager.

(b)  In the event of a change of owner, officer, director or holder of more than ten (10) percent of the shares of stock of a corporate license holder, partner of a partnership or manager, disclosure in writing by amendment of the original application for issuance of a pawnbroker's license thereof shall be made to the police department. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, neither a new license nor an amendment to an existing license shall be required upon any change, directly or beneficially, in the ownership of any licensed pawnshop which is owned directly or beneficially by a person that as an issuer has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act") or is an issuer of securities which is required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to section 15(d) of the Act; provided, that such person files with the commissioner such information, documents and reports as are required by the provisions of the Act to be filed by such issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such issuer shall file with the police department information on managers, officers and directors of such issuer or any licensed or intermediate subsidiary as is otherwise required of managers, officers and directors of corporate pawnbrokers. 
    The applicant or license holder shall pay a fee for amendment of the application, which fee shall be determined by the city and set by resolution. The new manager shall be photographed, fingerprinted and investigated as required in section 11-179. Failure of an applicant to request an amendment of the application or failure to meet the prescribed standards and qualifications of section 11-179 shall constitute grounds for revocation, suspension or nonrenewal of the license.

    A pawnbroker who accepts in pledge any tangible personal property as security for a contract for purchase from one who is not the owner thereof obtains no title in the property either by reason of a pledgor's failure to cancel the contract for purchase or by transference of the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker by the pledgor thereof.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 13-1. - Standard manual. 
(a)  Adopted. The city does hereby adopt, by reference, the most recent edition of the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways," and other related standards issued or endorsed by the federal highway administrator, except as specifically amended hereby. Copies of such manual shall be available from the department of public works, which shall maintain in its offices no less than three (3) current copies, any of which may be purchased by members of the general public for a price to be established by the department of public works. 
(b)  Amendments. The provisions relating to warrants for stop signs and/or traffic-control devices which are listed in the traffic manual adopted in subsection (a) hereof specified in the preceding section are hereby amended by the adoption of the following standards which shall be applicable to all streets and highways within the city, with the city council specifically acknowledging that Standard No. 5 set forth herein is applicable solely to local streets, being defined as streets which are not state highways or county highways: 
(1)  Intersection of a less important road with a main road where application of the normal right-of-way rule is unduly hazardous: 
    This warrant indicated that stop signs should only be placed at intersections that either have high accident rates or where sight distance problems indicate a high potential for accidents. An existing high accident rate would be a location where three (3) or more accidents have occurred during a twelve-month period of the type susceptible to correction by the installation of a stop sign, each accident involving a personal injury or property damage greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) aggregate total. A location with a high potential for accidents will be determined based upon Figure 2-5a and Figure 2-5b of the "Traffic Control Service Handbook" and the procedure therein listed. 
(2)  Street entering a through highway or street: 
    This warrant is applicable where a local street enters a higher volume collector or arterial street. Traffic volume on the through street would be greater than five thousand (5,000) average annual daily traffic. 
(3)  Unsignalized intersection in a signalized area: 
    This warrant refers to streets which have frequent signals (four (4) per mile or more). This is primarily intended to assure smooth traffic flow through coordinated traffic signal systems. 
(4)  Other intersections where a combination of high speed restricted view, and serious accident record indicates the need for control by the stop sign: 
    This warrant covers areas which do not meet the other warrants, yet exhibit serious accident records (personal injury and/or fatalities) which may be correctable by the installation of a stop sign. 
(5)  Other intersections on local streets (being defined as streets which are not state highways or streets maintained by the state or county) where the reasonable possibility or potential for accident exists and indicates the need for control by the stop sign or traffic-control signal devices: 
    For the purposes of this section, the phrase "reasonable possibility or potential for accident" shall be determined by a consideration of pedestrian safety, sight distance, speed and neighborhood safety considerations. This warrant covers areas which do not meet other warrants yet exhibit the reasonable possibility or potential for accident, based upon the factors described above, which may be correctable by the installation of a signal. 
(c)  Review for compliance; requests for placement or removal; appeals. All traffic regulatory signs and control devices shall be reviewed by the director of public works or his designee for compliance with the warrants stated in subsection (b) above. Any requests for placement or removal of regulatory signs (being defined as stop or yield signs) shall be completed by any person requesting review, and review shall be made by the public works director, or his designee, indicating what criteria or warrants as specified above have been met, or not met, which review shall contain a recommended action to be taken.

(b)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to commit an act of domestic violence. 
(c)  Sentencing: 
(1)  A person who is found guilty at trial or who pleads guilty or no contest to a violation of this section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable pursuant to section 16-4 of this Code of Laws. 
(2)  In addition to any sentence which is imposed for a violation of this section, the defendant shall be ordered to complete a treatment program and a treatment evaluation that conforms with the standards adopted by the state domestic violence management treatment board as required by Section 16-11.8-104, C.R.S., as existing or as hereafter amended. If an intake evaluation conducted by a certified treatment program provider discloses that sentencing to a treatment program would be inappropriate, the person shall be referred back to the court for alternative disposition. 
(3)  In addition to any sentence which is imposed for a violation of this section, the court may order treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, counseling for mental health disorders, community service work programs, parenting classes, and/or restraining orders. 
(4)  The probation department will provide monthly reports to the court detailing the information necessary to determine each defendant's compliance with the treatment program referred to in subsection (c)(2) above. The court will provide a copy of that monthly report to the prosecuting attorney's office, and, upon request, other appropriate parties. Such reports are required for the purpose of providing updated information to victims of domestic violence crimes, monitoring the compliance of persons ordered into treatment, assessing the effectiveness of the counseling which is ordered and assessing the effectiveness of the various counseling programs used by the court. 
(5)  In a case in which the underlying facts include an act of domestic violence, the court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest to an ordinance violation which does not include the domestic violence designation, unless the prosecuting attorney makes a good faith representation on the record that such attorney would not be able to establish a prima facie case that the defendant and the alleged victim were currently or formerly involved in an intimate relationship if the defendant were brought to trial on the original domestic violence offense. In a case in which the underlying facts include an act of domestic violence, the court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest to an ordinance violation which does not include the domestic violence designation, unless there is a good faith representation by the prosecuting attorney that such attorney would be unable to establish a prima facie case if the defendant were brought to trial on the original offense. 
(6)  A person charged with a violation of this section is not eligible for deferred prosecution or for home detention in the home of the victim. 
(7)  A person charged with a violation of this section is eligible for a deferred judgment and sentence only if such person has no prior conviction of domestic violence in this or any other jurisdiction.

(8)  Before granting probation or a deferred judgment and sentence, the court shall consider the safety of the victim and the victim's children if probation or a deferred judgment and sentence is granted. 
(d)  Evidence of similar transactions: 
(1)  Domestic violence is frequently cyclical in nature, involves patterns of abuse, and can consist of harm with escalating levels of seriousness. Evidence of similar transactions can be helpful and is necessary in some situations in prosecuting ordinance violations involving domestic violence. 
(2)  In prosecutions involving domestic violence in which the defendant and the victim named in the complaint have engaged in an intimate relationship as of the time alleged in the complaint, evidence of any other acts of domestic violence between the defendant and the victim constitutes other acts or transactions for the purposes of this section and the court may authorize the admission of evidence as provided in subsection (3) of this section. 
(3)  The proponent of evidence of other acts or transactions under this section shall advise the trial court by offer of proof of such evidence and shall specify whether the evidence is offered to show a common plan, scheme, design, identity, modus operandi, motive, or guilty knowledge or for some other purpose. 
(4)  Upon the offer of proof under subsection (3) of this section, the trial court shall determine whether the probative value of the evidence of similar acts or transactions is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury if the evidence is allowed or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. 
(5)  Upon admitting evidence of other acts or transactions into evidence pursuant to this section and again in the general charge to the jury, the trial court shall direct the jury as to the limited purpose for which the evidence is admitted and for which the jury may consider it. 
(e)  Duties of the municipal court. Because of the serious nature of domestic violence, the court in domestic violence actions: 
(1)  Shall not dismiss any charge or delay arraignment or disposition because of concurrent dissolution or other judicial proceedings. 
(2)  Shall waive any requirement that the victim's location, residence and/or phone number(s) be disclosed to any other person unless such person shows the court by clear and convincing evidence that the possibility for further violence is slight and the victim's location, residence and/or phone number(s) is/are necessary for purposes of formulating an affirmative defense. 
(3)  Shall issue a mandatory restraining order against the defendant pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section and such other pretrial orders which accommodate the defendant's ability to acquire necessary information and personal belongings without subjecting the victim to the possibility of further violence. 
(4)  Shall arraign domestic violence cases on the next judicial day whenever possible, but in no case shall arraignment occur more than six (6) days after the date of the arrest. 
(5)  Shall give domestic violence cases priority on the docket. 
(f)  Mandatory restraining order against defendant: 
(1)  There is hereby created a mandatory restraining order against any person charged with any violation of domestic violence pursuant to this section, which order shall remain in effect from the time that the person is advised of such order at such person's arraignment or first court appearance before the court until final disposition of the action or until further order of the court. The provisions of the restraining order may be continued by the court after sentencing if the court deems such action reasonable and necessary. Such order shall restrain the person charged from harassing, molesting, intimidating, retaliating against, or tampering with any witness to or victim of the act(s) charged. A copy of the restraining order issued pursuant to this section shall be provided to the protected party(ies) by the court. 
(2)  Upon motion of the prosecuting attorney, or on the court's motion to protect the alleged victim, the court may enter any of the following further orders against the defendant: 
a.  An order to vacate or stay away from the home of the victim and to stay away from any other location where the victim is likely to be found; 
b.  An order to refrain from contact or direct or indirect communication with the victim; 
c.  An order prohibiting possession or control of firearms or other weapons; 
d.  An order prohibiting possession or consumption of alcohol or controlled substances; and 
e.  Any other order the court deems appropriate to protect the safety of the alleged victim. 
(3)  At the time of the defendant's arraignment or first court appearance before the court, the court shall inform the defendant of the restraining order effective pursuant to this section and shall inform the defendant that a violation of such order is punishable by contempt and may result in further criminal charges. The court shall state the terms of the restraining order issued pursuant to this section, including any additional provisions added pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, to the defendant on the record and the court shall further require the defendant to acknowledge the restraining order as a condition of any bond for the release of the defendant. The court shall notify the alleged victim of the order if such person is not present at the time the restraining order is issued. 
(4)  The defendant, victim, or the prosecuting attorney may request a hearing before the court to modify the terms of a restraining order or to add terms to the restraining order issued pursuant to this section. Upon such a request, the court shall set a hearing and the court shall send notice of the hearing to the defendant and the victim. At the hearing, the court shall review the terms of the restraining order and any further orders entered and shall consider the modification(s) and/or proposed addition(s) requested by the defendant, victim, or prosecuting attorney. No modification(s) or addition(s) shall be made if the victim is not present at the hearing and notified of the modification(s) or addition(s) on the record, unless such modification(s) or addition(s) is/are necessary to comply with a conflicting county or district court order. Notice of an amended restraining order shall be made to the defendant in open court on the record. The victim shall be provided with a copy of the amended restraining order. 
(5)  Restraining orders and amended restraining orders issued against the defendant pursuant to this section shall be considered restraining orders in accordance with the provisions of C.R.S. § 18-1-1001, as existing or as hereafter amended. 
(6)  Any person failing to comply with any provision of a restraining order issued pursuant to this section commits the crime of violation of a restraining order and may be punished as provided in section 16-111 hereafter. 
(g)  Hold pending arraignment. Whenever the court finds a substantial likelihood that a defendant, if released from custody, would commit an additional act of violence against the victim or another family or household member which would cause serious bodily injury or death to either the victim or another family or household member, the court may order that the defendant be held without bond pending arraignment or advisement of rights regarding the alleged offense. If the court orders a hold pending arraignment, however, the defendant shall be arraigned for the alleged offense on the next judicial day. For purposes of deciding the propriety of a hold pending arraignment, the court should consider, among other evidence, the following: 
(1)  The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the victim in the offense charged; 
(2)  The defendant's history of domestic violence against the victim or another family or household member or of violence against any person; 
(3)  Any records of any law enforcement agency regarding past contacts with the defendant, the victim, or another family or household member concerning domestic violence committed by the defendant; and 
(4)  Whether the information presented to the court, taken as a whole, indicates a pattern of escalation, either in frequency or severity, in domestic violence acts by the defendant. 
(h)  Appearance by the victim. Whenever a defendant receives a summons and complaint for a domestic violence violation, a police officer may serve the victim with a subpoena to appear at the same time and date scheduled for the defendant's arraignment. Such subpoena to appear shall be issued by the clerk of the municipal court and the officer who serves the subpoena shall complete the return of service and deliver it to the court. If the victim appears and the matter is not resolved by pretrial conference following the defendant's arraignment, the court may order the victim to appear at the date and time scheduled for the defendant's trial and the victim shall receive a copy of a notice to appear. The court shall exercise its contempt and equity powers to compel the appearance of victims which have been subpoenaed or otherwise ordered to appear. 
(i)  Service of orders. An order, summons and complaint, subpoena or other document issued pursuant to this section shall be personally served upon the appropriate party by the police department, sheriff, or private process server. 
(1)  Whenever necessary, a copy of the summons, subpoena or order shall be given to the appropriate law enforcement agency or private process server for service upon the appropriate party. If a sheriff or private process server requires fees for service or mileage, such fees shall be paid. Upon a conviction, the court shall assess such service fees against the defendant. 
(2)  If the police department, sheriff, or private process server cannot complete service within ten days or forty-eight (48) hours before the date and time of appearance, the police department, sheriff, or private process server shall notify the clerk of the court. 
(3)  Returns of service shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules of the court.

Sec. 21-30. - Permittee guarantee prerequisite to issuance of permit; determination of necessity for repairs; appeal process. 
(a)  The permittee, by acceptance of the permit, expressly guarantees all work done by him for a period of two (2) years from and after the date of final completion and agrees upon demand to maintain and make all necessary repairs to the same during the above period without additional charge or cost to the adjacent property owners or the city. This guarantee shall include all repairs growing out of: 
(1)  Imperfection or unsuitability of material or composition; 
(2)  Defects in workmanship; 
(3)  Settling of fills or excavation; 
(4)  The effects of freezing, thawing and water infiltration; 
(5)  Any unauthorized deviation in the work from that shown on the approved plans and specifications; 
(6)  Work not performed in accordance with the city's standards and specifications; 
(7)  Damage to the work prior to completion of construction; 
(8)  Any other violation of this chapter or the ordinances of the city. 
The guarantee shall extend to the whole body of the work, and the repairs under it may extend to a total reconstruction of the entire project if, in the judgment of the director based upon the plans, specifications and good engineering practices, such total reconstruction is necessary to repair defects. It is not necessary that an additional new two (2) year guarantee be provided for subsequent repairs after initial acceptance. 
(b)  Thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the two-year warranty period, the director shall perform a final inspection of the completed project. The director shall inform the permittee of any necessary repairs and, after completion of repairs by the permittee, shall issue a written notice to the permittee that the completed project is acceptable to the city for maintenance. No work shall be considered accepted by the city until all necessary repairs are complete and the director has issued a final acceptance. If the city does not give permittee written notice of repairs within the two year period, acceptance is deemed. 
(c)  At any time prior to completion of the two-year warranty period, the director may notify the permittee, as set forth in subsection (d) below, of any needed repairs. Emergency repairs shall be completed by the permittee within twenty-four (24) hours if the defects are determined by the city to be an imminent danger to the public health, safety and welfare. Nonemergency repairs shall be completed within thirty (30) days after such notice. 
(d)  The determination of the necessity and responsibility for repairs rests with the director. When the director has determined that repair or reconstruction of any project or part thereof is necessary, based upon any of the acts or omissions enumerated hereinabove within the guarantee period, the action shall be as follows: 
(1)  The director shall, by certified mail, return receipt requested, give notice to the permittee of the necessary requirements to bring such construction into conformance with the approved plans and specifications. 
(2)  Should the permittee dispute the necessity of repairs, he may request a hearing. This request shall be in writing to the director within seven (7) days of the date on the notice for repairs. 
(3)  Should the permittee fail to object in writing within seven (7) days from the date of the notice, or should the permittee fail to begin the necessary repairs or reconstruction within such time, the city may make such repairs or contract for such repairs to be done and charge the cost of same to the permittee, together with a five hundred dollar ($500.00) mobilization charge. The time to make the necessary repairs may be reduced by the director when found to be in the best interest of the public safety. The time may also be extended due to the complexity of the project or weather considerations or in the discretion of the director. The permittee shall have thirty (30) days after formal notification of the cost of the repairs to make full payment to the city. If payment is not received within the thirty-day period, the city may institute an action upon the bond of the permittee or may cause to be instituted a proceeding for the imposition of a lien upon the property of the permittee, the abutting property owners or the utility company or district that owned the facility worked on, as appropriate. 
(4)  If a hearing is requested by the permittee, the director shall issue an order setting a time, place and date, and so notify the permittee. The hearing date shall not be more than forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of the request for a hearing. The permittee shall be afforded a minimum of seven (7) days between service or mailing of the order and the hearing. 
(5)  A hearing requested pursuant to this section shall be an administrative proceeding, conducted in the manner described in section 21-56 of this chapter. Upon completion of the hearing, the director shall take all evidence under advisement and shall, within ten (10) days, transmit the findings and rulings to the permittee. The findings and rulings shall be rendered in writing by certified mail or personal service and, if appropriate, shall contain the date upon which the repair or reconstruction shall commence. 
(6)  All mailings shall be to the last known address of the permittee as shown on the permit. The permittee shall be considered notified if the mailing is returned by the United States Postal Service with the notation that such mailing is either unclaimed or undeliverable and the order was addressed to that address indicated on the permit. 
(e)  In the event of a hearing, the director may appoint a qualified member of the public works department to sit in his place as the hearing official. 
(f)  The warranty described in this section shall cover only those areas of work undertaken by a permittee and/or its contractors. In the event that work of another permittee or the city subsequently impacts a portion of work under warranty by a permittee during the warranty period, then the subsequent permittee or the city shall assume responsibility for repair to the subsequently impacted section of right of way. 
(g)  The decision of the director shall be final.

Failure to do so will result in the use of the permittee performance/warranty guarantee by the city to repair any damage. 
(9)  Each permittee shall protect from injury any adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary measures. The permittee shall, at his own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the work, and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property resulting from failure to properly protect and carry out work in the public way. 
(10)  As the work progresses, all public ways and private property shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess dirt, rock, and other debris. All clean-up operations shall be done by the permittee. 
(11)  Each permittee shall not disturb any surface monuments or survey hubs and points found on the line of work unless approval is obtained from the director. Any monuments, hubs, and points disturbed will be replaced by a Colorado registered land surveyor at the permittee's expense.

Sec. 21-123. - City to permit location. 
    The city may permit one or more providers of courtesy benches in the city. The city may provide for installation of courtesy benches directly by the city, by contract, agreement or otherwise. All courtesy benches shall be constructed and installed in compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and as otherwise provided in this article IV.

ARTICLE V. - NEWSRACKS 

Sec. 21-160. - Intent and purpose. 
    The city council of the City of Wheat Ridge finds and declares that: 
(a)  Findings. 
(1)  The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in public rights-of-way presents an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using such rights-of-way; including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services. 
(2)  Newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rights-of-way, and unsightly newsracks located therein, constitute public nuisances. 
(3)  It is a matter of public necessity that the City of Wheat Ridge protect children and unconsenting adults in and on its public streets, sidewalks, transportation facilities and other public rights-of-way from viewing public displays of offensive sexual material. Such displays are thrust indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children and constitute assaults upon individual privacy. 
(4)  These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious to health, offensive to the senses, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community. 
(5)  The council recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The council further finds that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this chapter which is designed to accommodate such interests regulating the time, place and manner of using such newsracks. 
(b)  Purpose. The provisions and prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted are in pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, morals, and general welfare of persons in the City of Wheat Ridge in their use of public rights-of-way through the regulation of placement, appearance, number, size, and servicing of newsracks on the public rights-of-way so as to: 
(1)  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
(2)  Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including ingress to, or egress from, any place of business or from the street to the sidewalk; 
(3)  Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes, and similar appurtenances, and access to locations used for public transportation purposes; 
(4)  Reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way, protect the aesthetics and value of surrounding properties, and protect the quiet of residential areas; 
(5)  Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation; and 
(6)  Protect the right to distribute information protected by the United States and Colorado Constitutions through use of newsracks. 
(c)  Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this chapter to in any way discriminate against, regulate, or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or dissemination of any printed material that is constitutionally protected.

(1)  Supporting documentation for every line item used on the sales/use tax return. 
(2)  Sales and lease invoices, contracts. 
(3)  Purchase journals and invoices. 
(4)  Fixed asset depreciation schedules. 
(5)  Check books and/or check registers. 
(6)  State sales tax returns. 
(7)  Federal and state income tax returns. 
(8)  Sales journals. 
(9)  Asset ledgers. 
(10)  General ledgers. 
(11)  Journal entries. 
(12)  Chart of accounts. 
(13)  Financial reports. 
(14)  All other supporting documents not listed above. 
(c)  Access to records by city personnel. Business records are to be stored or kept within reasonable access of city personnel. Should a taxpayer's business records be maintained at a location outside the city's jurisdiction, the city maintains the right to inspect such records at the taxpayer's location within the city or to require the taxpayer to make the records available at city offices. 
(d)  Audit of taxpayer business records. The city maintains the authority to audit, upon reasonable notice, the business records of any taxpayer licensed to engage in business activity within the city. If the city provides written notice to the taxpayer prior to the expiration of the thirty-six-month statute of limitations that the taxpayer's records will be audited pursuant to this chapter, such limitation period shall be extended until the conclusion of the audit. 
(e)  Place of audit. The city has adopted the policy of auditing a taxpayer's records only at the taxpayer's business location where such business records are routinely kept at a location in Wheat Ridge or at some other location designated by the treasurer or his or her designee, or at city offices by electronic means. Notwithstanding this policy, the treasurer may, under exceptional circumstances, permit limited scope auditing of a taxpayer's records by mail. Such a determination is solely within the discretion of the treasurer and is not an appealable issue. Any person under audit who requests an audit location other than a location designated by the treasurer or his or her designee shall pay the direct costs and expenses incurred by the city to perform the audit in the requested location. 
(f)  Subpoenas to appear and/or produce records. When the treasurer has scheduled an audit or examination of the records required herein not less than thirty (30) days in advance, and has so notified the taxpayer, and the taxpayer fails to make available the records required in paragraph (b) at the appointed time, the treasurer may apply to any judge of the municipal court of the city and/or district court in and for Jefferson County for a subpoena to require the taxpayer to appear before the treasurer, produce any of the foregoing information in the taxpayer's possession, and testify under oath before the treasurer. If the treasurer is unable to secure from the taxpayer information relating to the correctness of the taxpayer's return or the amount of the taxpayer's taxable sales, the treasurer may apply to any judge of the district court in and for Jefferson County or the municipal court of the city for subpoenas to such other persons as the treasurer believes may have knowledge of the taxpayer's return or income. If the treasurer shows that the taxpayer cannot be found, evades service of subpoena, fails or refuses to produce records or give testimony, the judge may cause subpoenas to be issued to the persons sought, requiring them to appear before the treasurer and give testimony regarding the taxpayer's return or income. If any of the persons so served with subpoenas fail to respond thereto, the judge may proceed against such persons as in cases of contempt. 
(g)  Performance of audit not to limit or preclude additional audits. Performance of an audit does not constitute a statute of limitations or preclude additional audits of the same period within the parameters of section 22-44. 
(h)  Third-party recordkeepers. Any third-party recordkeeper, as defined in section 22-21 hereof, shall have all of the rights, duties and obligations of a taxpayer, retailer or vendor solely as the same relates to the recordkeeping and record disclosing obligations imposed upon taxpayers, retailers or vendors by sections 22-40 and 22-42 hereof; provided, that the city shall attempt to obtain any records or reports from the taxpayer, retailer or vendor prior to its attempts to obtain such records from third-party recordkeepers, and in any event such attempts to obtain records or reports shall only be undertaken after providing notice to the taxpayer, retailer or vendor; provided, further, however that a third-party recordkeeper shall be deemed a taxpayer for all purposes and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this article relating to any and all taxable transactions engaged in by such third-party recordkeeper. 
(i)  Coordinated audit : 
(1)  Any taxpayer licensed in this city pursuant to section 11-1 or 11-23 of this Code of Laws, and holding a similar sales tax license in at least four (4) other Colorado municipalities that administer their own sales tax collection, may request a coordinated audit as provided herein. 
(2)  Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of notice of an intended audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax collection, the taxpayer may provide to the treasurer, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated audit indicating the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was received and the name of the official who issued such notice. Such request shall include a list of those Colorado municipalities utilizing local collection of their sales tax in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax license and a declaration that the taxpayer will sign a waiver of any passage-of-time-based limitation upon this city's right to recover tax owed by the vendor for the audit period. 
(3)  Except as provided in subparagraph (6), any taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit and promptly signs a waiver of the time limits established in sections 22-42(d) and 22-44(a) of this Code of Laws may be audited by the city during the twelve (12) months after such request is submitted only through a coordinated audit involving all municipalities electing to participate in such an audit. 
(4)  If this city desires to participate in the audit of a taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit pursuant to subparagraph (3), the treasurer shall so notify the finance director of the municipality whose notice audit prompted the taxpayer's request within ten (10) days after receipt of the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit. The treasurer shall then cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangement of the time during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be covered by the audit, and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit. 
(5)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this city, the treasurer shall facilitate arrangements between this city and other municipalities participating in the coordinated audit unless and until an official from some other participating municipality agrees to assume this responsibility. The treasurer shall cooperate with other participating municipalities to, whenever practicable, minimize the number of auditors that will be present on the taxpayer's premises to conduct the coordinated audit on behalf of the participating municipalities. Information obtained by or on behalf of those municipalities participating in the coordinated audit may be shared only among such participating municipalities. 
(6)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this city, the treasurer shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between the city and other participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to the taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be audited and the records most likely to be required by participating municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The treasurer shall also propose a schedule for the coordinated audit. 
(7)  The coordinated audit procedure set forth in this section shall not apply: 
a.  When the proposed audit is a jeopardy audit; or 
b.  When a taxpayer fails to provide a timely and complete request for a coordinated audit as provided in such paragraph (2) of this subsection 22-42(i). 
(Ord. No. 1988-781, § 1(21-30), 12-12-88; Ord. No. 1991-869, § 3, 9-1-91; Ord. No. 1991-885, §§ 1, 6, 12-23-91; Ord. No. 1272, § 1, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 1620 , §§ 8-10, 4-10-17) 
Sec. 22-43. - Refusal to report; estimate of tax; emergency collection procedures; penalties and interest. 
(a)  Refusal to report. The treasurer may, in any reasonable manner possible, estimate the amount of the tax due, to which interest and penalties in accordance with paragraph (c) may be added, in the event any taxpayer: 
(1)  Refuses to report and remit taxes collected or required to be collected in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; 
(2)  Fails to comply with the provisions of section 22-68 of this chapter; 
(3)  Fails to file the report and remit the taxes required in section 22-38 of this chapter after selling his business; 
(4)  Intends to leave the city without paying any taxes which are lawfully owed; 
(5)  Removes or intends to remove property subject to tax hereunder from the city, or to sell any such property with the intent to remove the proceeds of sale from the city without paying tax thereon; 
(6)  Engages or intends to engage in any activity which the treasurer reasonably believes to jeopardize collection of taxes authorized hereunder; or 
(7)  Otherwise engages in conduct likely to prevent the establishment by the treasurer of an accurate and exact amount of tax due. 
(b)  Estimation of taxes. When an estimate of taxes due is made, the taxpayer shall be served with notice of the same by first class mail to the taxpayer's last known address or by leaving a copy with the person in charge at the taxpayer's business establishment or last known address. 
(1)  In the event that the taxpayer cannot be found at its last known address or notices sent by the city are returned by the post office, the city may serve notice by posting such notice in a conspicuous place at the location of the business as indicated on the business license or application. The burden shall at all times be on the taxpayer to inform the city of the taxpayer's current address. 
(2)  Unless the taxpayer files a written demand for administrative hearing and determination of tax liability, as provided in section 22-45 hereof, within thirty (30) days from the date of mailing or posting, whichever is later, of such notice, the taxpayer shall conclusively be deemed to have accepted the estimate as a fair and accurate determination of his tax obligation and shall thereby waive the right to contest that determination. In the event that such a hearing is held, the determination of the hearing officer shall be reviewable as provided in section 22-45 hereof. 
(c)  Emergency collection procedures. In any case wherein it appears that collection of revenues from taxes lawfully imposed hereby is in danger of risk of loss or noncollection, or otherwise in jeopardy, the treasurer may immediately issue demand for payment. Upon issuance of such demand for payment, the tax required therein shall be due and payable, and the treasurer may proceed forthwith to collect such taxes by any lawful means, including, not by the way of limitation, filing of liens upon the property subject to tax, issuance and execution of distraint warrants, or filing of summons and complaint in any competent court; provided, however, that collection under this section may be stayed upon the provision by taxpayer to the treasurer of such security as, in the opinion of the treasurer, shall be satisfactory to ensure payment to the city of all taxes lawfully owed by taxpayer. 
(d)  Penalty for late payment. A penalty shall be imposed on any tax deficiency. Such penalty shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) or ten (10) percent of the delinquent tax or deficiency per reporting period, whichever is greater. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Reserved. 
(g)  Penalty for fraud. If any part of delinquent tax or deficiency is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, the penalty shall be one hundred (100) percent of the total amount of the deficiency. The treasurer shall mail a written notice of assessment to the taxpayer. The amount of the tax due, including the penalty and interest, shall become due and payable within ten (10) days after the date of the notice of assessment. 
(h)  Assessment of interest. Interest shall be assessed at the rate of one (1) percent per month. Interest shall be calculated for each month from the due date that a deficiency remains unpaid, up to a maximum of eighteen (18) months, for a maximum total accumulated interest of eighteen (18) percent. 
(i)  Treasurer may waive penalty and interest. For good cause shown, the treasurer in his discretion is authorized to waive all or any portion of any penalty and/or a portion of interest assessed in this chapter, provided, however, at least six (6) percent interest, if owing, must be assessed and may not be waived. 
(Ord. No. 1988-781, § 1(21-31), 12-12-88; Ord. No. 1991-869, § 3, 9-1-91; Ord. No. 1991-885, § 1, 12-23-91; Ord. No. 1996-1060, § 5, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 1272, § 1, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 1597 , § 1, 6-13-16; Ord. No. 1620 , § 11, 4-10-17) 
Sec. 22-44. - Limitation of action. 
(a)  No sales or use tax, or interest thereon or penalties with respect thereto, shall be assessed, nor shall any notice of lien be filed, or distraint warrant issued, or suit for collection be instituted, nor any other action to collect the same be commenced, more than three (3) years after the date on which the tax was or is payable, nor shall any lien continue after such period, except for actual or estimated taxes assessed before the expiration of such period, notice of lien with respect to which has been filed prior to the expiration of such period. 
(b)  In the case of a false or fraudulent return resulting from either an intent to evade tax or from reckless or grossly negligent behavior on the part of the taxpayer, or in the case of failure or refusal to file a return, the tax due, together with all interest and penalties thereon, may be assessed or proceedings for the collection of such taxes may be begun at any time. 
(c)  The period of limitation provided herein shall not run against the city for an audit period if written notice is given to the taxpayer prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations that the latter's records will be audited pursuant to section 22-42(d) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1988-781, § 1(21-32), 12-12-88; Ord. No. 1991-869, § 3, 9-1-91; Ord. No. 1991-885, § 1, 12-23-91; Ord. No. 1272, § 1, 12-9-02) 
Sec. 22-45. - Taxpayer remedies. 
(a)  When the city asserts that sales or use taxes are due in an amount greater than the amount paid by a taxpayer, the city shall mail a deficiency notice to the taxpayer by first class mail. The deficiency notice shall state the additional sales and use taxes due. The deficiency notice shall contain notification, in clear and conspicuous type, that the taxpayer has the right to elect a hearing on the deficiency pursuant to this section. A deficiency notice exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), including penalties and interest, resulting from audit activity shall be delivered by a receipted or traceable method such as, but not limited to, certified mail. 
(b)  In the event that the taxpayer disputes the tax liability imposed by the city either by any deficiency notice or otherwise, he shall file a written demand for an informal hearing and determination of tax liability within thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of the notice, which demand will stay the sale under any distraint warrant until the conclusion of the hearing. To aid in resolution of the dispute, the city requests that the taxpayer's written demand include the following information: Name, business address and license number of the taxpayer, a copy of the notice sent by the city, the taxable periods and the amounts of tax which are being disputed, and a statement of the grounds upon which the taxpayer bases the claim. 
(1)  Upon receipt of the taxpayer's written demand, the treasurer shall set the time and place for the hearing, to be held as quickly as possible. The hearing shall be held before the treasurer or a hearing officer appointed by the treasurer who possesses education or experience in tax administration matters and who can render a proper decision. In the event that it is determined at the hearing that the taxpayer's liability is less than the amount in the possession of the treasurer, such excess shall be paid to the taxpayer forthwith. 
(2)  Failure to demand an informal hearing and determination of tax liability shall constitute an absolute and final waiver of the right to contest such liability either administratively with the treasurer, with the executive director of the state department of revenue pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3), or by judicial review pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(8). When such determination is requested or when a request for a refund is timely made, the final decision rendered therein shall be appealable as provided herein. 
(3)  The hearing provided in subparagraph (b)(1) above shall be informal and no transcript, rules of evidence or filing of briefs shall be required, but the taxpayer and the city may elect to submit written information and present informal witness testimony. The hearing shall be held and a decision issued within ninety (90) days after the receipt of the taxpayer's written request therefor. The treasurer or appointed hearing officer may extend such period if the delay in holding the hearing or issuing the decision thereon was occasioned by the taxpayer, but, in any such event, the hearing shall be held and a decision issued within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the taxpayer's request in writing therefor. 
(c)  If the dispute was not resolved by the informal hearing, the taxpayer, pursuant to the express authority of C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(9), may elect to pursue one of the following avenues of appeal within thirty (30) days of the city's final decision: 
(1)  The taxpayer may request a formal hearing on the record before a hearing officer, who shall be selected from among other metropolitan Denver treasurers/finance directors, or who shall be a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties. The hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days of the taxpayer's request. Those costs of compensation to the hearing officer and transcription costs shall be divided equally between the city and the taxpayer. 
a.  The formal hearing will be on the merits and on the record. The taxpayer shall be responsible for retention of his own legal counsel, if he chooses to be so represented. A transcript of the hearing will be maintained and the Colorado Rules of Evidence shall be observed unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The city shall not be entitled to file a legal brief unless the taxpayer chooses to submit such a brief or statement of legal authorities. The parties may call witnesses who will be subject to cross-examination. 
b.  Upon notice to the taxpayer that the city has granted the taxpayer a formal hearing, the taxpayer shall deposit with the city fifty (50) percent of the amount of the tax deficiency in dispute. The taxpayer will also pay to the city all amounts of tax and related penalties and interest not in dispute. The taxpayer may request permission of the treasurer to post security or a bond in lieu of cash payment of the amount in dispute, which request will be granted by the treasurer if the treasurer, in his sole discretion, determines the bond or security is adequate to protect the city's interest. Failure to post the cash or security required herein shall result in the denial of taxpayer's appeal. 
c.  In the event the final decision denies the taxpayer's claims, such taxes, penalties and interest unpaid shall become immediately payable without further notice of demand for payment by the city. The city may use all additional remedies to collect unpaid taxes, penalties and interest as provided for under section 22-46. 
d.  Any appeal from the decision rendered after such formal hearing shall be pursuant to Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(2)  The taxpayer may request the executive director of the department of revenue to conduct a hearing in accordance with C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(3). 
(3)  The taxpayer may appeal the city's final decision to district court if the criteria of C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1(8) are met. 
(d)  The taxpayer shall have no right to any form of appeal under subsection (c) of this section if he has not exhausted administrative remedies or if he fails to pursue one of the avenues of appeal within the time period described therein. For purposes of this paragraph, "exhaustion of administrative remedies" means: 
(1)  The taxpayer has timely requested in writing an informal hearing before the city in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and the city has held such hearing and issued a final decision thereon; or 
(2)  The taxpayer has timely requested in writing an informal hearing before the city in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and the city has failed to hold such hearing or has failed to issue a final decision within the time period described therein. 
(e)  In the event the city's final decision denies the taxpayer's claims, such taxes, penalties and interest unpaid shall become immediately payable without further notice of demand for payment by the city. The city shall use all additional remedies to collect unpaid taxes, penalties and interest as provided for under section 22-46. 
(Ord. No. 1988-781, § 1(21-33), 12-12-88; Ord. No. 1989-804, § 3, 8-28-89; Ord. No. 1991-869, § 3, 9-1-91; Ord. No. 1991-885, §§ 1, 5, 12-23-91; Ord. No. 1996-1060, § 6, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 1272, § 1, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 1476, § 4, 3-14-11) 
Sec. 22-46. - Additional remedies of city. 
(a)  Any tax imposed by this chapter, together with the interest and penalties herein provided and the cost of collection which may be incurred by the city, shall be and, until paid, remain a first and prior lien and shall take precedence over all other claims and mortgages upon: 
(1)  The goods, stock-in-trade and business fixtures of or used by any retailer under lease, title-retaining contract or other contractual arrangement; and 
(2)  The real and tangible and intangible personal property owned or leased by any person. 
(b)  Any lien arising under this section may be foreclosed by seizing under distraint warrant and selling so much of the property covered by the lien as may be necessary to discharge said lien. Such distraint warrant may be issued by the treasurer whenever the taxpayer or vendor is in default on the payment of sales or use tax, interest and penalty, and may be served and the goods or property subject to such liens seized and sold by the treasurer or any member of the city police department. 
(c)  Goods or property seized pursuant to distraint warrant shall be sold at public auction after thirty (30) days' public notice by publication not less than two (2) times in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. Such goods or other property, whether real or personal, may be redeemed by the taxpayer any time prior to sale by paying such tax, penalty, and interest as is due, together with such costs as have accrued from the seizure and preparation for sale. 
(d)  A notice of lien shall be provided for as set out in section 11-32(d) of this Code of Laws and a copy of such notice shall be filed in the public records of Jefferson County prior to the issuance of a distraint warrant. 
(e)  In lieu of seizure of property pursuant to a distraint warrant, the treasurer may cause a civil action to be filed in the district court of Jefferson County to enforce the city's lien for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property or any right, title, or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall adjudicate all matters involved in such action and may decree a sale of the real property and distribute the proceeds of such sale according to the findings of the court in respect to the interest of the parties and of the city. The proceedings in such action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale, and the execution of a deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and rules of procedure for foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires. 
(f)  The treasurer may treat any taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the city from the taxpayer. 
(1)  In case of failure to pay the taxes, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest thereon, when due, the treasurer may recover at law the amount of such taxes, penalties and interest, and the costs of collection incurred by the city in the Wheat Ridge Municipal Court or in any county or district court of the county wherein the taxpayer resides or has his principal place of business having jurisdiction of the amounts sought to be collected. 
(2)  The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the city, as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due. 
(3)  No such civil action may be filed by the city until the time for the taxpayer to exercise his administrative remedies or to file an appeal has expired. 
(4)  This remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies available to the city. 
(g)  Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this chapter is subject to receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this chapter and for which the taxpayer is in any way liable under the terms of this chapter shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of the taxpayer. No sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this chapter under process or order of any court without first ascertaining from the treasurer the amount of any taxes due under this chapter. If any tax is due, the officer shall pay the amount of the taxes out of the proceeds less costs before making payment to any judgment creditor or other claimants. For the purpose of this chapter, the term "taxpayer" shall include "retailer" or "vendor." 
(h)  It shall be a violation of this chapter to fail or refuse to make any return provided to be made in this chapter, or to make any false or fraudulent return, or any false statement in any return, or to prepare such returns in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, to fail or refuse to make timely payment to the treasurer of any taxes collected or due to the city, or in any manner to evade the collection and timely payment of the tax, or any part thereof, imposed by this chapter, or for any person or purchaser to fail or refuse to pay such tax or evade the timely payment thereof, or to aid or abet another in any attempt to evade the timely payment of tax imposed by this chapter. 
(1)  In his discretion, the treasurer may direct the issuance of a summons and complaint to appear before the Wheat Ridge Municipal Court to any person who may be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated by the treasurer to enforce this chapter. 
(2)  Any person, corporation, partnership, company, association or other entity which violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction of such violation, shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-5 of this Code. Issuance of a summons and complaint by the city and subsequent conviction of a violation of the Code of Laws in the municipal court shall not prohibit the court from requiring payment of all taxes, penalties and interest found to be due under this chapter in addition to any fine imposed by the court. Each and every twenty-four hour period of violation shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter. 
(3)  Nothing contained in this paragraph (h) shall preclude the treasurer from instituting a legal or equitable action in the Jefferson County District Court for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. In the event such an action is undertaken, the city shall be entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs of litigation expended in said action as a portion of its judgment rendered therein. 
(i)  In any action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the city may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication or determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. 
(j)  For the purpose of facilitating settlement and distribution of estates, trusts, receivership, other fiduciary relationships and the assets of corporations in the process of dissolution or that have been dissolved, the treasurer may agree with the fiduciary or surviving corporate directors upon an amount of taxes due from the decedent or from the decedent's estate, the trust, receivership or other fiduciary relationship, or corporation for any periods of tax liability under this chapter. Payment in accordance with such agreement fully satisfies the tax liability for the periods that the agreement covers, unless the taxpayer has committed fraud or malfeasance or misrepresented a material fact regarding the tax or liability therefor. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (3) of this paragraph (j), any personal representative of a decedent or the estate of a decedent, any trustee receiver, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, or any director of a corporation in the process of dissolution or that has been dissolved shall first pay taxes covered by this chapter due from such decedent, decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership, or corporation before he distributed the estate or fund under such person's control. Any such person who fails to pay taxes assessed within the periods authorized by this chapter is personally liable to the extent of the property distributed by such person for any unpaid taxes of the decedent, decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership, or corporation imposed by or due under this chapter. 
(2)  Any distributee of a decedent's estate, a trust estate, or fund and the stockholder of any dissolved corporation who receives any of the property of such decedent's estate, trust estate, fund, or corporation is personally liable for taxes assessed pursuant to this chapter to the same extent that the decedent, trust estate, fund or corporation is liable under this chapter. 
(3)  If a tax under this chapter is due from a decedent or the decedent's estate, personal liability of the persons set forth in this section remains in effect only if a determination of the tax due is made and notice and demand therefor issued within eighteen (18) months after the decedent's personal representative files with the treasurer a written request for such determination, filed after it has filed the decedent's final return or the decedent's estate's return to which the request applies. A request for determination under this subsection does not extend the otherwise applicable period of limitation as specified in section 22-44. 
(4)  If a tax under this chapter is due from a corporation that is in the process of dissolution or has been dissolved, personal liability of directors or stockholders as provided in this section remains in effect only if a determination of the tax due is made and notice and demand therefor issued within eighteen (18) months after the corporation files with the treasurer a written request, for such determination. Such request is required to be filed with the treasurer within ten (10) days from the time such dissolution has began. 
(k)  For property seized pursuant to a distraint warrant, signed inventory of the property distrained shall be made by the treasurer. Prior to the sale, the city shall provide to the owner or possessor of such property, via first class mail, a copy of said inventory, a notice of the sum of the tax due and the related expenses incurred to date, and the time and place of the sale. 
(1)  A notice of the time and place of the sale, together with a description of the property to be sold, shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where distraint is made. 
(2)  The time fixed for the sale shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of distraint. The sale may be postponed by the treasurer for no more than ninety (90) days from the date originally fixed for the sale. 
(3)  The property shall be sold at public auction for not less than a fair minimum price, and if the amount bid for the property is less than the fair minimum price so fixed, the property may be declared to be purchased by the city and the city shall file a release of lien thereof. If the property is purchased by the city, such property may be disposed of in the same manner as other city property and the lien thereon shall be released. 
(4)  The property may be offered first by bulk bid, then subsequently for bid singularly or by lots, and the city or its agent may accept the higher bid.

Sec. 22-47. - Intercity claims for recovery. 
    The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect, and remit sales and use taxes to the city. 
(1)  As used herein, "claim for recovery" means a claim for reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
(2)  When it is determined by the treasurer that sales and use tax owed to the city has been reported and paid to another municipality, the city shall promptly notify the vendor that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
(3)  The city may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the city, or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for a recovery lies in the sole discretion of the city. Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approves or denies, in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The municipality to which the city submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim and approval of such extension by the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(4)  Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the city shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the city shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(5)  The city may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(6)  The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the thirty-six (36) month period to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery.

Sec. 22-48. - Notice of sales and use tax ordinance amendment. 
(a)  In order to keep current the central register of sales and use tax ordinances for municipalities that administer local sales tax collection, the treasurer of the city shall file with the Colorado Municipal League, prior to the effective date of any amendment, a copy of each sales and use tax ordinance amendment enacted by the city. 
(b)  Failure of the city to file such ordinance or ordinance amendment pursuant to this section shall not invalidate any provision of the sales and use tax ordinance or any amendment thereto.

Sec. 22-50. - Confidentiality of information and records. 
(a)  Except in accordance with judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, the treasurer, outside agents of the city, clerks and employees thereof, shall not divulge or make known in any way any confidential commercial, financial, geological or geophysical data disclosed in any document, report or return filed under this chapter. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or a duly authorized representative thereof of a copy of any return or report filed in connection with such person's tax. Copies of such records may be certified by the city manager or an agent thereof and when so certified shall be evidence equally with the originals and may be received as evidence of their contents. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the items thereof or the inspection of returns by the city attorney or other legal representatives of the city. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the treasurer may furnish to the taxing officials of the State of Colorado, its political subdivisions, any other state, or political subdivision, or the United States, any information contained in tax returns and related documents filed pursuant to this title or in the report of an audit or investigation made with respect to a return, if the recipient jurisdiction agrees with the treasurer to grant similar privileges to the city and if such information is to be used by the jurisdiction only for tax purposes.

(1)  Retail sales. The sale, purchase, lease, rental or grant of license for use of tangible personal property, and any subsequent lease, rental or sale of tangible personal property by any person to any consumer or purchaser, regardless of whether the person purchasing, leasing, renting or selling the personal property paid the tax imposed on his initial purchase and use of the property so acquired which is subsequently leased, rented or sold. When a retail sale involves the exchange or trade-in of property, the tax shall be collected on the purchase price paid or charged, including the fair market value of the property exchanged or traded-in at the time and place of exchange or trade-in, except as specified under the definition of "price" or "purchase price" under section 22-21 hereof. 
(2)  Leases or rentals. If tangible personal property is purchased for use exclusively in the rental or leasing business and is not at any time used for the purchaser's general business or personal use, use tax is not due upon the purchase of the tangible personal property, but a sales tax is due upon the rental or leasing of tangible personal property used in the rental or leasing business, regardless of whether a sales or use tax has been paid upon a previous purchase of the property.

For purposes of this section, "telecommunications service" includes the installation of any telecommunications equipment or apparatus. A credit shall be allowed to the extent provided in section 22-66(e) for any telecommunications services subject to the tax herein that are also subject to a sales tax outside of this city if such tax is correctly assessed.

This cost shall include all direct materials and labor costs associated with the production of the meals, and all indirect overhead costs associated and attributable to the production of the meals. Indirect overhead shall utilize "full absorption" as defined and utilized in U.S. Treasury tax statutes and Internal Revenue Service regulations.

Owners of vending machines that vend articles of tangible personal property are subject to sales or use tax on the cost of the vending machines, provided that owners of vending machines that do not vend articles of tangible personal property are not subject to the sales or use tax on the cost of such machines; instead, the utilization of such machines are considered short-term rentals of tangible personal property and the gross receipts are subject to the sales tax.

All retail sales of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more by a florist or restaurant that delivers meals are taxable, and all orders taken by florists or delivery restaurants within the city and telephoned, faxed, electronically mailed, or otherwise communicated to florists or delivery restaurants outside the city are subject to the city sales tax. When a florist or delivery restaurant within the city receives an order from a florist or delivery restaurant outside the city, the sale is exempt from city sales tax.

In the event either the city's sales or use tax is paid on any nonexempt medical supply or item of medical equipment at the time of its purchase by the nonexempt health care facility, physician, dentist or veterinarian, there shall not be a sales tax imposed on any further sale or consumption of such medical supply or item of medical equipment, the intent being to subject all transactions involving nonexempt medical supplies and equipment to either the sales tax or the use tax, but not both.

An anticipated cash discount to be allowed for payment on or before a given date is not an allowable adjustment to the selling price in determining gross taxable sales on any vendor's return prior to the date when the customer actually receives the discount. Any adjustments in sale price such as allowable discounts, rebates, and credits cannot be anticipated and the tax must be based upon the original selling price unless such adjustments have actually been made prior to the filing of the return wherein such sale is reported; except that, if the price upon which the tax was computed and paid to the city by the vendor is subsequently readjusted, prior to the payment of the tax by the purchaser, a proper credit may be taken against the tax due on the next subsequent return.

(a)  Any retailer that collects and remits sales tax to the city as provided in this division may use an electronic database of state addresses that is certified by the state department of revenue pursuant to C.R.S., § 39-26-105.3, to determine the jurisdictions to which tax is owed.

It is hereby declared that every resident of the city or any person doing business within the city who purchases, leases or receives a grant of a license to use tangible personal property for use, storage or consumption within the city from sources outside the city and taxable hereunder, and who has not paid the city sales tax imposed by this chapter, shall make an application, file a return, and pay the tax to the city. The use, storage or consumption of tangible personal property includes, for the purpose of this chapter, materials, commodities and items of tangible personal property affixed to, or made a part of, facilities and structures on real property owned or leased within the city. 
(b)  Acquisition of business. The city use tax shall be remitted on the price paid for tangible personal property which is acquired with the purchase of a business, and for use in the operation of a business. The tax shall be based on the price paid for such chattels as recorded in the bill of sale or agreement and constituting a part of the total transaction at the time of the sale or transfer, provided the valuation is as great or greater than the fair market value of such merchandise or chattels. Where the transfer of ownership is a package deal made by a lump-sum transaction, the use tax shall be paid on the book value established by the purchaser for income tax depreciation purposes or fair market value if no determination has been made. When a business is taken over in return for the assumption of outstanding indebtedness owed by former owners, the tax shall be paid on the fair market value of all taxable tangible personal property acquired by the purchaser. Such tax shall be reported on the initial use tax return and remitted on or before the twentieth day of the month following the date of sale. Timely remittance shall be evidenced by the postmark date. 
(c)  Taxation of leases. 
(1)  The sales tax on any lease payment shall be paid by the lessee and shall be remitted by the lessor to the city, providing the property is located in the city at the time the payment is due. The amount of sales tax due on such lease payment shall be that amount imposed by section 22-56 of this Code on the lease payment due date. In no event shall a multi-year lease be exempt from any change in sales tax rates during the term of said lease. 
(2)  Payment and remittance of sales tax to the city pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be made on each payment made under the lease, including, but not limited to, each payment under any option to purchase contained in the lease, each payment for termination of the lease, and each payment for purchase of the leased property if the same is sold to the lessee after termination of the lease, regardless of the subsequent location of the property. 
(3)  The city will collect use tax only from the lessee and only on any lease payment which is due when the property is located within the jurisdiction of the city. Such collection of use tax on a lease payment shall be subject to the credit provisions of subsection (e). 
(4)  Any applicable use tax shall be imposed on the lessee and not on the lessor. 
(5)  Any applicable use tax shall be based upon the full purchase price of the property. 
(6)  If a lease is renewed, it shall be treated in the same manner as provided in this section. 
(d)  Use tax applied to construction equipment. Proration of the use tax shall be applied to construction equipment as follows: 
(1)  Construction equipment located within the boundaries of the city for more than thirty (30) consecutive days shall be subject to the full applicable use tax of the city. 
(2)  Construction equipment which is located within the boundaries of the city for thirty (30) consecutive days or fewer shall be subject to the city's use tax as follows: the purchase price of the equipment shall be multiplied by eight and three-tenths (8.3) percent, the result of which shall be multiplied by three and one-half (3.5) percent, the result of which shall be the amount of use tax due. 
(3)  Where the provisions of subsection (d)(2) of this paragraph are utilized, the credit provisions of this section shall apply at such time as the aggregate sales and use taxes legally imposed by and paid to other statutory or home rule municipalities on any such equipment equal to three and one-half (3.5) percent. In order to avail itself of these procedures, the taxpayer shall: 
a.  Prior to or on the date the equipment is located within the boundaries of the city, the taxpayer shall file with the city an equipment declaration on a form provided by the city. Such declaration shall state the dates on which the taxpayer anticipates the equipment will be located within and removed from the boundaries of the city, shall include a description of each such anticipated piece of equipment, and shall include such other information as reasonably deemed necessary by the city. 
b.  The taxpayer shall file with the city an amended equipment declaration reflecting any changes in the information contained in any previous equipment declaration no less than once every ninety (90) days after the equipment is brought into the boundaries of the city or, for equipment which is brought into the boundaries of the city for a project of less than ninety-days duration, no later than ten (10) days after substantial completion of the project. 
c.  The credit provisions of subsection (e) shall not apply. 
(e)  Credit for sales or use tax previously paid to another municipality. 
(1)  The city's sales and use tax shall not apply to the storage, use or consumption of any article of tangible personal property the sale or use of which has already been subjected to a sales or use tax of another statutory or home rule municipality legally imposed on the purchaser or user equal to or in excess of three and one-half (3.5) percent. A credit shall be granted against the city's use tax with respect to the person's storage, use or consumption in the city of tangible personal property, the amount of the credit to equal the tax paid by him by reason of the imposition of a sales or use tax of the previous statutory or home rule municipality on his purchase or use of the property. The amount of the credit shall not exceed three and one-half (3.5) percent. 
(2)  Credit shall not be given for use tax or warehouse tax paid to another jurisdiction if such tax was improperly assessed or imposed by the other jurisdiction. 
(3)  Credit shall not be given for funds paid to another taxing jurisdiction for any type of permit or licensing fee.

(2)  By obtaining a city sales and use tax license and making monthly reports and returns and remitting the tax on an actual cost basis.

Sec. 22-74. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the enhanced sales tax incentive program created by this division is to encourage the establishment and/or substantial expansion of retail sales tax generating businesses within the city, thereby stimulating the economy of and within the city, thereby providing employment for residents of the city and others, thereby further expanding the goods available for purchase and consumption by residents of the city, and further increasing the sales taxes collected by the city, which increased sales tax collections will enable the city to provide expanded and improved municipal services to and for the benefit of the residents of the city, while at the same time providing public or public-related improvements at no cost, or at deferred cost, to the city and its taxpayers and residents.

Sec. 22-75. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Enhanced sales tax shall mean the amount of sales tax collected by the city over and above a base amount negotiated by, and agreed upon by, the applicant and the city, and which amount is approved by the city council, which base amount shall never be lower than the amount of sales taxes collected by the city at the property in question in the previous twelve (12) months plus a reasonable and agreed upon percentage of anticipated increase in sales taxes, or, in the case of a newly established business, an amount which represents the good faith determination by the applicant and the city as to the amount of sales taxes which could be generated from the new business without the participation by applicant in the ESTIP created under this division. 
    ESTIP means the enhanced sales tax incentive program created under this division. 
    Owner or proprietor shall mean the record owner or operator of an individual business, or, in the case of a shopping center, the owner of the real property upon which more than one (1) business is operated, provided that the owner (whether an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity) is the owner or less or of the individual businesses operated thereon.

Sec. 22-76. - Participation.

(Ord. No. 1988-758, § 1(24-4), 5-23-88; Ord. No. 1990-854, § 1, 11-26-90; Ord. No. 1272, § 1, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 1553 , § 1, 8-11-14) 
Sec. 22-77. - Approval of agreement; use of funds generally. 
    Approval by the city council of an agreement implementing this ESTIP shall entitle the successful applicant to share in enhanced sales taxes derived from applicant's property or business in an amount which shall not in any event exceed the enhanced sales taxes; provided, however, the applicant may use such amounts only for public and/or public-related purposes such as those specified herein and which are expressly approved by the city council at the time of consideration of the application. The time period in which the enhanced sales taxes may be shared shall not commence until all public or public-related improvements are completed, and shall be limited by the city council, in its discretion, to a specified time, or until a specified amount is reached.

Sec. 22-79. - Increments, sharing of funds. 
    The base figure for sales taxes shall be divided into twelve (12) monthly increments, which increments are subject to agreement between the parties, and approval by the city council, and which increments shall be reasonably related to the average monthly performance of the business or property in question, or similar businesses in the area (i.e. adjust for seasonal variations). If in any month the agreed upon figure is not meet by the applicant so as to create enhanced sales tax for that month, no funds shall be shared with the applicant for that month, and no increment shall be shared until that deficit, and any other cumulative deficit, has been met, so that at the end of any twelve-month cycle, no funds have been shared in excess of the agreed enhanced sales taxes.

Sec. 22-80. - Revenues restricted. 
    It is an overriding consideration and determination of the city council that existing sources of city sales tax revenues shall not be used, impaired, or otherwise affected by this ESTIP. Therefore, it is hereby conclusively determined that only enhanced sales taxes generated by the properties described in an application shall be subject to division under this ESTIP. It shall be the affirmative duty of the sales tax division to collect and hold all such enhanced sales taxes in a separate account apart from the sales taxes generated by and collected from the other sales tax generating uses and businesses within the city and to provide an accounting system which accomplishes the overriding purpose of this section. The city council finds and declares that this division would not be adopted or implemented but for the provisions of this section.

ARTICLE I. - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 

Sec. 26-101. - Name. 
    Chapter 26 of the Code of Laws of the City of Wheat Ridge shall hereinafter be known as the "Zoning Code of the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado," or the "zoning code," "this code" or "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-102. - Intent and purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of the zoning code of the City of Wheat Ridge is to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the city to ensure a logical growth of the various physical elements of the city; to lessen congestion in the streets and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation within and through the city; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air to the residents, structures and properties within the city; to improve housing standards; to conserve property values; to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewage, schools, parks and other public improvements; to protect against poor or inadequate drainage or flood conditions and poor geologic conditions; and in general to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and residents of the City of Wheat Ridge. It is further the intent of this zoning code to preserve the right of citizens to participate in the making of decisions which affect their properties while preserving, to the maximum lawful extent, the legislative and quasi-judicial discretion of the elected representatives of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-103. - Site development review process. 
A.  All site development within the city shall be required to follow the procedures and satisfy the requirements set out below prior to development. "Site development," as used in this chapter, is a general and inclusive term, and is defined in section 26-123. The developer is required to attend in person or by authorized representative, all meetings at which the project is considered, unless otherwise notified by the community development department. The use of property may not be substantially changed, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved or substantially altered except in accordance with and pursuant to one (1) or more of the approvals listed in the review process chart. Clearing, grading, filling or excavation may be commenced subject to the approvals required in this chapter and pursuant to section 26-623. 
B.  All site development must also obtain building and construction permits pursuant to the uniform codes adopted by the city, and must comply with all other applicable sections contained within this chapter and chapter 5. All applications for building permits, exclusive of single and two-family dwellings, shall comply with the applicable standards set forth in the Architectural and Site Design Manual and the Streetscape Design Manual. 
C.  In addition to the requirements of this chapter, the provisions of section 5.1.1 of the Wheat Ridge Home Rule Charter, pertaining to building height and density limitations, apply. 
D.  All applications for approval of site development pursuant to this chapter shall be accompanied by proof of ownership by the applicant of the subject property. Such proof may take the form of a recorded deed, a title commitment, or a power of attorney from the owner(s) where an agent acts on their behalf. In the case of application for special use permits, both the owner of the property and proposed special use must join in the application. 
E.  All site development that includes new water use in an amount more than that used by fifty (50) single-family equivalents shall provide, concurrently with the first application for any of the approvals listed in the review process chart, section 26-106, evidence that the water supply proposed to serve the development will be sufficient in terms of quality, quantity, dependability and availability to provide a supply of water for the type of development proposed, which may include reasonable conservation measures and water demand management measures to account for hydrologic variability. The city's determination as to whether the proposed water supply is adequate to serve the proposed development shall be based upon: (i) evidence that the development will be served by a public water supply entity currently providing treated water service within the city, which district has been operating within the city for no less than ten (10) years prior to the date of application for approval of the site development; (ii) if requested by the city, a letter from the state engineer commenting on such documentation; (iii) whether the applicant has paid to a water supply entity (as defined in C.R.S. § 29-20-302) a fee or charge for the purpose of acquiring water for or expanding or constructing the infrastructure to serve the proposed development; and (iv) any other information deemed relevant by the city, including, without limitation, any information required to be submitted by the applicant pursuant to this chapter or state statutes. The city shall not approve such development application unless it finds, in its sole discretion and after considering the application and all of the information provided, that the applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed water supply will be adequate. The city shall make its determination concerning adequate water supply only once during the development permit approval process unless the water demands or supply of the specific project for which the development permit is sought are materially changed.

Sec. 26-104. - Preapplication conference. 
    Prior to the formal submittal of any request for approval to proceed with site development, an informal preapplication conference shall be held between the applicant and the community development department staff. This conference will serve to acquaint the applicant with the requirements of this chapter and to allow staff to become familiar with the applicant's development intent and design philosophy. A schematic site plan and building concept drawings will aid in discussion at this conference; however applicants are encouraged not to prepare detailed designs which might require extensive revision as a result of the preapplication conference. An applicant should bring the following information in a brief summary: 
  General project concept and information, including the location of the project and a written description of the proposal. 
  Specific uses proposed, and intensity of use proposed (floor area and parking demand). 
  Proposed construction timing. 
  General concepts concerning building size and exterior materials and site plan concepts. 
  An exterior materials package including roof material and color, wall treatment, glass and glazing. 
  A site plan drawing depicting the location of existing and proposed buildings, the location of property lines, setback lines and build-to lines, circulation concepts, landscaping, the location of loading areas, and the location and size of all parking areas, lighting, and signs.

Sec. 26-105. - Review process. 
A.  All site developments must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the review process and standards set forth in this article. The following chart establishes the required review steps applicable to different forms of site development. Applicants seeking site development approval should refer to the chart to determine which one (1) or more "approval requested" under the left-hand column of the chart applies to the proposed site development. The required stages of review for such approval are shown on the lines to the right. Submission requirements and the specific review process for each stage are set out in detail in the balance of this chapter under the appropriate headings. Unless otherwise indicated, amendment or modification of prior site development approval shall follow the procedure for review of the original application. Notwithstanding § 31-23-215, C.R.S., the planning commission is not required to act on any application (including subdivisions) until sixty (60) days following the first public meeting or public hearing. 
B.  In the event the planning commission or city department with jurisdiction recommends denial of the application at any stage, the applicant may choose to proceed to the next stage of review or may resubmit the application at the first stage. In the event the review stage is before the city council, the application may not be further processed following a denial. If, in the opinion of the community development department, a submittal at any stage of review is incomplete, the matter shall be removed from the agenda and not further processed until deemed complete. 
C.  The planning commission, city council, board of adjustment or community development staff may require at any stage of review of any site development, submission of any plan, study, survey or other information, in addition to that specified in this chapter, and at the applicant's expense, as such body may determine necessary to enable it to review and act upon the application in order to determine whether the application complies with the requirements of this chapter.

Sec. 26-107. - Expiration of development approval; reapplications. 
A.  Any approval of site development shall expire and become null and void if: 
(1)  For variances, a building permit is not issued within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date it was granted. See section 26-115.4. 
(2)  If an approved special use ceases operation for any reason for a period of one (1) year, the special use permit shall be deemed expired, unless otherwise provided in the permit itself. 
For administrative special use site development approvals, the community development director shall decide whether the zoning and/or permitted use of the property shall revert to that in place prior to the expired approval. For special uses approved through a public hearing process, a public hearing before the city council shall be held to confirm whether the permitted use of the property shall revert to that in place prior to the expired approval. 
(3)  Except as otherwise provided herein, every building permit issued shall expire one hundred and eighty (180) days after issuance. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, one (1) or more extensions of time, for periods of not more than one hundred and eighty (180) days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. The extension shall be granted if it is demonstrated that the extension will assist or expedite the completion in a timely manner. Any denial of an extension may be appealed to the director of community development. 
B.  After site development approval has expired, no work shall be commenced until the developer has received new approval pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
C.  A new application for substantially the same development process may not be refiled for one (1) year after denial. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1321, § 1, 4-12-04; Ord. No. 1360, § 3, 6-12-06; Ord. No. 1430, § 4, 2-23-09) 
Sec. 26-108. - Site development review fees. 
A.  Procedure for payment. At the time the application for site development is first submitted to the city, and prior to any review, the applicant shall pay to the city the fee necessary to cover the administrative and review costs for each project requiring review. The amount of the fee shall be established by the community development department and kept on file in the office of the city clerk. 
B.  Supplemental fees. Applications for site developments of large scale, complexity, or which are likely to produce substantial onsite or offsite physical, social or economic impacts may require special review by engineering, technical, scientific and other expert personnel not normally employed on a regular basis by the city. In the judgment of the community development director such independent expert review and analysis shall be added to the application fees contained herein and charged to the applicant. Payment of such supplemental fees by the applicant to the city shall be a precondition for the granting of all permits or approvals requested by the applicant and requiring independent expert review or analysis. In addition, applications for proposed land use changes requiring legally mandated State of Colorado agency reviews by agencies charging fees for such review services shall be assessed supplemental fees in the amount of such charges incurred by the city. Such supplemental fees shall be paid by the applicant to the billing agency as a precondition for the granting of all required permits and approvals. 
C.  Lien on property. If the city incurs costs beyond the amount deposited with the city and the applicant does not pay those costs within thirty (30) days after written notice from the city, the city shall be entitled to a lien for those costs on the land being developed, which lien may be perfected and foreclosed in the same manner as provided in § 31-20-105 or § 38-22-101, et seq., C.R.S. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1547 , § 5, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-109. - Public hearing notice and procedure. 
A.  Pre-application neighborhood meeting. Prior to submitting any application, for approval which requires a neighborhood meeting under the provisions of section 26-106, Review process chart, an applicant shall be required to do the following: 
1.  Applicant shall, by regular mail or by pamphlet or flyer personally delivered, notify all residents within six hundred (600) feet of the area subject to the land use application of a meeting to be held, at a time and place selected by applicant but reasonably calculated to be convenient both to applicant and those residents notified, for the purpose of allowing the applicant to present to said residents the nature, character and extent of the action requested by applicant, and further to allow the residents to give input to the applicant regarding said proposal. 
2.  The intent of this proposal is to give adequate opportunity for both applicants and residents to give and receive input regarding proposed projects prior to their formal submission so that the projects are carefully designed and conceived to be compatible with surrounding neighborhoods. It is not the intent of the city council to require formal agreements between applicants and residents prior to submission of applications, nor is any applicant to be denied the right to proceed to any required or permitted hearings regarding such application because no agreement is reached. Rather, the city council by this subsection is encouraging reasonable, honest, good faith communication between residents and applicants, and vice versa. 
3.  No application shall be accepted by the city's staff until applicant has certified by affidavit that he has complied with the provisions of this subsection A. 
B.  Published notice. At least ten (10) days prior to any public hearing for a specific site or development which requires approval by the planning commission, board of adjustment or city council, the director of community development shall cause to be published, on the city's website and in the legal section of a newspaper of general circulation within the city, a notice of public hearing. The notice shall specify the kind of action requested; the hearing authority; the time, date and location of hearing; and the location of the parcel under consideration by street address. A legal description of the parcel under consideration shall also be specified in the notice published on the city's website. Notwithstanding the above, any action which requires approval by passage of an ordinance by city council shall be subject to the regular ordinance approval process, which includes a first reading of the ordinance by city council at a regular meeting where no testimony is allowed. Then, if passed upon first reading, council establishes the time and date of the public hearing and the city clerk shall cause the proposed ordinance to be published in a form and manner as described above. 
C.  Posted notice. At least fifteen (15) days prior to any public hearing for a specific site development which requires approval by the planning commission, board of adjustment or city council, the director of community development shall cause to be prepared, and the applicant shall post, a sign (one (1) per street frontage) upon the parcel under consideration for approval which provides notice of the kind of action requested; the hearing authority; the time, date and location of hearing; and the location of the parcel under consideration by address or approximate address. The sign shall be posted within the property boundaries, shall be affixed to a flat surface, shall measure twenty-two (22) inches in height by twenty-eight (28) inches in width, shall be elevated a minimum of thirty (30) inches from the ground (however, not more than six (6) feet above ground), shall be visible from the street without any obstructions, shall be legible and displayed for fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. The sign shall be maintained in good condition by the applicant throughout the fifteen-day posting period. The sign shall be removed within seventy-two (72) hours from the date the public hearing is concluded. The fact that a parcel was not continuously posted the full fifteen (15) days may not, at the discretion of the hearing authority, constitute grounds for continuance where the applicant can show that a good faith effort to meet this posting requirement was made. 
D.  Letter notice. At least fifteen (15) days prior to any public hearing which requires notification by letter, the director of community development shall cause to be sent, by first class mail, a letter to adjacent property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the property under consideration and to owners of property included within the area under consideration. The letters shall specify the kind of action requested; the hearing authority; the time, date and location of hearing; and the location of the parcel under consideration by address or approximate address. Failure of a property owner to receive a mailed notice will not necessitate the delay of a hearing by the hearing authority and shall not be regarded as constituting inadequate notice. 
E.  Public hearing rules: 
1.  Postponements: After a public hearing has been legally noticed, only one (1) postponement by the applicant may be allowed by the planning commission, board of adjustment or city council. Upon the second request for postponement, the planning commission, board of adjustment or city council shall have the authority, which they may exercise at their discretion, to dismiss the application. 
2.  Rehearing requests: No application shall be submitted to or accepted by the planning commission, board of adjustment or city council (whichever is the final hearing authority) if any previous application for the same or substantially similar request for the same property or portion of property has been denied during the preceding twelve (12) months. The twelve-month time limitation contained herein shall commence on the date of any final determination of denial by the planning commission, board of adjustment, city council or a court of record, whichever is later. 
    The twelve-month time limitation specified in this section shall be strictly adhered to except upon a finding by the final hearing authority, after evidence presented by the applicant, that a major change in physical conditions and circumstances warrants an earlier hearing. "Major change in physical conditions and circumstances" shall, for the purposes of this section, mean a significant modification in the character and nature of the proposed development or use, and shall be reflected in the intensity of the use, the external effects on adjacent properties or such other factors as may be determined by the planning commission, board of adjustment and/or the city council. 
    An exception to the twelve-month rehearing period may be allowed where the applicant or a member of the final hearing authority who voted with the prevailing side requests a rehearing on the same application no later than at the next regular or special meeting. The granting of a rehearing shall be by majority vote and shall be based upon the submittal of new evidence which could not have been, with due diligence, presented at the previous hearing on the application. 
3.  Quasi-judicial matters: Any application which involves the use and/or development of a specific parcel of land, as opposed to a city-initiated large area or city-wide proposal, is considered a quasi-judicial matter. Therefore, applicants, opponents and proponents are prohibited from making ex parte contact (that is, contact outside of the public hearing forum) with any member of the decisionmaking authority. 
F.  Public notice time requirements. Unless otherwise provided in the Code of Laws, public notice time requirements include the day the notice is posted, appears in the newspaper, or is received by a recipient, and shall also include the day of the public hearing. By way of example, a public hearing advertised in a Thursday newspaper, which requires a fifteen-day notice, is eligible for hearing no sooner than the second subsequent Thursday.

B.  Wadsworth Boulevard Corridor Plan adopted. 
1.  The Wadsworth Boulevard Corridor Plan (hereinafter, for purposes of this section, the "plan"), dated May 12, 1999, and prepared by RNL Design, is hereby adopted as a regulation. All "site development," as that term is defined at section 26-123 of this Code, shall, if proposed to be located within the area covered by the plan, comply with the requirements of the plan and of this section and their included and referenced appendices and regulations. Such compliance shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other requirements of this Code of Laws, including without limitation sections 5-45 (public improvements) and 26-224 (design manuals). In the event of conflict among or between the plan and such section on their included and referenced appendices and regulations, the more stringent requirement shall control. 
2.  Regulations authorized. The community development and public works directors are hereby authorized to promulgate regulations for the further implementation of the elements of the plan, as appropriate. All such regulations shall be guided by and consistent with the purposes, goals and requirements of the plan. Such regulations, when so promulgated, shall be fully enforceable as permitted by this section. 
3.  Copies on file. The director of community development shall maintain copies of the plan on file in his or her office for public inspection, copying and/or purchase. 
C.  Reimbursement for public improvements. Where a property exists adjacent to an unimproved or unconstructed street right-of-way or drainageway, the applicant for site development of such property shall be responsible for construction of public improvements to that street, right-of-way, or drainageway, including an engineered roadway design, paving, curb, gutter, sidewalk, and storm water detention and conveyance facilities. The city may require, as a condition of and at the time of site development approval of adjacent properties benefited by such public improvements, that the applicant or applicants for site development initially paying for such public improvements be reimbursed by the applicant for subsequent site development, consistent with the degree to which the adjacent development is benefited by such public improvements. Such reimbursement shall be on a pro rata basis determined in a reimbursement agreement entered into between the city and the initial developer. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1266, § 1, 2, 9-23-02; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1315, § 1, 12-8-03; Ord. No. 1481, § 5, 3-28-11; Ord. No. 1547 , § 6, 4-28-14)

(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1299, § 2, 7-14-03; Ord. No. 1352, § 2, 9-26-05; Ord. No. 1383, § 2, 5-14-2007; Ord. No. 1470, § 1, 8-23-10; Ord. No. 1471, § 5, 9-13-10; Ord. No. 1515, § 2, 7-9-12; Ord. No. 1523, § 1, 10-8-12) 
Sec. 26-113. - City-initiated rezoning. 
A.  Applicability. This rezoning procedure applies to rezonings initiated by city council. Applications for city initiated rezonings may be made with or without consent from affected property owners. City initiated rezonings may be to any zone district. In the event of a city-initiated zone change to a planned development district, the procedures in article III shall be followed, excluding the required authorization from property owners. In the event of a city-initiated amendment to a planned development district the procedures set forth in section 26-307 shall be followed, excluding the required authorization from property owners. 
B.  Procedure and notice: 
1.  General. The city council may, at a regular or special meeting, initiate this rezoning procedure by adoption of a resolution setting forth the general area of the proposed rezoning, stating the intended purpose and objectives to be achieved by the rezoning, and referring the matter to the planning commission for a public hearing and recommendation. 
a.  Prior to any public hearing before the planning commission, the city shall be required to hold a neighborhood meeting according to the requirements of section 26-109A. (See section 26-109A. for requirements.) 
b.  City-wide rezoning: Where a city-wide or comprehensive rezoning has been initiated by the council, notice shall include publication of a public hearing notice in a newspaper of general circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the public hearing, which notice shall include a description of the proposed rezoning and a map which illustrates the geographic extent of the proposed rezoning. 
c.  All other city-initiated rezonings: A city-initiated rezoning shall, in addition to the newspaper notice required by subsection b above, be noticed by certified mail notice sent to all owners of record of real property included within the area to be rezoned at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of public hearing. 
2.  Planning commission action. The planning commission shall hear and consider any evidence or statement presented by city staff or by any person in attendance at the hearing. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to city council to approve, approve with modifications or deny the rezoning proposal. The commission's recommendation shall be based upon the facts presented in the public hearing in consideration of the criteria for review specified in subsection 26-112D. 
3.  City council action. Upon receipt of the planning commission's recommendation, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposal. The hearing conducted on second reading of the proposed rezoning ordinance shall satisfy this requirement. Notice of the hearing shall be the same as for the planning commission hearing; however, publication of the ordinance on first reading, together with any required map, shall meet the newspaper publication requirement. The city council, in addition to consideration of the planning commission record, shall hear additional evidence and testimony presented and either approve, approve with modifications, or reject the ordinance. The city council shall base its decision upon all evidence presented, with due consideration of the criteria for review set forth under subsection 26-112.D. 
    In the event of a protest against such change of zone, signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of the area: 
1.  Of the property included within the proposed change; or 
2.  Of those immediately adjacent to the rear or any side of the property, extending one hundred (100) feet from the property; or 
3.  Of those directly opposite across the street from the property, extending one hundred (100) feet from the street frontage of such opposite property, such change shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the entire city council. Where land within the area proposed for change, or adjacent or opposite land, as defined above, is owned by the City of Wheat Ridge, such property shall be excluded in computing the required twenty (20) percent, and owners of non-city land within the one-hundred-foot limit, as defined above, shall be considered adjacent or opposite despite such intervening city land. The written protest to such change shall be submitted to the city council no later than the hearing on the proposed rezoning. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1316, § 2, 1-12-04; Ord. No. 1434, § 1, 3-9-09; Ord. No. 1515, § 4, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 26-114. - Special uses. 
A.  Purpose. Special uses are discretionary uses which, if properly designed, developed, operated and maintained, may be approved for any specific location within a zone district wherein the special use is enumerated. The primary issues to be addressed are those related to justification of need and special design and operational considerations which mitigate potential detrimental impacts of a special use on surrounding land uses, the street system, or public services or facilities. In order to protect the public interest, a special use may be approved, approved with modifications or denied. Previously approved special use permits may be revoked pursuant to subsection F. 
B.  Applicability. The requirements of this subsection shall apply to all uses listed as "special uses" within the provisions set forth for any particular zone district. Review of a special use application for an electrically charged fence is permitted in the zone districts listed in article 2 of this chapter, and in addition thereto, the planned commercial district (PCD) and the planned industrial district (PID). 
C.  Application form and review procedures: 
1.  Special use applications shall be originated only by the prospective owner of the proposed special use, with written approval of the fee owner of the property in cases where the owner of the property is different than the owner of the proposed special use. 
2.  Prior to submittal of an application for a special use, the applicant shall be required to hold a neighborhood input meeting according to the requirements of section 26-109.A. (See section 26-109.A for requirements.) 
3.  Reserved. 
4.  All applications shall also be accompanied by a site plan and additional written information in sufficient detail to convey the full intent of the applicant in developing, operating and maintaining the special use. The site development plan shall meet the minimum requirements outlined in section 26-111.C. 
5.  Upon receipt of a complete application packet, the community development department shall proceed with the following process: 
a.  Refer the application to affected public agencies for review and comment, if applicable. 
b.  After acceptance and review, the community development director shall notify adjacent property owners by letter notice and posting of the site for ten (10) days that a special use is requested for the property. 
c.  If no written objection to the proposed special use is received and the community development director finds that the proposed special use meets the criteria set forth in subsection D below, the community development director is authorized to approve the special use. Any objections must be directly related to the concerns regarding the request. General objections regarding existing land use conditions or issues not related to the request will not be considered grounds for objection. The community development director is further authorized to impose conditions or stipulations upon the special use, which may include physical design as well as operational and maintenance considerations, in addition to standard development and use regulations which apply within a particular zone district or for a similar "permitted use." Such conditions or stipulations may be imposed in order to ensure compliance with the criteria for review, which, if not complied with, shall be grounds for revocation of the special use pursuant to the procedures outlined in [subsection] F. 
d.  The community development director shall decide whether the particular special use is dependent upon design, management or operational aspects such that it be a personal grant of use to the owner of the special use and not a grant which transfers with the affected property, and, in that connection, the community development director shall decide whether the special use: 
(1)  Runs with the land in perpetuity; or 
(2)  Is personal to the applicant and may or may not be inherited; and/or 
(3)  Shall be granted only for a defined period, after which time the special use shall expire unless renewed subject to all of the requirements of this section. 
e.  If a written objection is received, or if the community development director finds that one or more of the criteria set forth in subsection D below for a special use are not met, or if the applicant objects to conditions of approval by the community development director, the community development director shall forward the request to the city council at a public hearing. Notice of said hearing shall be as provided in section 26-109. 
D.  Criteria for review. The community development director or city council shall base its decision in consideration of the extent to which the applicant demonstrates the following criteria have been met: 
[1.]  The special use will not have a detrimental effect upon the general health, welfare, safety and convenience of persons residing or working in the neighborhood. 
[2.]  The special use will not create or contribute to blight in the neighborhood by virtue of physical or operational characteristics. 
[3.]  The special use will not create adverse impacts greater than allowed under existing zoning for the property. 
[4.]  The special use will not result in undue traffic congestion or traffic hazards, or unsafe parking, loading, service or internal traffic conflicts to the detriment of persons whether on or off the site. 
[5.]  The property is appropriately designed, including setbacks, heights, parking, bulk, buffering, screening and landscaping, so as to be in harmony and compatible with the character of the surrounding areas and neighborhood, especially with adjacent properties. 
[6.]  The special use will not overburden the capacities of the existing streets, utilities, parks, schools and other public facilities and services. 
[7.]  There is a history of compliance by the applicant and/or property owner with Code requirements and prior conditions, if any, regarding the subject property. 
[8.]  The application is in substantial compliance with the applicable standards set forth in the Architectural and Site Design Manual. 
9.  The proposed special use promotes goals and outcomes from applicable portions of the city's comprehensive plan and any subarea plan applicable to the subject property. 
E.  City council review. City council shall review and decide upon all requests for special uses upon receipt of an objection by adjacent property owners or upon appeal by an applicant of a decision of denial by the community development director or of the conditions of approval by the community development director. Notice of public hearing shall be in the manner provided in section 26-109. 
1.  Council may impose conditions or stipulations upon the special use, which may include physical design as well as operational and maintenance considerations, in addition to standard development and use regulations which apply within a particular zone district or for a similar "permitted use." Such conditions or stipulations may be imposed in order to ensure compliance with the criteria for review, which, if not complied with, shall be grounds for revocation of the special use pursuant to procedures outlined in [subsection] F. 
2.  City council, shall hear additional evidence and testimony presented, and either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the special use, its decision being based upon all evidence presented, with due consideration of the criteria for review. 
3.  Grant of use. 
The city council shall also decide if the special use is dependent upon design, management or operational aspects such that it be a personal grant of use to the owner of the special use and not a grant which transfers with the affected property, and, in that connection, the city council shall decide whether the special use: 
(1)  Runs with the land in perpetuity; or 
(2)  Is personal to the applicant and may or may not be inherited; and/or 
(3)  Shall be granted only for a defined period, after which time the special use shall expire unless renewed subject to all of the requirements of this section. 
F.  Enforcement. All conditions and stipulations imposed by the community development director or city council shall be maintained during the entire term of the special use. If at any time the stipulations or conditions are not adhered to or are found to have been materially altered in scope, application or design, the director of community development shall investigate and, if appropriate, initiate revocation proceedings which shall include the following: 
1.  Notice of violation following procedures as set forth, in sections 26-1005 or 26-1006 of this Code. 
2.  Upon a finding of noncompliance after the prescribed correction date, the community development director shall schedule a revocation hearing before the city council. The purpose of the revocation hearing shall be for the city council to hear evidence concerning the nature and extent of the alleged noncompliance with the conditions of the special use permit. The council shall have the power, upon good cause being shown, to cancel or revoke the previously issued special use permit, to require certain corrective measures to be taken, and/or to direct the city's agents to enter upon the premises and take corrective measures required by the city council, and to modify the conditions which apply to the special use permit. 
G.  Term. 
1.  A special use permit is valid so long as the conditions of approval are maintained by the applicant, unless a specific time limit for the use or development is set forth as part of the permit approval by the community development director or city council. Except as otherwise provided herein, if an approved special use ceases operation for any reason for a period of one (1) year, the special use permit shall be deemed expired, unless otherwise provided in the permit itself. If an approved special use for a medical marijuana center, retail marijuana store or colocated center and store ceases operation for any reason for a period of six (6) months, the special use permit shall be deemed expired, unless otherwise provided in the permit itself. 
2.  If the conditions of a special use permit become the responsibility of a person or entity other than the applicant, the community development department shall be notified in writing, identifying the new person or entity responsible for maintaining the conditions of the permit. Until such notice is received, the applicant shall remain responsible for maintaining those conditions. The notice shall be attached to the permit on file with the community development department. A special use permit for a medical marijuana center, a retail marijuana store or a colocated center and store may be transferred to a person or entity other than the original applicant only upon the review and approval of the community development director. It shall be the burden of the proposed new permit holder to demonstrate that its continuation of the special use shall meet the special use review criteria set forth in section 26-114.D. 
H.  Nonconforming special uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26-120, any special use which is nonconforming to the provisions of this section by way of not having received approval of a special use permit under prior rules and procedures shall be allowed to continue. Any expansion, addition, or site modification shall require a special use review. All other provisions of section 26-120 shall apply.

Sec. 26-115. - Variance/temporary permits/interpretations. 
A.  Purpose. Where it is desired to gain relief from the strict application of any provision of this chapter or to seek an interpretation of the provisions or associated official maps, appeal to the appropriate authority as described below shall be made in accordance with the requirements relating to the specific type of appeal. Where a public hearing is required, notification shall occur by newspaper publication, posting, and letter as prescribed in section 26-109. 
B.  Application requirements. All requests for a variance, temporary permit or interpretation, as described herein, shall be made by the filing of an application, together with the required fee and supporting documentation. 
1.  Where a request covered within this subsection is made a part of another administrative process, then both fees shall be imposed. 
2.  Documentation required: 
a.  Copy of the deed for the property. 
b.  Power of attorney if the applicant is not the owner of the property. 
c.  Property survey if the request involves relationship of structure(s) to lot lines or lot area. 
d.  Reasons for filing an appeal or variance request. Requests for variances must include a brief description of the evidence supporting the conditions under which a variance can be granted as found in subsection C.4 hereof. 
e.  A "to scale" site plan. 
f.  Architectural elevations for any new structures. 
g.  Posting certification (to be submitted at the hearing to the clerk). 
h.  Other information which the applicant, the director of community development or the hearing authority determines is necessary in order to adequately evaluate the application. 
C.  Variances: 
1.  Administrative variances fifty (50) percent or less: The director of community development is empowered to decide upon applications for administrative variances from the strict application of any of the "development standards" pertaining to zone districts in article II and sections 26-501 (Off-street parking) and 26-502 (Landscaping requirements), and 26-603 (Fencing) and Article VII (Signage) of this chapter, which apply throughout the various zone district regulations and in other situations which may be specifically authorized in the various sections, without requirement of a public hearing, under the following conditions: 
a.  The variance does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the minimum or maximum standard; and 
b.  The director of community development finds that a majority of the criteria as set forth in subsection C.4 hereof, are substantially complied with and support the request; and 
c.  The director of community development has notified adjacent property owners by letter notice and posting of the site at least ten (10) days prior to rendering his decision, and that no objections have been received during such ten-day period. Any objections must be received in writing and be directly related to concerns regarding the request. General objections regarding existing land use conditions or issues not related to the request will not be considered grounds for objection. 
d.  That no additional dwelling units would result from approval of such variance. 
e.  In no instance shall the community development director hear or grant a variance as to use or as to an activity or development which is prohibited by this chapter nor shall the limitations of Charter section 5.10.1 be exceeded. 
2.  Administrative variance appeals: A decision by the community development director to deny an administrative variance or any conditions of approval imposed by the community development director may be appealed to the board of adjustment and shall follow procedures in accordance with section 2-61. A written appeal shall be submitted by the applicant to the community development department within ten (10) days of such administrative decision. 
3.  Variances of more than fifty (50) percent : The board of adjustment is empowered to hold public hearings to hear and decide only upon appeals for variances from the strict application of the development standards pertaining to zone districts in article II, sections 26-501, 26-503, 26-603 or article VII of this chapter. Where a variance is made a part of another administrative process, such as a change of zone, subdivision or a formal site plan or development plan review which requires a public hearing before the planning commission and/or city council, then the planning commission and/or city council shall be empowered to decide upon such variance request concurrent with such other process; however, in deciding such variance the planning commission and/or city council shall be subject to the voting ratio as applies to the board of adjustment, set forth in Wheat Ridge Code of Laws section 2-53. In no instance shall the board of adjustment hear or grant a variance as to use or as to an activity or development which is prohibited by this chapter or by Section 5.10.1 of the Charter. 
4.  Criteria for review: The community development director, board of adjustment, planning commission or city council shall base its decision in consideration of the extent to which the applicant demonstrates a majority of the following criteria have been met: 
a.  The property in question would not yield a reasonable return in use, service or income if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by regulation for the district in which it is located. 
b.  The variance would not alter the essential character of the locality. 
c.  The applicant is proposing a substantial investment in the property with this application, which would not be possible without the variance. 
d.  The particular physical surrounding, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved results in a particular and unique hardship (upon the owner) as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out. 
e.  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property. 
f.  The granting of the variance would not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located, by, among other things, substantially or permanently impairing the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, impairing the adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increasing the congestion in public streets or increasing the danger of fire or endangering the public safety, or substantially diminishing or impairing property values within the neighborhood. 
g.  The unusual circumstances or conditions necessitating the variance request are present in the neighborhood and are not unique to the property. 
h.  Granting of the variance would result in a reasonable accommodation of a person with disabilities. 
i.  The application is in substantial compliance with the applicable standards set forth in the Architectural and Site Design Manual. 
5.  Expiration: Any variance granted by the board of adjustment or director of community development shall automatically expire within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date it was granted, or within such other time as the board of adjustment or director of community development may prescribe, unless a building permit for the variance is obtained within such period of time. If the building permit expires, the variance shall expire at the same time. Extensions of time may be granted by the community development director for good cause shown, but only if an application for the extension is made prior to the expiration of the variance. 
D.  Temporary permit for uses, buildings, signs and nonoperative vehicles. 
1.  General. Temporary permits for uses, buildings and signs may be permitted subject to the following restrictions: 
a.  No application will be accepted for a temporary use, building or sign which has previously been denied by planning commission or city council. 
b.  The temporary use, building or sign shall be consistent with the character and intent of the zone district in which the use, building or sign is proposed and shall otherwise meet all development regulations for that zone district. 
c.  The approval of any temporary use, building or sign shall not be transferable or assignable to any other landowner, tenant, lessee or occupant. 
2.  One-month temporary permit: The director of community development is empowered to decide upon applications for temporary buildings, uses or signs which would not otherwise be permitted in a particular district, without requirement of a public hearing, under the following conditions: 
a.  The duration of the building, use or sign shall not exceed one (1) month; 
b.  No other temporary permit has been issued within the previous one (1) year for the same or similar building, use or sign on the same premises; 
c.  The director of community development shall determine that the "findings of fact," as set forth below are substantially complied with; 
d.  The director of community development has notified adjacent property owners in a form and manner as required for minor variances as set forth in section 26-109, and has received no objections. Any objections must be received in writing and be directly related to concerns regarding the request. General objections regarding existing land use conditions or issues not related to the request will not be considered grounds for objection; and 
e.  The owner or owner's agent approves in writing of the proposed temporary building, use or sign. 
If all of the conditions above are met, the director of community development may issue a one-month temporary permit; however, if they are not met, the director must deny the permit. The applicant may appeal a denial to the board of adjustment. 
An applicant may request renewal of a temporary permit for thirty (30) days. The zoning administrator may approve a renewal request only upon finding that the use, building or sign has complied with the findings of fact set forth for the original approval. Up to two (2) renewal requests may be requested by the applicant and approved by the director of community development. 
3.  One-year temporary permit for buildings or signs: 
a.  The board of adjustment is empowered to hold a public hearing to decide upon requests for temporary buildings or signs. The board may approve a temporary permit for no longer than one (1) year per application. 
b.  Only one (1) such permit may be approved per year for a particular site. No renewals of one-year permits or new permits for substantially the same building or sign shall be allowed. 
c.  In the event a city project necessitates the relocation of a use, the board of adjustment may approve such temporary use for a specified time period upon finding that a legitimate public purpose is served by granting the temporary use, in addition to the findings of fact required below for thirty-day temporary uses. 
4.  When hearing and deciding requests for temporary permits, director of community development or the board of adjustment shall base its decision in consideration of the following findings of fact: 
FINDINGS OF FACT: The proposed temporary building or sign: 
a.  Will not have a detrimental effect upon the general health, welfare, safety and convenience of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use; and 
b.  Will not adversely affect the adequate light and air, nor cause significant air, water or noise pollution, or cause drainage problems for the general area; and 
c.  Will not result in undue traffic congestion or traffic hazards, or unsafe parking, loading, service or internal traffic conflicts to the detriment of persons whether on or off the site; and 
d.  Will be appropriately designed, including setbacks, heights, parking, bulk, buffering, screening and landscaping, so as to be in harmony and compatible with character of the surrounding areas and neighborhood, especially with adjacent properties; and 
e.  Will not overburden the capacities of the existing streets, utilities, parks, schools, and other public facilities and services. 
5.  Temporary nonoperative vehicle permits. 
a.  The board of adjustment is empowered to hold public hearings to decide upon requests for temporary permits for nonoperative vehicles. 
b.  "Nonoperative" as applied to this ordinance shall be defined consistent with the definition provided in section 15-4 of the Nuisance Code. 
c.  The board may approve a temporary permit for no longer than one year per application. Each and every vehicle proposed for restoration shall be considered a separate application. A single extension for up to one year for each vehicle may be granted by the Board of Adjustment through a public hearing process. Extension requests for each vehicle will require a separate application for each vehicle. No renewals beyond the one-year extension will be allowed. 
d.  In addition to the application requirements listed in section 26-115.B., the applicant shall provide the following additional information: 
1.  VIN number for the vehicle being restored. 
2.  Anticipated time for restoration. 
3.  Site plan showing location of vehicle storage, type of parking surface, method of screening. 
e.  When hearing and deciding requests for temporary nonoperative vehicle permits, the board of adjustment shall base its decision in consideration of the following findings of fact. 
FINDINGS OF FACT: The proposed temporary nonoperative vehicle permit: 
1.  Will not alter the character of the locality; and 
2.  Will not contribute to blight in the neighborhood; and 
3.  Will be adequately screened from adjacent properties and public streets; and 
4.  Will not create environmental hazards (use of paint, body work, welding, ground contamination). 
The board of adjustment may also take into consideration the history of compliance, or of zoning violations by the applicant and any other factors relevant to the specific application. 
f.  The board of adjustment may impose conditions to ensure compliance with the criteria for review. These conditions may include, among others, length of permit, and limitations on scope of restoration (i.e. type of work-no body work or painting). Violations of the conditions imposed shall be grounds for revocation of the temporary nonoperative vehicle permit. 
g.  Any temporary nonoperative vehicle permit shall not be transferable or assignable to any other landowner, tenant, lessee or occupant. 
h.  The approval of a temporary nonoperative vehicle permit shall not be construed to mean that restoration of such vehicle is an allowed home occupation pursuant to section 26-613 of the zoning and development code. 
E.  Interpretations. The board of adjustment is empowered to hold public hearings to decide upon requests for interpretation of certain of the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry out their intent and purpose. This authority shall extend only to the following: 
1.  The basic intent and purpose of words, phrases or paragraphs as applied to a specific proposal or instance. 
2.  Use of property as an "other similar use;" however in no instance shall the board make an interpretation that a particular use may be permitted in a zone district where that use is specifically enumerated in a higher; that is more intensive, zone district. 
3.  Administrative decisions taken by the director of public works following final approval by the planning commission or city council, as appropriate, may be appealed to the board, which is empowered to reverse or modify such decisions, in whole or in part, upon a showing by the applicant that the effect of the director's decision would impose a particular and unique hardship upon the owner of the subject property, as distinguished from mere inconvenience, and which hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the subject property. 
F.  Appeals. Appeal of any decision of the board of adjustment or city council which either grants or denies applications for variances, temporary permits, or interpretations may be made by the applicant, the city council or any aggrieved party to district court within thirty (30) days of the decision. Appeal of any such decision of the planning commission may be made by the applicant, or any aggrieved party to the city council within ten (10) working days of the decision. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1286, § 1, 4-28-03; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1298, § 1, 7-14-03; Ord. No. 1383, § 3, 5-14-07; Ord. No. 1497, § 1, 9-12-11; Ord. No. 1547 , § 7, 4-28-14; Ord. No. 1548 , § 4, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-116. - Planned building groups (PBG). 
A.  Purpose. The primary purpose of this provision is to allow flexibility and diversification in the location of structures and the design and land use of a lot held under single or common ownership by permitting more than one (1) main structure to be constructed thereon. It promotes better overall utilization of a building site by promoting improved vehicular and pedestrian circulation and access, more efficient layout of parking and a better overall landscape and architectural design scheme for the total site, while at the same time ensuring adequate standards relating to public health, safety, welfare and convenience in the use and occupancy of buildings and facilities in planning building groups. 
B.  Scope and limitations. The procedures and provisions set forth in this section shall be applicable to all zone districts except planned development zone districts and mixed use zone districts, as those district regulations provide for multiple main structures on a lot under different procedures and provisions. It is not intended for this provision to be used to circumvent the requirements of the zoning ordinance for lot perimeter setbacks, lot size, lot coverage, residential density or any other provisions of the zoning ordinance except the requirement that only one (1) main building is permitted on one (1) lot. It also shall not be construed to waive any provisions of the subdivision regulations. Any subsequent division of a lot developed in accordance with the provisions set forth herein shall be required to meet all subdivision requirements. 
C.  Application procedures. All applications for planned building groups shall be filed with the department of community development by the owner of the entire land area to be included and shall be accompanied by the appropriate application fee, adequate proof of ownership, a certified survey of the parcel, and a site plan under section 26-111. 
D.  Review procedures: 
1.  Administrative review: The director of community development shall have the authority to review and approve, approve with modifications, or deny applications for planned building groups for no more than four (4) main structures on a single lot or parcel, except in the R-1 series, R-2 series and A-1 zone districts. Applications for more than four (4) main structures or more than one (1) main structure in the R-1 series, R-2 series and A-1 zone districts, and appeals by the applicant of the director of community development's decision, shall be forwarded to the planning commission for review. In reviewing such applications, the director of community development shall consider the standards for approval set forth below and shall have the authority to establish necessary conditions and limitations to carry out the intent of this section. 
2.  Planning commission review: The planning commission shall review all applications for planned building groups which exceed administrative review authority or upon applicant appeal of an administrative decision. Such application shall be heard at public hearings, with notification by neighborhood meeting, newspaper, letter and posting set forth in section 26-109. The decision by the planning commission shall be considered final. Appeal from a decision of the planning commission shall be to the Jefferson County District Court as specified in the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedures. 
3.  Standards for review: The director of community development and/or planning commission shall have the right to approve, establish necessary conditions and limitations in approving, or deny an application for a planned building group; provided, that the following standards shall be applied in such approval, denial or in establishing such conditions and limitations. The community development director or planning commission shall base its decision in consideration of the extent to which the applicant demonstrates the following criteria have been met: 
a.  The proposed plan complies with the zoning and development code and is not contrary to the general welfare of the immediate neighborhood and economic prosperity of the city. 
b.  The application is in substantial compliance with the applicable standards set forth in the Architectural and Site Design Manual. 
E.  Recording of planned building group plans. All approved planned building group plans, including all conditions and limitation stated thereon, shall be recorded in the office of the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder as an "official development plan," and no building or site preparation permits shall be issued on property subject to such plan until such plan has been duly recorded. All planned building group plans, together with associated recording fees, must be submitted to staff within sixty (60) days of the approval date, otherwise such approval may be reconsidered. The face of the plan will include the following: 
Declaration of Planned Building Group 
WHEREAS, ___________ (Insert name of all applicant(s) and owner(s)) have submitted a planned building group Plan for the City of Wheat Ridge's approval pursuant to Wheat Ridge Code of Laws, for the land area legally described as: ___________ (Insert legal description of entire land area to be covered by the planned building group); and 
WHEREAS, the City of Wheat Ridge has approved said plan on ________ (Insert date of approval) 
NOW, THEREFORE, upon final approval of the planned building group by the City of Wheat Ridge, this declaration is notice to prospective purchasers of the land area and to all others that it is the subject of a planned building group and that said plan and the ordinances relating thereto are binding on subsequent purchasers, successors and assigns unless the plan is abandoned, amended or withdrawn in writing and duly recorded and shall limit the construction, use and operation of all land and structures included within such plans to all conditions and limitations set forth in such plans and ordinances.

F.  Amendment or withdrawal of recorded planned building groups. Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements by which such plans were originally approved and recorded, planned building group plans may be amended or withdrawn, either partially or completely, if all land and structures remaining under such plans can be made to comply with all conditions and limitations of such plans and all land and structures withdrawn from such plans can be made to comply with all regulations and ordinances of the City of Wheat Ridge unrelated to any special plan hereunder. Planned building group plans which have been approved by the planning commission may have minor administrative adjustments or changes approved by the director of community development, provided that such adjustments or changes will not cause any of the following to occur: 
1.  A change in the character of the development; 
2.  An increase in the intensity of use; 
3.  A reduction in the originally approved separations or distances between buildings; 
4.  Any change which would create problems for circulation, safety or with utilities; 
5.  An increase of the external effects on adjacent property; 
6.  A reduction in the originally approved setbacks from property lines which would violate the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zone; 
7.  An increase in total floor area or of the ground covered by structures; 
8.  A reduction in the ratio of off-street parking and loading space to gross floor area in structures; or 
9.  An increase in approved residential densities. 
Any amendments to recorded planned building group plans, whether amended administratively or by action of the planning commission, shall be recorded with the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder in the same manner as the originally approved and recorded plan. Any withdrawal or partial withdrawal of an approved and recorded plan shall be certified by the recordation of a "declaration of withdrawal" of a planned building group. 
G.  Subdivision of land subject to planned building group plan. Where it is desired to subdivide a parcel of land, exclusive of condominium subdivision, which is either currently subject to, or is proposed to be subject to, the provisions of a planned building group plan, all requirements of the underlying zone district shall apply, except that setback from interior lot lines (that is lot lines not abutting public streets or abutting adjacent separately owned property) may be less than normally required if approved at the time of subdivision approval. In addition, any land or facilities used in common, such as, but not limited to drainage facilities and areas, common parking areas, ingress/egress drives, and landscaping or open space areas, shall be reserved by easement, or other acceptable instrument, for the continued right of common use of these areas or facilities. Maintenance of any such areas or facilities shall be the responsibility of the owner of each individual lot wherein such common area or facility lies, except that other property maintenance agreements may be acceptable if approved by the city attorney. 
H.  It is the intent of this section that subdivision review may be carried out simultaneously with the review of planned building group plans permitted herein. All requirements of the subdivision regulations, in addition to those of a planned building group plan, must be satisfied if there are any parcel divisions created, or if there are any dedications for streets or other public purposes. In cases where subdivision requirements are to be met as described herein, the applicant must submit separate sheet(s) in addition to the planned building group plan. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1352, § 3, 9-26-05; Ord. No. 1383, § 5, 5-14-07; Ord. No. 1471, § 6, 9-13-10; Ord. No. 1547 , § 8, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-117. - Development on multiple parcels or lots (consolidation plat or deed). 
A.  Requirement for consolidation plat. When a development requires the aggregation or consolidation of two (2) or more lots or parcels of land or portions thereof in order to accommodate such development, such shall be considered a development lot. Prior to issuance of a building permit in such instances, the owner shall file a consolidation plat. All requirements of the subdivision regulations must be satisfied. 
B.  Property merger covenant. Nonconforming lots of record may be merged as a condition of a permit or other development approval by a property merger covenant. A property merger covenant may be used in the event that an owner of two (2) or more adjacent lots which contain an existing residential use wishes to obtain a building permit for an accessory structure on the property or an addition to the existing structure. 
    The covenant shall ensure that the property be held as one (1) parcel and shall restrict any portion from being sold separately. The covenant shall be in a form approved by the city attorney, recorded in the office of the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder, and shall run with the land. The community development director shall have the authority to execute any such covenant and any release of the covenant on behalf of the city. 
C.  All consolidation plats for multifamily dwelling development shall be accompanied by a site plan, as set forth by section 26-111. Such consolidation plats, together with the site plan, shall be subject to review by the planning commission and city council following the same application procedures, notice requirements and approval procedures and standards for review as for a planned building group. The purpose of these provisions is to avoid the construction of overly large buildings which may negatively impact surrounding neighborhoods by increasing traffic, creating congestion by ingress/egress points, obstructing light and air and by making access for fire protection difficult, and to prevent construction of one (1) large building to avoid compliance with the subdivision regulations, and to encourage construction of smaller buildings which could give opportunities for better design of setbacks, landscaping, parking, vehicular and pedestrian circulation and drainage facilities. 
D.  Lots or parcels of land which are included in the Residential-3 (R-3) or Residential-3A (R-3A) zones and which are individually substandard for multifamily development, but which would meet the lot size and width requirement for single-family or two-family development, shall not be consolidated for the purpose of multifamily residential development unless the predominant adjacent land use is multifamily development of a similar density. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1547 , § 9, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-118. - Right-of-way vacations. 
    Street right-of-way vacations can occur by ordinance or by final plat and can be initiated by either the City of Wheat Ridge or by a private party. 
A.  Vacation by plat. When a street is being vacated as part of the platting process it shall be graphically shown and shall be designated as being "hereby vacated." The document for vacation in this instance shall follow the form and content of a final plat and shall be processed as a major subdivision in accordance with article IV. All submittal requirements of the platting process shall be provided by the applicant. There shall not be an additional charge for the processing of the vacation in this instance. 
B.  Vacation by ordinance. Applications for vacation by ordinance may also be originated by the City of Wheat Ridge or by a private property owner. If a city-initiated vacation, the department of public works shall prepare a legal description of the right-of-way proposed to be vacated attached to an administrative process application signed by the mayor of the City of Wheat Ridge or his or her representative. The filing fee in this instance shall be waived. The city will provide all other supplemental information required to process the city-initiated application. If a private party is applying for the vacation, he or she will be responsible for the preparation and submittal of an application package including the following items:

C.  Processing the application. Upon receipt of a complete application, the department of community development shall proceed with the following process: 
1.  Refer the application to affected public agencies, city departments and utilities for review and comment. 
2.  After acceptance and review, staff will give notice of a scheduled public hearing on the application by the planning commission with notice by publication, letter and site posting in the manner provided in section 26-109B, C and D. 
3.  Prepare a written report to the planning commission which evaluates the proposal, makes findings, and recommendations using the review criteria set forth below. 
D.  Criteria for review. Before a street right-of-way vacation is approved, the applicant shall show and city council shall make the following determinations: 
1.  That the proposed vacation will not leave any adjoining land without access to an established public right-of-way. 
2.  That the proposed vacation is in conformity with the most recently enacted goals and policies of the transportation section of the current comprehensive plan of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
3.  That the proposed vacation will not have a negative impact on the infrastructure of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
4.  That adequate easements have been reserved for use and/or maintenance by the city or other utility agencies. 
E.  Planning commission review. Planning commission shall hear and consider any evidence or statement presented by the applicant, city staff, or by any person in attendance at the hearing. The planning commission shall then make a recommendation to city council to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application, basing its recommendations on the facts presented in the public hearing as applied to the criteria for review as specified in subsection D., hereof. Planning commission may recommend conditions or stipulations, which may include use limitations or operational stipulations such as reservation of utility easements or access easements. 
F.  City council review. City council shall review and decide upon all requests for right-of-way vacations, upon recommendation of planning commission for approval, approval with conditions of denial.

Notice of public hearing shall be by publication, letter and site posting in the manner provided in subsection C., hereof. City council in addition to consideration of the planning commission record shall hear additional evidence and testimony presented and either approve, approve with modifications, or deny the ordinance. City council shall base its decision upon all evidence presented, with due consideration of the criteria for review as set forth under subsection D., hereof.

G.  Recordation. All approved vacation ordinances or plats with street vacations shall be recorded with the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder by the city within sixty (60) days of the effective date of such ordinance or plat approval. 
H.  Vesting of title. When a right-of-way is vacated, title to the vacated right-of-way shall vest with adjacent property owners or the original grantor or its successors-in-interest as provided by C.R.S. § 43-23-01, et seq. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1352, § 4, 9-26-05; Ord. No. 1547 , § 10, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-119. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility for the utilization of properties that contain uncertain or multiple zoning district boundaries. The city recognizes that these properties may present a challenge for physical improvements. The intent is to accommodate adjustments and corrections to the official zoning map that are minor in nature and that may result in physical improvements to property. 
B.  Zoning district boundaries uncertain. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following shall apply: 
1.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
2.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
3.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits. 
4.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
5.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. In the event of a natural change in the shoreline or centerline, the district boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline or centerline. In the event of a change directly or indirectly the result of human actions, the district boundary shall not be construed as following the new shoreline or centerline. 
6.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections 1. through 5. shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the legal description as contained in a rezoning ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council, or, if the zoning pre-dates the adoption of Ordinance No. 98, adopted on May 2, 1972, shall be determined by measurement of the official zoning map currently in effect. 
7.  Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are different than those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by this section, the community development director shall interpret the district boundaries in accordance with procedures set forth in subsection 26-119E. 
8.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following section lines or division lines of sections (i.e. quarter-section lines) shall be construed to follow such land lines. 
C.  Lot line adjustments and right-of-way vacations. 
1.  A zoning district boundary shown on the official zoning map as approximately following a property line shall be construed as following the property line as it actually existed at the time the zoning district boundary was established. If, subsequent to the establishment of the zoning district boundary, a property line is moved as a result of a legally performed property line adjustment pursuant to articles I and IV of this chapter, as applicable (including right-of-way dedications and vacations), the zoning district boundary line shall be construed as moving simultaneously with the property line if the community development director determines that each of the following apply: 
a.  The property line adjustment is minor in nature; 
b.  The corresponding adjustment in the zoning is consistent with the goals, objectives and intent of the comprehensive plan; and 
c.  The adjustment is consistent with the general zoning pattern in the area. 
2.  If the above requisite conditions are satisfied, the community development director may direct that the official zoning map be adjusted pursuant to subsection E below. If any of these conditions are not satisfied the zoning district boundary may only be moved pursuant to the rezoning process set forth in section 26-112. 
D.  Lots with two or more zoning districts. Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot that has single ownership at the time of the passage of section 26-119 of this Code, zoning and use of the lot shall be governed by one of the following provisions, as elected by the community development director. (See Figure 26-119.1.): 

1.  The lot shall be considered to be in the zoning district in which the majority of the land area of the lot falls, provided that the lower intensity zone district is utilized in accordance with Figure 26-119.2 and the zone district to be utilized is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan at the sole discretion of the community development director or until such time as a rezoning is sought pursuant to section 26-112 of this Code; or 
2.  Each portion of that lot so divided may be used in conformity with and subject to the regulations applicable to the district in which it is located; or 
3.  The community development director may make an administrative adjustment to the official zoning map in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 26-119E. below. 
4.  Properties under one ownership that exceed one (1) acre in size may only be used in accordance with subsection 2 above. 
E.  Administrative and minor adjustments to the official zoning map. Where the zoning district boundary cannot be interpreted in accordance with subsections B. through D. above, the community development director may make an administrative adjustment in accordance with this subsection E. 
1.  Procedure for administrative adjustments. An application for an adjustment to the official zoning map may be made to or initiated by the community development director. The community development director may administratively amend the official zoning map under the following conditions: 
a.  The adjustment does not extend the zone district boundary more than 50 feet; 
b.  The property subject to the adjustment does not exceed one (1) acre in size; 
c.  The adjustment is consistent with and does not violate this Code, the City Charter, the comprehensive plan, or any other applicable rules and regulations of the city; and 
d.  The community development director has notified adjacent property owners by letter notice and posting of the site at least ten (10) days prior to rendering his decision, and that no objections have been received during such ten day period. Any objections must be received in writing and be directly related to the proposed boundary adjustment. General objections regarding existing land use conditions or issues unrelated to the boundary adjustment will not be considered valid objections for purposes of this provision. 
e.  If the community development director initiates an administrative adjustment, the procedures set forth in subsections a.-d. above shall be followed after the following conditions are satisfied: 
i.  The community development director shall notify the current property owner by certified mail of the adjustment; and 
ii.  If within thirty (30) days of said notice the owner fails to submit a written protest to the adjustment, the director is authorized to initiate the adjustment in accordance with subsections a-d above. 
f.  Fees for administrative adjustments shall be equal to those for administrative variances as set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
2.  Appeals. 
a.  Appeals of the community development director's decisions and interpretations under this section may be taken to city council by the subject property owner or an adjacent property owner. A written appeal must be received by the community development department within ten (10) days of issuance of the appealed decision. 
b.  The city council shall conduct a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing shall be given in the manner provided in section 26-109. Council shall hear additional evidence and testimony presented and affirm, reverse or modify the community development director's decision or interpretation after considering the applicable criteria and standards. 

3.  Minor corrections. The community development director may, from time to time, make minor corrections to the official zoning map as set forth below: 
a.  Subdivisions. Corrections to name of subdivisions, locations of lot lines and boundary lines, location and names of streets and alleys and railroads. 
b.  Base map. Corrections to watercourse locations or names, location or names of lakes, names or location of street or railroads. 
c.  Zoning information. Corrections to names of planned developments, case numbers, and closure of zone districts in accordance with the most recent record of zoning action where there is no zoning line separation between two (2) different zone districts. 
d.  Verifiable errors. Where a verifiable error is discovered in the zone classification of any particular parcel as displayed on the official zoning map, or as represented in a rezoning ordinance, the community development director shall notify the current property owner by certified mail of the error and shall inform the owner of the intent to correct the error based upon the record of the last rezoning action. The director shall also notify city council of the proposed correction by memorandum, including documentation which supports the corrective action. If within thirty (30) days of the date of notice to the property owner, he or she fails to submit a written protest to the correction, the director may correct the error and shall publish a legal notice of the correction. However, if the owner does file a written protest, a rezoning action shall be initiated. The rezoning action shall be subject to the provisions of section 26-112 except that no fee shall be assessed. 
e.  Miscellaneous corrections. At any time minor corrections to the official zoning map which do not affect the zoning of any parcel may be made with the approval of the community development director and with a note added under the "revisions" box on said map, indicating that an "administrative correction" has been made, a case file shall be created with a case number assigned for each correction, with information contained in the file which gives the location and nature of the correction. 
(Ord. No. 1430, § 1, 2-23-09) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1430, § 1, adopted February 23, 2009, amended section 26-119, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, section 26-119 pertained to zoning and mapping corrections, and derived from Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, adopted February 26, 2001 and Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, adopted May 12, 2003. 
Sec. 26-120. - Nonconforming lots, uses and structures. 
A.  Scope and intent. 
1.  Within the districts created by the adoption of this zoning code, or by the adoption of amendments, there may exist lots, structures or uses of land and structures which were legal prior to the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter but which are now prohibited or regulated. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are voluntarily removed, or until they are amortized, but not to encourage their survival. It is further intended that these nonconformities will not be enlarged, expanded, or extended, nor will they be used as grounds for adding other uses or structures prohibited in the district. In cases where a nonconformity constitutes an eminent public safety hazard or threat, the nonconforming situation may be ordered corrected or removed. 
2.  Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued or a use of land or structure for which a use permit has been granted prior to the effective date of enactment or amendment of this chapter which created the nonconformity may be completed and used in accordance with the plans, specifications and permit on which the building or use permit was granted, if construction in the case of a building, or occupancy in the case of use, is commenced within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit and diligently carried to completion or occupancy. 
B.  Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family residence and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record, provided that the lot is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots under the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements of the district in which it is located for area, width, or both; provided, however, that the requirements of the district for minimum yard dimensions and lot coverage shall be met. 
    If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record, and part or all of the lots do not meet the requirements of the district in which they are located as to minimum area or frontage or both, the lands shall be considered to be an undivided parcel and no portion of the parcel shall be sold or used in a manner which diminishes compliance with minimum lot width and area requirements. 
C.  Nonconforming structures and uses. Where a structure or use lawfully existed at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter which could not be built or maintained under the current requirements of this chapter because of lot area, lot coverage, required yards or the location of the structure on the lot, such structure or use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following. 
1.  Any one- or two-family dwelling structure or customary accessory structures may be enlarged, altered or added to provided that all lot coverage requirements of the zoning district in which the structure is located are met, and provided that the enlargement, alteration or addition does not increase the extent of nonconforming setbacks by encroaching beyond the existing setback line. The residential bulk plane standards set forth in subsection 26-642 A. shall apply to any enlargement, alteration or addition of or to both the primary structure and any accessory structures to the primary structure. In instances of corner lots, no enlargement, alteration or addition shall be permitted to encroach within the minimum sight distance triangle as set forth in subsection 26-603 B. In addition, no enlargement, alteration or addition which extends within the nonconforming area shall result in the development of any additional dwelling units. 
2.  If any structure or nonconforming portion thereof is demolished or reconstructed by the owner to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the applicable provisions of this chapter. 
3.  If any structure should for any reason be moved from its location at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, it shall conform to the provisions of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
4.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
5.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of the building which was designed or arranged for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. In addition, no such use shall be extended to any portion of the property outside of any building which was not used for said nonconforming use at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter creating said nonconforming use. 
6.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever any nonconforming use of a structure, or land, or a structure and land in combination is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months the structure, or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be devoted to a use not permitted in the district in which is located. Nonconforming medical marijuana establishment uses and retail marijuana establishment uses may not resume in the same location after such nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months. Nonconforming residential structures and uses are exempt from the provisions of this subparagraph. Rezoning or special use permit applications for properties which are nonconforming uses at the time of application, and where these applications are intended to bring the nonconforming use into use conformance, shall not be charged application fees or be required to reimburse the city for direct expenses related to the application review process. 
7.  Setback encroachments for accessory buildings may be allowed where the principal structure encroaches into required setbacks in accordance with section 26-625. 
8.  A nonconforming structure, or a structure that contains a nonconforming use that has been involuntarily damaged in whole or in part by fire, flood, wind or other calamity may be restored to its original size and scope, provided such work is in compliance with all technical codes adopted under Chapter 5, article III of this Code. Restoration work shall commence within six (6) months of the damage occurring and shall be completed within twelve (12) months of the date on which the restoration commenced. 
9.  No use or structure originally nonconforming which is rendered conforming may be returned to its nonconforming use or form. 
D.  Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done during any one-year period on ordinary repairs, or on repair and replacement of nonbearing wall fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming is not increased. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure devoted to a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and it is declared by the director of community development to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, rebuilt or repaired except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protection of the public safety. 
E.  Exceptions. 
1.  Government actions. Whenever the City of Wheat Ridge or the State of Colorado shall, through a purchase, condemnation or a required dedication of land for street widening or extension purposes, cause any lot, structure or use maintained upon that lot to become nonconforming in the areas of setback, area of lot, or parking and landscape requirements, the existing lot, structure or use, which would otherwise become nonconforming, shall be considered conforming, subject to the following: 
a.  The nonconformity that was created by street right-of-way widening or extension was not anticipated by adopted plans which were in effect as of the date of commencement of the original construction or use; and 
b.  Any nonconformity other than those created by the above-described governmental action, and which existed prior to the date of the governmental action, shall be considered a nonconformity which is subject to the remaining provisions of this section. 
2.  Variances and waivers. Any lot or structure which is granted a variance or waiver in accordance with section 26-115 shall not be deemed a nonconforming lot or structure. 
3.  Private roadways. Dwellings or other structures existing in the City of Wheat Ridge on private roads or legally recorded easements shall not be considered to be nonconforming by virtue of such cases. 
F.  Miscellaneous nonconformities. Existing uses and/or developed lands which are nonconforming due to ingress/egress, landscaping, parking, signage or public improvements may be continued notwithstanding the provisions of subsections C. and D., above; provided, however, that any reconstruction, enlargement or addition meets the specific nonconforming provisions related to the particular nonconformity as specified in the appropriate section. (See section 26-501 for parking and ingress/egress; section 26-502 for landscaping; article VII for signs; and section 26-110 for public improvements.) 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1448, § 1, 8-24-09; Ord. No. 1471, § 7, 9-13-10; Ord. No. 1563 , § 13, 1-26-15; Ord. No. 1613 , § 2, 11-21-16) 
Editor's note- Temporary Ord. No. 1602 amended §§ 26-120, 26-123, 26-208, and 26-611 for 90 days starting on its adoption date of August 22, 2016. Ord. No. 1613 replaced it on a permanent basis to amend the Code. 
Sec. 26-121. - Vested property rights. 
A.  Purpose. Pursuant to the provisions of Article XX, Section 6 of the Constitution of the State of Colorado, the electors of the city have adopted a Home Rule Charter. The law is, and has for many years been, clear and certain that adoption of a Home Rule Charter vests the citizens of a home rule city, and the legislative body thereof, with the power and authority to enact legislation on matters of purely local concern, which legislation preempts and supersedes state legislation as to those matters of purely local concern. Zoning is and has on numerous occasions been declared and confirmed by the Colorado Supreme Court as being a matter of purely local concern. The purpose of this section is to state the intent of the City of Wheat Ridge to guard jealously its rights and powers as a home rule city to enact local zoning regulations which supersede and preempt state legislation in the area of zoning. 
B.  Vested rights. The City of Wheat Ridge is aware of C.R.S. § 24-68-101, et seq. The City of Wheat Ridge rejects the assertion that the subject matter of that statute is "a matter of statewide concern," and, therefore, determines that the provisions of C.R.S. § 24-68-101, et seq. are expressly superseded and preempted within the City of Wheat Ridge by the provisions of this section. 
C.  Creation of vested rights. No vested right is created within the City of Wheat Ridge by the approval of any application for zoning or rezoning, site plan, consolidation plan, subdivision plan or plat, planned building group, or an outline or specific development plan. Rather, a vested property right shall be created if, after a building, grading or fill permit has been lawfully issued, the successful applicant, owner or permit holder (expressly provided that approval has been granted and/or a permit has been issued in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and not based upon a "misrepresentation of fact or a mutual mistake of fact") has taken lawful, reasonable and substantial steps, and has incurred lawful, reasonable and substantial expenses, in justifiable reliance upon the approval or permit. The intent of this provision is to adopt the common law of estoppel in pais as that doctrine existed on June 30, 1987, as the law of vested property rights within the City of Wheat Ridge. 
D.  Notice concerning vested rights. Ordinances approving requests for zoning/rezoning of property, and ordinances, resolutions or motions approving plans, plats, site plans or any other required submission, shall contain the following statement: 
"Approval of this (ordinance, plan, plat, etc.,) does not create a vested property right. Vested property rights may only arise and accrue pursuant to the provisions of section 26-121 of the Code of Laws of the City of Wheat Ridge." 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1515, § 5, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 26-122. - Zoning code amendments. 
A.  Requests or proposals for amendments. Requests or proposals to amend this code may be initiated by city council, the mayor, planning commission, board of adjustment, the city attorney, the city manager, or the director of community development. 
    Any proposal to amend the zoning code shall be referred to the planning commission and shall be scheduled for hearing within thirty (30) days of its referral and a recommendation to approve, to modify, or to deny the proposal shall be rendered by the planning commission within sixty (60) days of such referral. Failure to make a recommendation to city council within sixty (60) days shall be deemed a recommendation for approval without comments. Any other party requesting or suggesting amendments shall make application to the planning commission for consideration on a future agenda as a study matter. 
B.  Planning commission hearing: A public hearing shall be scheduled before the planning commission and the planning commission shall hear and make recommendation to city council upon all proposals to amend the zoning code. Notice of the public hearing shall be by a notice published in a newspaper of general circulation at least seven (7) days prior to said hearing. 
C.  City council hearing: All amendments to the zoning code shall be approved only by the passage of an ordinance. The ordinance shall specify those provisions which are being enacted, repealed, modified otherwise changed. After passage upon first reading, a notice of public hearing, together with the council bill, shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation, no less than seven (7) days prior to a public hearing before city council. Council shall hold a public hearing on all requests and proposals recommended to it by the planning commission, and shall approve, approve with modifications, or deny the request or proposal. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03)

Sec. 26-301. - Scope and application. 
A.  District created. There is hereby created a planned development district to further promote the public health, safety and general welfare by permitting greater flexibility and innovation in land development based upon a comprehensive, integrated plan. For the purpose of ensuring maximum flexibility of this district, the district is divided into the following planned development zone district categories, based on the primary land use of a proposed development plan or portion thereof: 
1.  Planned Residential Development-PRD. 
2.  Planned Commercial Development-PCD. 
3.  Planned Industrial Development-PID. 
4.  Planned Hospital Development-PHD. 
5.  Planned Mixed Used Development-PMUD. 
    The city council recognizes these zone district categories may exist singly or in combination within any approved planned development. 
B.  Applicability. On and after the effective date of this chapter as set forth in section 26-1003, all applications for a zone change shall be to a planned development district where any one (1) of the following conditions exist: 
1.  An application for a zone change to any commercial district, with the exception of a rezoning to any mixed use district or to the industrial-employment zone district, for properties of any size. 
2.  An application for a zone change to any residential or agricultural district for property over one (1) acre in size, or for which an applicant owns adjacent property which, taken together with the property that is the subject of the application, totals more than one (1) acre. 
    This article shall apply to: 
1.  Any new application for a rezoning to a planned development district. 
2.  Any application for amendment to an existing planned development zone district. 
C.  Purpose. The intent of the planned development district is to permit the establishment of well-designed, innovative developments which may not be feasible under a standard zone district, but which may be permitted through the use of an approved development plan by assuring greater control and specificity of intended development character, use, operations and maintenance, while at the same time allowing flexibility and diversity. 
    While the city council recognizes that planned developments may vary certain design and other requirements, the planned development process may not be used to circumvent the intent and spirit of the protections afforded by this chapter. 
    The planned development district recognizes the great variety of land use intensities, densities, and environmental and land use interfaces which are possible. The general purposes of this article are as follows: 
1.  To accommodate extraordinary or unique development proposals that are not feasible under standard zone districts. 
2.  To accomplish compatible development with adjacent commercial, residential and/or industrial land uses through proper land use transitions and buffering techniques. 
3.  To promote flexibility in design and permit diversification in the location of structures. 
4.  To promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of building, circulation systems, land use and utilities. 
5.  To preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and to minimize impacts on other natural features of the site. 
6.  To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within the planned developments. 
7.  To promote conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan, established policies and guidelines for the area and for the community. 
(Ord. No. 1515, § 1, 7-9-12; Ord. No. 1523, § 6, 10-8-12) 
Sec. 26-302. - Planned development review procedures. 
A.  Development plans. There are two (2) distinct steps in establishing a planned development: approval of an outline development plan (ODP) and approval of a specific development plan (SDP). The first approval process includes a zone change to a planned development district and approval of an outline development plan. The second approval process is for specific site design and architecture, and includes approval of the specific development plan. Both phases of approval include public hearings subject to the provisions of sections 26-303 and 26-305. 
B.  Sequence of related applications. 
1.  Applications for outline and specific development plans may be submitted concurrently or sequentially. 
2.  If platting is required, subdivision or plat review may be carried out simultaneously with the review of the specific development plan. Generally, subdivision review is required if a proposed development dedicates right-of-way for streets, easements or other public lands; amends a previously approved subdivision; or creates parcel divisions. Article IV of this chapter should be consulted for subdivision requirements and procedures. 
(Ord. No. 1515, § 1, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 26-303. - Outline development plan review procedures. 
    The applicant shall submit an outline development plan for approval of a zone change to a planned development district. The outline development plan establishes the zoning, overall development concepts, permitted uses, and development parameters. It also provides a general graphic layout of proposed building pads and proposed circulation concepts. 
A.  Review procedure. An outline development plan is processed and approved concurrently with a zone change to a planned development district, subject to the following review procedure: 
1.  Preapplication conference. Prior to submitting any zone change application for a planned development district, the applicant must participate in a preapplication conference, as described in section 26-104. 
2.  Preapplication neighborhood meeting. After the preapplication conference, but prior to submitting any zone change application for a planned development district, the applicant shall be required to hold a neighborhood input meeting, as described in section 26-109.A. 
3.  Application filing. An outline development plan application shall be submitted to the community development department. Staff will review the application for completeness in accordance with the submittal requirements in section 26-304. If staff determines the application is not complete, it will be returned to the applicant and not further processed until the incomplete items have been supplied. 
4.  Review and referral. Upon receipt of a complete application packet the community development department shall proceed with the following process: 
a.  Staff will review the application and refer the application to affected departments and agencies for review and comment. The applicant must address all comments and resubmit relevant documents. 
b.  After the review period, staff will give notice of scheduled public hearing(s) on the application with notice by publication, letter, and site posting in the manner provided in section 26-109. 
c.  Staff will prepare a written report to the planning commission which evaluates the proposal, makes findings, and makes recommendations using the review criteria set forth below in section 26-303.D. 
5.  Planning commission review. The planning commission shall hear and consider any evidence or statement presented by the applicant, city staff, or by any person in attendance at the public hearing. The planning commission shall then make a recommendation to city council to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application, basing its recommendation upon the facts presented in the public hearing in consideration of the criteria for review as specified in section 26-303.D. 
6.  City council review. City council shall review and decide upon all requests for approval of an outline development plan, upon recommendation of the planning commission for approval, approval with conditions, or for denial. Change of zone may only be approved by passage of an ordinance following the city's standard ordinance adoption procedures, including a first reading and public hearing. City council, in addition to consideration of the planning commission record, shall hear additional evidence and testimony presented and either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the ordinance. City council shall base its decision upon all evidence presented, with due consideration of the criteria for review as specified in section 26.303.D. 
7.  In the event of a legal protest against the rezoning component of the planned development approval, under the procedure set forth in section 5-10 of the home rule charter, a zone change shall not be approved except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the entire city council. The written protest to such change shall be submitted to the city council no later than the hearing on the proposed rezoning ordinance. 
B.  Recording. All approved outline development plans shall be recorded with the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder. Such plans and associated recording fees shall be submitted to the community development department within sixty (60) days of council's final action. 
Should a recordable approved outline development plan not be provided to staff within sixty (60) days of council's final action, staff shall schedule a public hearing before city council and city council shall reconsider its approval. A one-time, thirty-day extension for mylar submittal may be requested from the community development director. The request must be submitted in writing prior to expiration of the sixty-day time limit showing evidence of good cause for not meeting the deadline. 
C.  Modifications or amendments. The process for approving amendments to an outline development plan is the same as for the original approval, as described in section 26-308. 
D.  Criteria for review. The planning commission and city council shall base their decision in consideration of the extent to which the applicant demonstrates the following criteria have been met: 
1.  The change of zone promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and will not result in a significant adverse effect on the surrounding area; and 
2.  The development proposed on the subject property is not feasible under any other zone district, and would require an unreasonable number of variances or waivers and conditions; and 
3.  Adequate infrastructure/facilities are available to serve the types of uses allowed by the change of zone, or the applicant will upgrade and provide such where they do not exist or are under capacity; and 
4.  At least one (1) of the following conditions exists: 
a.  The change of zone is in conformance, or will bring the property into conformance with, the City of Wheat Ridge comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies, and other city-approved policies or plans for the area. 
b.  The existing zone classification currently recorded on the official zoning maps of the City of Wheat Ridge is in error. 
c.  A change of character in the area has occurred or is occurring to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage redevelopment of the area or to recognize the changing character of the area. 
d.  The proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide for a community need that was not anticipated at the time of the adoption of the City of Wheat Ridge comprehensive plan.

All applications for amendment to an outline development plan must be approved in writing by at least twenty-five (25) percent of the owners of real property contained within the area originally approved by the outline development plan, unless specific alternative provisions for amendment have been approved by city council as part of the unified control agreement. Additionally, if the amendment affects the provisions for access, drainage, utilities and/or circulation, affected property owners, as determined by the community development director, must also consent to the application for amendment in writing. 
    An amendment to an approved outline development plan shall require a new application, subject to the same procedures and requirements as for the original approval, if any of the following conditions exist: 
1.  Substantial changes that alter the character of the development. 
2.  Any change to the development parameters on the outline development plan, including, but not limited to: 
a.  An increase in the gross floor area of structures beyond the authorized maximum allowed on the approved outline development plan.

At no time may approval of a specific development plan result in any increase beyond a maximum development standard or any decrease below a minimum development standard as listed on the outline development plan. If any of these conditions occur, the outline development plan must be amended, as described in subsection B above. 
    An amendment to a specific development plan must be approved in writing by only the owners of the real property for which the amendment is being requested. Amendments may be initiated by property owners within an approved development plan. If the amendment affects the provisions for access, drainage, utilities and/or circulation, affected property owners, as determined by the community development director, must also consent to the application for amendment in writing. 
1.  Administrative review. The community development director may approve minor amendments to a specific development plan which, in the reasonable judgment of the community development director, do not affect neighboring properties or the overall character of the development. These may include variations to buildings orientation, parking lots, landscaping areas, architectural details, interior setbacks, and similar variations that meet the review criteria set forth below in section 26-308.C.3. Administratively approved amendments are not required to be recorded, but should be kept on file in the community development department.

The director and planning commission may impose conditions upon any amendment to ensure the proposal complies with the purpose and intent of the original approval. 
D.  Variances. Variances to the strict application of development standards established by an outline or specific development plan may be requested only for properties within single- and two-family planned residential developments. The applicable administrative or non-administrative variance process shall be followed as prescribed in section 26-115. 
E.  Existing planned developments. For planned developments approved prior to the effective date of Ordinance 1515, Series 2012, amendments may be reviewed based on the provisions of this article or based on the regulations under which the planned development was originally approved. The procedure for processing amendments will be determined on a case by case basis by the community development director and communicated to the applicant(s) at the pre-application conference. In most cases, for the purpose of amendments, an existing outline development plan will be treated as an outline development plan under these regulations; an existing final development plan will be treated as a specific development plan. 
(Ord. No. 1515, § 1, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 26-308. - Interpretation of development plans. 
A.  Detailed specifications and standards which should have been set forth on approved outline and specific development plans, but which were found subsequent to approval to have been omitted, may be interpreted by the community development director to be those specifications and standards set forth in the zone district in which the approved uses contained within the approved development plan would be permitted. 
B.  The supplementary regulations of article VI apply to uses and activities within planned development districts, unless otherwise provided in the approved development plan. 
C.  If the outline and specific development plans do not address a particular development standard, the standard of the zone district which most closely matches the planned development as determined by the community development director shall be used. The owner of any property aggrieved by such determination may appeal the interpretation to the board of adjustment pursuant to the provisions of section 26-115.E. 
D.  It the development standards specified on a recorded outline development plan do not meet the current standards of chapter 26, a specific development plan can nevertheless be approved so long as the specific development plan complies with the approved outline development. This provision does not apply to requirements listed under article IV subdivision regulations.

B.  Authority. No final plat of a subdivision shall be approved and accepted by staff, the planning commission or the city council unless it conforms to the provisions of these regulations. Pursuant to the authority contained in Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution and in C.R.S. §§ 29-20-101 et seq., 31-23-101 et seq., and 24-67-101 et seq., the Wheat Ridge planning commission and city council are vested with the power and authority to adopt and amend these subdivision regulations. 
C.  Purpose. The intent of these regulations is to prepare land for development and to recognize that the arrangement of parcels, streets, and infrastructure has a direct impact on the character and environment of the city. The general purposes of this article are as follows: 
1.  To protect the health, safety, and welfare of present and future residents of the city. 
2.  To promote orderly growth and good planning practice. 
3.  To guide land development that is consistent with the city's adopted plans and zoning regulations.

B.  General applicability. 
1.  These subdivision regulations shall apply to the creation or boundary modification of lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land for any purpose, including but not limited to its immediate or future sale, transfer, or development, whether residential, industrial, office, business or otherwise. 
2.  This article shall apply to a resubdivision or any division of land previously subdivided or platted, as well as to a lot line adjustment or consolidation of two (2) or more lots, tracts, or parcels. 
3.  The transfer of any portion of land by the use of description for the purpose of sale, transfer, lease or development is prohibited until the division of land is approved and recorded in accordance with these subdivision regulations. 
4.  No subdivision plat shall be used for purposes of sale or development until the plat is approved and recorded in accordance with these subdivision regulations. 
C.  Exemptions. This article shall not apply to the following: 
1.  Any division of a tract of land into separate parcels of at least thirty-five (35) acres each for the purposes of sale; 
2.  Any division of land which is created by order of any court in this state or by operation of law, such as settlement of an estate; 
3.  Any division of land which is created by a foreclosure of a deed of trust, lien, mortgage or any other security instrument;

The intent of this exception is to ensure that the area and setback requirements for structures are met, but to allow subsequent division of an individual structure and associated land into separate ownership, as with duplex splits or condominium plats. This exception shall not apply whenever it is desired to sell off land for the purpose of creating a new building site; 
7.  Vacant nonconforming parcels of record as described in section 26-120;

E.  Private covenants. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction. It is not the intent of these regulations that the city will enforce any private easement, covenant, agreement, or restriction; such provisions being a function of the right of individual property owners to further or separately restrict the use of their property as one (1) of the rights attendant upon property ownership. These regulations shall not be interpreted to either enhance or diminish such private restrictions, and the existence of such private restrictions shall neither enhance nor diminish the application or enforceability of these regulations.

(Ord. No. 1547 , § 1, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 26-414. - Dedication of public parks and sites. 
A.  Public parks and trails. 
1.  Purpose. Parkland dedication is based on the presumption that new residents create additional demands for and burdens on park, trail, open space, and recreation facilities. Land dedication for park facilities or cash-in-lieu fees are roughly proportional to the demands created by new residential development and contribute to the cost of acquisition and/or improvement of new or existing facilities. 
2.  Applicability and exemptions.

a.  Land dedication or cash-in-lieu required. The owner/developer of land to which this section applies shall, at the option of the city, either: 
i.  Convey to the city in fee simple no less than seven and one-half (7.5) acres per one thousand (1,000) people based on the projected population for the development and determined in accordance with this subsection; or 
ii.  Pay to the city a sum of money based on a per acre fee adopted by resolution of the city council. A cash-in-lieu fee schedule shall be established with consideration for the per acre costs of acquiring and improving park land. 
b.  Population density standards. For the purpose of determining park land dedication requirements, the projected population of a residential development or subdivision shall be based on the following density factors: 
i.  Residential development: citywide average household size. 
(a)  This density factor shall be based on city housing and population data, expressed as a number of persons per dwelling unit, as established by the community development director on an annual basis and published in the manner provided for publication of ordinances under the Wheat Ridge Home Rule Charter. 
ii.  Housing within a designated urban renewal area: 1.7 persons per dwelling unit. 
iii.  Housing within a mixed use development: 1.7 persons per dwelling unit. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, mixed use shall mean the development of a parcel or parcels that includes residential and non-residential primary uses on the same site. 
iv.  Housing within one-half (1/2) mile of a transit station: 1.7 persons per dwelling unit. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, a transit station shall mean the property of any RTD Gold Line commuter rail station, RTD Park-n-Ride, or RTD Transfer Station. 
v.  Housing for seniors: 1.5 persons per dwelling unit. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, senior housing shall be limited to a development qualifying as intended for, and qualifying as, "housing for older persons" pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 3607(b)(2), as amended). In the event that a development intended for "housing for older persons" fails to qualify for such status under the applicable provisions of the Fair Housing Act or pertinent regulations, or having achieved such status thereafter relinquishes or otherwise fails to maintain such status, additional land dedication or cash-in-lieu payment shall be required, based upon the appropriate density factor set forth in this subsection. 
c.  Calculation. The following formula shall be used to determine the minimum amount of land to be dedicated: 
[ (number of proposed dwelling units) × (density factor) × (7.5 acres) ] ÷ 1000 people 
d.  Form and timing of dedication. If land dedication is acceptable, the site shall be free of all liens and encumbrances and shall be conveyed to the city either on the plat or by warranty deed at the time the plat is recorded, accompanied by a current title commitment showing the property free from liens and encumbrances, in a form approved by the community development director. 
e.  Form and timing of cash-in-lieu payment. Cash-in-lieu payments shall be paid to the city by certified check and deposited in the city account to be used solely for the acquisition, development, or improvement of parks, open space, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and related facilities. For subdivisions, payment shall be made at the time the plat is recorded. For development, payment shall be made prior to building permit issuance. 
5.  Required improvements on and adjacent to park land dedication. The subdivider shall be responsible for the cost of park development and all of the required public improvements for streets adjacent to dedicated parks, as outlined in an improvement agreement per section 26-418. 
6.  Required improvements on existing park land. The city shall be responsible for road construction improvements on or adjacent to existing park land or other publicly-owned property. 
7.  Prior dedications. In the event the land being subdivided has been annexed and as part of the annexation proceedings has been subject to a park land contribution, or a cash payment in lieu thereof, or a dedication for public purposes, then the requirements as herein set forth for land or cash in lieu of land shall be waived. 
B.  Dedications for other public sites. 
1.  Dedication of sites for public use, such as schools and fire stations, shall be delineated on the final plat with appropriate dedicatory statements on the plat. 
2.  At the discretion of the public agency requiring the dedication, cash in lieu of land dedication may be required. The cash-in-lieu fee shall be equivalent to the full market value of the acreage required for park land dedication. Value shall be based on anticipated market value after completion of platting and construction of public improvements. 
(Ord. No. 1547 , § 1, 4-28-14)

a.  Half streets. For streets on the perimeter of a subdivision, the subdivider may be permitted to dedicate sufficient right-of-way to provide an adequate street width for two (2) lanes of traffic in accordance with the city's standards and specifications. In such instances, the subdivider shall be required to construct one-half (1/2) of the street width plus six (6) feet or other design as determined and approved by public works department. If on street parking is desired, more right-of-way will be required. 
b.  Administrative or minor subdivision. Where a partial right-of-way dedication is required as part of an administrative or minor subdivision application, the right-of-way may be dedicated to the city by separate document. On the plat, the right-of-way to be designated shall be labeled as a tract, and a plat note shall indicate that the dedication of the tract will be by separate instrument. An exhibit and deed shall be prepared, signed and sealed by the professional land surveyor of record and submitted to the community development department as part of the application packet. 
B.  Future right-of-way expansion note. 
1.  When a development parcel is adjacent to a public street for which widening is not imminent but is contemplated in adopted plans of the city, county, Denver Regional Council of Governments, and/or the Colorado Department of Transportation, a note shall be placed on the plat identifying the proposed expanded right-of-way line. 
2.  By identifying the proposed expanded right-of-way line, the subdivider acknowledges there may be a future reduction in the usable area of the site in connection with a future roadway widening. Buildings are strongly discouraged within this area.

(Ord. No. 1580 , § 2, 8-24-15) 
Secs. 26-421-26-500. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 26-501. - Off-street parking and loading. 
    In all zoning districts, off-street parking facilities for the parking or storage of self-propelled motor vehicles and/or licensed trailers for the use of occupants, employees and patrons of the buildings, structures or premises hereafter erected, altered, used or extended after the effective date of this chapter shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed, unless otherwise specifically provided. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of these parking and loading regulations is to: 
1.  Allow flexibility in addressing vehicle parking, loading, and access issues; 
2.  Present a menu of strategies to solve parking issues for varying site constraints and conditions throughout the city; 
3.  Ensure that off-street parking, loading, and access demands associated with development are met without adversely affecting other nearby land uses and surrounding neighborhoods; 
4.  Lessen congestion upon the public streets in the city; 
5.  Accommodate and encourage multi-modal transportation usage; and 
6.  Reduce the visual impact of parking and loading areas from sidewalks, streets, and adjacent residential properties. 
B.  Applicability. This section shall apply only to new development, major change of uses (e.g., single-family to office; office to restaurant) or substantial extension or expansion of uses or structures for which a building permit or site use approval is required, established subsequent to the adoption of this provision, provided, however, in residential districts on and after August 31, 2009, it shall be unlawful to park motor vehicles in areas meeting the definition of landscaping as defined in section 26-502, on uncontrolled weeds, or on compacted dirt surfaces, unless such surfaces constitute a residential driveway or hard surfaced auxiliary storage area and said driveways or storage areas existed prior to August 31, 2009. 
1.  Applicability to existing uses. 
a.  No existing use or structure shall be deemed nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking (including bicycle parking) or loading requirements prescribed in this section. 
b.  Off-street parking and loading facilities existing on the effective date of this section: September 28, 2009, shall be maintained as long as the use or structure exists, unless an equivalent number of spaces are provided conforming to the requirements of this section. 
c.  In connection with an existing use, this section shall not require the maintenance of more parking or loading spaces than is required for a new building or use under this section. 
d.  For the purposes of this section, "maintained" shall mean that no off-street parking and loading facility shall be reduced in capacity, design, or function to less than the minimum standards prescribed in this section. 
2.  Expansions and increases in intensity. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this section, the off-street parking and loading standards of this section apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged, through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees, or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking and loading requirements. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. Table 1 below sets forth an example for applying this standard: 
TABLE 1: Example of Number of Required Parking Spaces for Expansion or Increase in Intensity 
3,000 square foot office building expansion to 5,000 square feet Existing Building Proposed Building Required Parking (1 space/300 square feet) = 10 spaces required (1 space/300 square feet for new development) = 17 spaces required 7 additional spaces required = 17 total spaces required NOTE: If the existing number of parking spaces is less than the required amount under the current code for new development, this number is used to calculate the proportionate increase required. For example, if there were only 5 existing spaces, then 12 total spaces would be required (5 + 7 additional spaces required with expansion).  
3.  Major change of use. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this section, off-street parking (including bicycle parking) and loading facilities shall be provided for any change of use or manner of operation that would, based on the off-street parking schedule or the off-street loading schedule, result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the former use. Additional parking or loading spaces shall be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use and only for seventy-five (75) percent of the additional parking required by the change in use. Table 2 below sets forth an example for applying this standard: 
TABLE 2: Example of Number of Required Parking Spaces for Major Change of Use 
3,000 square foot office building conversion to restaurant Existing Office Use Proposed Restaurant Use Required Parking Existing Parking: (1 space/300 square feet) = 10 spaces Required Parking for New Development: (1 space/75 square feet) = 40 spaces Proportionate increase in parking = 30 additional spaces from existing * 75% = 22.5 (23) 23 total spaces required NOTE: If the existing number of parking spaces is less than the required amount under the current code for new development, this number is used to calculate the proportionate increase required. For example, if there were only 5 existing spaces, then 28 total spaces would be required.  
4.  Planned developments. In planned developments, the amount of off-street parking shall be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the city's consideration of the planned development application. However, the decision-making body may use the off-street parking and loading requirements of this section as the starting point for determination of the applicable minimum standards. All planned development applications shall include a parking plan according to this section. 
5.  Applicability of parking lot design standards to existing uses. Parking lot design standards shall apply to existing uses as follows: 
Table 3: Parking Lot Design Standards for Expansions of Existing Development or Major Change of Use Required Increase in Parking* Additional Parking Design Standards Less than 25 percent Only the following design standards must be met for any new parking areas: 
  
 Surfacing; 
 Handicapped accessible parking; 
 Sight distance triangle requirements; 
 Usable parking spaces; marking of spaces; 
 Truck-tractor/semi-trailer parking; 
 Parking space and aisle dimensions; 
 Use and maintenance of parking areas; and 
 Small car parking may be designated. Between 25 and 50 percent The new parking areas must meet all design standards of subsection E. of this section. More than 50 percent All parking areas must meet all design standards of subsection E. of this section. * As a percent of the existing number of parking spaces  
6.  Additions affecting existing parking. Nothing in this section shall prevent extension of, or addition to, a building, structure or use into an existing parking area provided the same amount of parking spaces taken by the extension or addition is provided by an enlargement of the existing parking area, or if additional parking is found elsewhere in accordance with these regulations herein, and provided the total number of spaces required for all uses on the lot are met. 
7.  Parking plan required. All plans for the construction of any parking facility, excluding those for single and two-family dwellings, must be approved by the director of community development or his designee and a miscellaneous building permit issued before construction is started. No such land shall be used for parking until approved by the director. The plan must contain the following minimum information: 
a.  Number, location and size of parking stalls. 
b.  Widths of aisles and islands. 
c.  Location of landscaping areas and type of landscaping, including size, species, and number as required in subsection E.6 below. 
d.  Type of surfacing. 
e.  Scale and north arrow. 
f.  Location of streets, curb cuts and property boundaries. 
g.  Traffic directional arrows, signage and markings. 
h.  Loading areas. 
i.  Drainage provisions. 
j.  Location and direction of proposed lighting. 
k.  Location, height, and type of walls or fences to be constructed. 
C.  Shared parking. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of these shared parking regulations is to provide the option for users near one another that have different peak parking demands or different operating hours to share off-street parking facilities to: 
a.  Encourage the efficient use of land and resources; 
b.  Reduce development costs while not adversely affecting traffic patterns and creating minimal spillover parking; 
c.  Allow more complimentary forms of development; and 
d.  Help reduce the amount of land devoted to parking while providing a sufficient number of spaces. 
2.  Shared parking standards. 
a.  Calculation. The number of shared parking spaces for two (2) or more distinguishable land uses shall be determined by using the following procedure: 
i.  Step 1: Calculate the number of parking spaces required for each individual land use as set forth in Table 6 (Schedule of Off-Street Parking). 
ii.  Step 2: Multiply the required number of parking spaces from Step 1 by the percentages in each of the six (6) time periods in Table 4 below. 
iii.  Step 3: For each time period, add the number of spaces required for all applicable land uses to obtain a total for each of the six (6) time periods. 
iv.  Step 4: Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement and use that the total as the shared parking allowance.

b.  Shared parking procedure. 
i.  Mixed occupancy on single parcel or building. In the case of mixed uses on a single parcel or within a single building, the community development director may approve a shared use of parking in accordance with Table 4 above, (Shared Parking Matrix). 
ii.  Off lot shared parking. 
a)  Shared parking agreement. In the case of off lot shared parking where the off lot site is owned by others, a written agreement between the city, the owner who shall provide the additional parking, and the owner of the property seeking the parking shall be entered into. Said agreement shall be recorded as a deed restriction and shall specify the number and location of the parking spaces. Approval of said agreement by the city shall consider the impact of the parking on adjacent or nearby residential properties. Said agreement may be terminated only if adequate onsite or offsite parking space is provided through other means as approved by the director of community development. The agreement shall be recorded with the Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder's Office and shall be enforced until all three (3) parties sign a release. 
b)  Location of off lot shared parking. Off-lot parking may be used provided said parking area is within three hundred (300) feet of the nearest point on the structure or use for which the parking is intended to serve and the off-lot parking is a permitted use as listed in the Table of Uses for the zone district in which the off-lot parking will be located. 
c)  Off lot shared parking pedestrian access. All parking spaces for any off lot shared parking shall have direct pedestrian access to the main entry of the building or use they are intended to serve as determined by the community development director. Shared parking that is located across an arterial street as defined in the Comprehensive Plan shall be accessible to pedestrians using an existing traffic signal which includes a pedestrian crossing phase to cross the arterial street. The total walking distance from the main entry of the building to the shared parking, by way of the traffic signal crossing of the street, shall not exceed three hundred (300) feet. 
d)  Miscellaneous shared parking provisions . The total requirements for off-street parking facilities may be utilized as the sum of the requirements for each of the various uses computed separately. 
i)  Off-street parking facilities for one (1) use shall not be construed as providing required parking for any other use except as provided for under planned developments, or under a shared parking arrangement as approved by the community development director in accordance with this subsection. 
ii)  In no instance may required handicapped accessible parking spaces be provided off lot as part of a shared parking agreement. 
iii)  In no instance may on-street parking be utilized as part of a shared parking agreement. 
D.  Parking reductions. 
1.  Parking reductions by right. The community development director may grant a parking reduction not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the required number of vehicular parking spaces as set forth below without a variance process. Only one (1) of the following options may be applied to any one (1) development: 
TABLE 5: PARKING REDUCTIONS 

Only one of the following may be utilized per development Standard Reduction Allowed Bicycle parking 1 vehicular space for every 2 bicycle parking spaces beyond what is mandatory per Section 26-501.E.4. up to a maximum of a 10% total reduction in vehicular parking spaces. Property located within 1/4 mile of a transit station 25% Property located within 500 feet of a transit bus stop with 20 minute peak service 10% No parking areas located between any part of the building and the public right-of-way 10% Surfacing 10% when an existing parking area with an unimproved surface is improved to comply with Section 26-501.E.12. Structured Parking 10% Motorcycle and Scooter Parking 1 vehicular space for every 2 motorcycle and/or scooter spaces.  
2.  Parking reduction criteria. Parking reductions may only be granted by the community development director upon finding that the proposed reduction: 
a.  Will create minimal spillover parking onto adjacent property or public rights-of-way; 
b.  Will not adversely affect traffic circulation patterns on or off site; and 
c.  Will promote quality urban design equally or better than a plan that strictly complies with the standards in this section. 
The community development director may require a traffic generation study prepared by a professional engineer in order to determine that the criteria in above have been met. 
3.  Parking reductions-Variance procedures. The community development director may grant a parking reduction of up to fifty (50) percent of the required number of vehicular parking spaces in accordance with the variance procedures in subsection 26-115.C of this Code. Parking reductions exceeding fifty (50) percent shall be taken to the board of adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 26-115.C.3 of this Code. 
E.  Standards. 
1.  General provisions. 
a.  Planned development (PRD, PCD, PID, PHD). In planned developments, except for unified shopping centers over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of floor area provided for below, parking shall be considered with regard to the standards set forth in this section for the various use requirements. Where it is desired to share the parking spaces between two (2) or more uses, the regulations set forth in subsection 26-501.C (Shared parking) shall be used to determine the appropriate shared parking arrangements. 
b.  Mixed occupancy and collective parking. In the case of mixed uses on a single parcel or within a single building, or of collective parking for several buildings or uses on two (2) or more parcels, except for shopping centers over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for each of the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one (1) use shall not be construed as providing required parking for any other use except as provided for under planned developments. Unified shopping centers with over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of total combined floor area, which may be either in a single structure or several structures within a single unified development, and which may include various kinds of uses, shall be required to provide a minimum parking ratio of four (4) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of total combined gross leasable floor area unless a shared parking arrangement may be made in accordance with subsection 26-501.C (Shared parking). 
c.  Location of parking areas. 
i.  Off-street parking facilities for any use shall be provided and located on the same lot as the use or uses they are intended to serve except as provided for herein. 
ii.  If sufficient parking spaces cannot be accommodated on the lot for any use, off-lot parking may be used in accordance with subsection 26-501.C (Shared parking). 
iii.  Additional requirements for location of parking requirements may exist in the adopted Architectural and Site Design Manual. 
iv.  Multifamily parking lots. Parking for multifamily development shall not be placed within the minimum front yard setback. Where parking is to be placed within a side or rear yard which is adjacent to a public street, a landscape buffer of at least ten (10) feet is required.

iii.  Vehicular parking space reductions for bicycle parking spaces. The number of required motor vehicle parking spaces may be reduced at the ratio of one (1) motor vehicle parking space for each two (2) bicycle parking spaces, up to a maximum reduction of ten (10) percent of the required motor vehicle parking spaces in accordance with Table 7 above. 
5.  Surfacing. For all uses other than single-family dwellings in agricultural zone districts, areas subject to wheeled traffic for access, parking, sales or storage, shall be properly graded for drainage. These areas shall be surfaced with concrete, asphalt or brick pavers. For one- or two-family dwellings, the first twenty-five (25) feet of driveway area from the existing edge of pavement into the site shall be surfaced with concrete, asphalt, brick pavers or similar materials. The auxiliary storage of motorized or non-motorized vehicles cannot occur within six (6) feet of the front property line. The storage area must be hard surfaced and must be built so that the materials used as to the parking surface stays contained within the parking pad (with the use of concrete curbs, railroad ties, etc). 
6.  Parking area landscaping. Parking area landscaping shall be provided as set forth below. Landscaping in off street parking areas shall be counted towards the minimum total landscaped area required by section 26-502. 
a.  Landscape buffering for parking and loading areas. 
i.  Adjacent to low- or medium-density residential. Whenever a parking lot or loading area boundary adjoins property zoned for low- or medium-density residential use, or if zoned agricultural but developed as residential, a landscape buffer of six (6) feet from said lot boundary shall be required. Within the six-foot landscape buffer, a six-foot-high view-obscuring fence, decorative wall or landscaped hedge with a natural height of six (6) feet shall be provided. In addition, grass or other acceptable groundcover or trees and/or shrubs shall be planted within the landscape buffer areas as approved by the director of community development through a landscape plan. 
ii.  Between public right-of-way and structure(s). When a parking lot or loading area is placed between the public right-of-way and the structure(s), a screening of the parking area shall be established between the right-of-way and the parking area. This view-obscuring screen shall be composed of live plantings, berms, fences or walls, or a combination thereof. The height of the screening shall be subject to the sight distance triangle requirements. See section 26-603. Also see subsection 26-502.D.3.c.2 regarding landscape buffers on nonresidential property. 
b.  Landscaped islands in parking areas. The intent of the requirements for landscaped islands in larger parking areas is to break up groups of parking spaces within the parking area to minimize the aesthetic impacts of large, uninterrupted parking areas. 
i.  All parking areas in excess of thirty (30) spaces shall have at least one (1) interior landscaped island per thirty (30) spaces. Each such landscaped island shall occupy the equivalent of one (1) parking space (minimum) and each such required island shall be landscaped with a minimum of one (1) two-inch caliper tree or larger and four (4) shrubs or accepted groundcover. 
ii.  At the discretion of the owner, and with approval of the director of community development, based upon the intent and purpose of this section, an acceptable alternative to individual islands would be the equivalent aggregate landscaped area developed in larger islands or as interior divider strips. 
iii.  Parking lot islands shall be irrigated with an automated sprinkler and have raised concrete curbs. 
iv.  No landscaping within landscaped islands may obstruct visibility for vehicles entering, maneuvering in, or exiting the parking lot.

Where possible, loading docks must be located on the site so as not to be viewed from major roads, access ways, or residentially zoned property. 
b.  The typical dimensions of an off-street loading space are twelve (12) feet wide by forty (40) feet long, with a minimum vertical clearance of fourteen (14) feet. A minimum maneuvering aisle width of forty (40) feet shall be provided behind the off-street loading space. These dimensions may be altered by the public works director based on the specific needs of the business and anticipated volumes of use. 
c.  No loading space shall be located in any front setback area, nor shall it permit any vehicle to extend into any front setback area or across any lot line of a more restrictive district while being loaded or unloaded. 
d.  In no instance shall a passenger loading area be considered an off-street loading area for the purposes of this subsection. 
9.  Handicapped parking. For all uses other than one- and two-family dwellings, parking shall be provided for the handicapped at the minimum rate consistent with the following table. The minimum width of an accessible parking space shall be eight and one-half (81/2) feet with an adjacent accessible aisle with a minimum width of five (5) feet.

The following diagram illustrates typical parking stall layout for full-sized and compact cars in accordance with the above standards: 
12.  Miscellaneous. 
a.  Auxiliary storage of vehicles. The auxiliary storage of motorized or non-motorized vehicles cannot occur within six (6) feet of the front property line. The storage area must be hard surfaced and must be built so that the material used as to the parking surface stays contained within the parking pad (with the use of concrete curbs, railroad ties, etc). 
b.  Usable parking spaces. Any parking stall which is unusable due to maneuverability difficulties or does not have clear access into and out of its parking space shall not be considered in the count of the total number of available parking spaces on the property. Double-loaded spaces (parking where one (1) vehicle blocks another) are considered unusable, except when serving one and two-family dwellings. 
c.  Back-out parking. Except for one- and two-family dwellings, all parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles exiting from the parking area will not be required to back out across any public sidewalk or public right-of-way, unless an exception has been granted by the director of public works. 
d.  One-way traffic flow. Parking which is designed for one-way traffic shall be clearly indicated as such by the use of a sign or arrow designating the direction of traffic flow and by the words "one-way." 
e.  Marking of parking spaces. Parking spaces shall be marked and maintained on the pavement and any other directional markings/signs shall be installed as required by the city to ensure the approved use of space, direction of traffic flow and general safety in accordance with the approved parking plan. 
f.  Parking lot design standards for truck-tractors and/or semi-trailers. Where it is desired to park truck-tractors and/or semi-trailers as regulated by sections 26-618 and 26-619, a parking plan shall be submitted which shows the location, extent and size of the proposed truck-tractor and semi-trailer parking, and which indicates proposed screening, lighting, landscaping, circulation, type of paving, and any other feature which will help the planning commission, city council and staff to evaluate the proposal and potential impacts. The following minimum standards shall be used in designing such parking lots: 
Dimensions: 
TABLE 11: Truck-tractors/semi-trailers Feet (1) Tractor only:  Length 25  Width 12  Aisle width 28 (2) Trailer only:  Length 40  Width 12  Aisle width 40 (3) Combo tractor and trailer:  Length 70  Width 12  Aisle Width 40

iv.  The use of standard automobile parking spaces and/or circulation aisles for truck-tractor and/or semi-trailer parking or circulation is prohibited. 
g.  Fractions. When units of measurements determining number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall require one (1) parking space. 
h.  Small car parking. In parking lots with thirty (30) spaces or more, twenty (20) percent of the required parking spaces may be designated for small or compact cars; provided, that small car parking area or spaces shall be clearly labeled or otherwise distinguished from full-sized parking areas or spaces. 
i.  Bumper, curb and wheel stops. To ensure the proper maintenance of these facilities, parking areas shall be designed so that a parked vehicle does not overhang the public right-of-way, public sidewalk, or adjacent property. A permanent curb, bumper, wheel stop or similar device shall be installed which shall be adequate to protect the right-of-way, sidewalk, or adjacent property from vehicular overhang and to protect any structure from vehicular damage. If such protection is provided by means of a method designed to stop the wheel rather than the bumper of the vehicle, the stopping edge shall be placed no closer than two (2) feet from the edges of the public right-of-way, sidewalk or building. A parked vehicle may overhang a landscape area up to two (2) feet. Such landscaped area must be low maintenance and may be included as a part of the length of the parking stall. 
j.  Restrictions on the use of nonresidential parking areas. No parking area shall be used for the sale, storage, repair of, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. This shall not apply to vehicles on sales lots and does not preclude emergency repairs to a motor vehicle. For automotive repair facilities, vehicles stored on the property in excess of seventy-two (72) hours for the purpose of being repaired must be screened from view from adjacent streets and properties by a six-foot-high solid fence. 
k.  Multifamily parking lots. Parking for multifamily development shall not be placed within the minimum front yard setback. Where parking is to be placed within a side or rear yard, which is adjacent to a public street, a landscape buffer of at least ten (10) feet is required. 
l.  Use and maintenance of parking area. For all uses, including one- and two-family dwelling uses, parking of vehicles shall be limited to those areas specifically developed for parking and shall not be permitted within landscaped areas, designated fire lanes, loading zones, or other areas not designed and developed for parking. All parking and drive areas shall be maintained so as to prevent unsafe, muddy, dusty, weedy, or unsightly or blighting conditions. The provisions of these subsections l. and m. shall apply to both existing and future conditions. 
m.  Appeal/variances and waivers to standards. Variances and waivers to parking requirements shall be processed as a variance pursuant to section 26-115, unless otherwise specified in this section. 
F.  Vehicular access. Vehicular access to any property shall be controlled in such a manner as to protect the traffic-carrying capacity of the street upon which the property abuts, as well as to protect the value of the adjacent property. 
1.  Driveway connections to street. For one- or two-family dwellings, the first twenty-five (25) feet of driveway area from the existing edge of pavement into the site shall be surfaced with concrete, asphalt, brick pavers, or similar materials. For all uses, driveway connections with the public street must be paved between the property line and the existing edge of asphalt of the street. 
2.  Spacing of vehicle access. 
a.  For all uses other than one- and two-family dwellings, no vehicle entrances or exits may be closer than twenty-five (25) feet to any property line except when used for joint access for two (2) or more lots. 
b.  For all uses other than one- and two-family dwellings, vehicle entrances or exits on the same lot shall be spaced at not less than one-hundred-foot intervals. The one-hundred-foot spacing shall be measured from the interior edge of both access points. 
c.  For all uses, corner lots shall have no vehicular entrances or exits located closer than twenty-five (25) feet from any two (2) intersecting street rights-of-way, except on arterial or major collector streets such distance shall be fifty (50) feet. 
d.  The public works director may approve a modification or waiver to the vehicle access standards and requirements stated in this subsection 2. based upon consideration of traffic characteristics, both on and off of the site, with the primary purpose of preserving public safety. 
3.  Curb cut widths. 
a.  Residential zone districts. In all residential districts, curb cuts for property access shall be not less than ten (10) feet and not more than twenty-four (24) feet in width. 
b.  Commercial and industrial zone districts. Curb cuts in commercial and industrial districts shall not be more than thirty-five (35) feet in width when serving an individual property and shall not in any instance be less than twenty (20) feet. 
c.  Joint curb cuts. A joint curb cut, one (1) which serves more than one (1) property, may not exceed forty-five (45) feet in width. 
d.  [ Modification or waiver. ] The public works director may approve a modification or waiver to the vehicle access standards and requirements stated in this subsection 3. based upon consideration of traffic characteristics, both on and off of the site, with the primary purpose of preserving public safety. 
4.  Number of access points. 
a.  For all uses, one (1) access point per property ownership will be permitted, unless a site plan or traffic study approved by the city shows that additional access points are required to adequately handle driveway volumes and will not be detrimental to traffic flow on adjacent public streets. 
b.  In cases where it is possible to provide one (1) access point which will serve adjacent properties or where adherence to these requirements would leave a parcel of property without vehicular access, curb cut setback or spacing requirements may be reduced or enlarged so as to permit a single vehicular access point if approved by the public works director. 
c.  Low-density residential uses are permitted to have "horseshoe-shaped" driveways provided that the public street accesses are thirty (30) feet apart at the closest point (interior edges). 
d.  The public works director may approve a modification to or waiver to the vehicle access standards and requirements stated in this subsection 4., based upon consideration of traffic characteristics, both on and off of the site, with the primary purpose of preserving public safety. 
G.  Residential parking. 
1.  Parking of commercial vehicles. In residential zone districts, the parking of trucks, vans, buses or licensed trailers which are used for commercial purposes, whether the commercial enterprise is conducted from the home or conducted elsewhere, is prohibited except as permitted by this section. An occupant of a dwelling may park, or allow the parking of, no more than one (1) truck or van which is used for commercial purposes upon the premises or confined to the street frontage of the lot in question; provided, however, that such vehicle does not exceed a one-ton chassis. Parking of trailers which are used for commercial purposes is prohibited on any public right-of-way. 
2.  Parking of recreational vehicles and trailers. 
a.  Maximum number allowed. In residential zone districts, a maximum of two (2) of any the following vehicles may be parked outside upon property owned or rented by the vehicle owner, provided the vehicle owner resides on the property: 
i.  Recreational vehicle. 
ii.  Trailer upon which are stored personal recreational vehicles. 
b.  Exemptions from maximum number allowed. Recreational vehicles or trailers are exempt from this two-vehicle limitation provided the vehicles or trailers are stored in the area between the side property line and the side wall of the structure and the back property line and the back wall of the structure, provided both of the following are met: 
i.  The vehicles or trailers are less than six (6) feet in height; and 
ii.  The vehicles or trailers are not visible from the public right-of-way as a result of being stored behind a solid fence six (6) feet in height, a structure, or vegetation which completely screens the vehicle from view from the public right-of-way. 
In determining if a trailer is exempt or not exempt from the provisions of this subsection B., the height of the trailer will depend upon whether the trailer is loaded or not. A trailer that is exempt in an unloaded condition shall not be considered exempt in a loaded condition if the trailer plus load exceeds six (6) feet in height. 
3.  Location of recreational vehicles and trailers. 
a.  Restrictions adjacent to streets. Only one (1) such recreational vehicle or trailer may be stored in the area between the street and all walls of the structure facing the street. Such vehicles or trailers must be parked six (6) feet or more inside the front property line. For corner lots, the one (1) vehicle restriction shall apply to both areas between the street and the walls of the structure facing the street. Any vehicle or trailer lying partially between the street and the front walls of the structure shall be considered to be parked or stored in the front yard. Where it is difficult to determine the public right-of-way boundary due to lack of curb, gutter and/or sidewalk, or survey markers, such boundaries shall be presumed to be ten (10) feet from the edge of pavement or back of curb. Where a sidewalk exists, such boundaries shall be presumed to be two (2) feet from the outside edge of sidewalk. For the purposes of this subsection 3.a, permanent or temporary carports, frame covered structures, tents, or other temporary structures shall not be used to store or conceal such recreational vehicles or trailers in excess of the maximum number permitted. 
b.  Side and rear setbacks. Recreational vehicles or trailers stored in a side yard need not meet any setback requirements. Recreational vehicles or trailers exceeding six (6) feet in height stored in a back yard must meet the side and rear yard setback requirements for accessory structures for the zone district in which the recreational vehicle or trailer is stored. Recreational vehicles and trailers less than six (6) feet in height stored in a back yard do not need to meet rear and side yard setbacks. 
c.  Parking in rights-of-way. 
i.  In residential zone districts, detached trailers and recreational vehicles are prohibited from parking in public rights-of-way; however one (1) recreational vehicle or one (1) trailer may be parked within public street rights-of-way for a period up to seventy-two (72) hours, provided they are attached to the towing vehicle. Moving the towing vehicle and/or the trailer to another location in the right-of-way does not extend or restart the seventy-two-hour period. 
ii.  In residential zone districts, where it is desired to maintain such a restricted vehicle either within six (6) feet of a public street on private property or within a lawful parking area on a public street abutting the front of the property in excess of seventy-two (72) hours, the property owner may obtain a temporary parking permit from the community development department. Such temporary parking permit shall be for a time period not to exceed fourteen (14) days and no more than one (1) such permit shall be issued each six (6) months for the same vehicle. The issuance of a temporary permit is for the purpose of parking only and not for any other activity. The permit must be placed upon the inside windshield or side window on the driver's side so as to be visible for inspection. 
d.  Miscellaneous recreational vehicle and trailer regulations.

ARTICLE VI. - SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS 

Sec. 26-601. - Scope and application. 
    This article applies generally to all site development throughout the various zone districts within the city. This article is in addition to any regulation, standard or requirement specifically set forth in any other section of this chapter or any other section of the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-602. - Maintenance of structures and sites. 
    All structures, and all elements and features of any site (including, without limitation, buildings, fences, walls, parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, signs, landscaping, utility lines and irrigation systems) for which the owner thereof or his or her predecessor-in-interest obtained approval from the city for the construction or establishment, shall be maintained in good repair and in substantially the form, condition and nature which was represented at the time they were constructed. It is the intention of this section that such structures, elements and features of sites, having once been approved for construction or development, shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a condition which is in any respect inferior to the condition or state upon which the original approval for construction or development was based. Maintenance procedures and requirements applicable to the Streetscape and Architectural Design Overlay Districts are found in the Maintenance Standards section of the Streetscape and Architectural Design Manual. For purposes of this section, either or both the owner or tenant of the structure or real property shall be considered the responsible party. The city, after notice to the property owner, may enter upon the property and correct the condition in the event the owner or tenant fails to do so. The cost of such correction may be assessed against the property and collected by the city in any manner permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-603. - Fences, walls, and obstructions to view. 
    Divisional fences and divisional walls are permitted in any zone district with the issuance of a fence permit approved by the community development department in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
A.  Permitted fence, etc., heights. Generally, no divisional fence, wall or hedge above the height of forty-eight (48) inches shall be permitted within a minimum required front yard, or above the height of six (6) feet in instances not otherwise specified. Decorative, open-type fences which are at least eighty (80) percent open, such as wrought iron fence, may be permitted up to six (6) feet in height above the elevation of the street within minimum front yards. Woven-wire and chainlink fences are prohibited above forty-eight (48) inches in front yards. 
B.  Sight distance triangle requirement. Where property abuts the intersection of two (2) streets; the intersection of an alley and a street; or the intersection of a driveway and a street, unobstructed view shall be provided and maintained at all times within the sight distance triangle and clear zone as described in this subsection. 
1.  Sight distance triangle. The sight distance triangle is the horizontal area at the intersection of two (2) streets; a street and an alley; or a street and a driveway. Two (2) sides of the triangle are measured from the corner intersection along the curb and gutter flow line, or if no curb exists, from the edge of pavement, for a distance specified below: 
a.  Streets, collector or arterial: Fifty-five (55) feet. 
b.  Streets, local or private: Twenty-five (25) feet. 
c.  Alleys: Fifteen (15) feet. 
d.  Driveways: Fifteen (15) feet. 
The third side of the triangle is a line across the corner joining the other two (2) sides. Where an intersection has rounded corners, the sides will be extended in a straight line to a point of intersection, as shown in Figure 26-603.1. 

Figure 26-603.1 - Sight Distance Triangle
  
2.  Vertical clear zone. The vertical clear zone is the area above a sight distance triangle in which obstructions shall be minimized to provide a clear view. 
a.  Height. The clear zone is measured vertically from the curb and gutter flow line, or if no curb exists, from the edge of pavement. If the intersection includes a collector or arterial street, the clear zone is the area between a height of thirty-six (36) and ninety-six (96) inches. For all other intersections, the clear zone is between forty-two (42) and ninety-six (96) inches. See Figure 26-603.2. 
b.  Obstructions prohibited. The clear zone shall be free of obstructions, including but not limited to fences, walls, landscaping, signs, structures, tree canopies or parked vehicles. 
c.  Exceptions. Certain obstructions may be approved by the director of public works (or his/her designee) to be located within the clear zone. These may include: 
i.  Approved decorative open type fences that are at least eighty (80) percent open; 
ii.  Approved landscaping, such as street trees; 
iii.  Approved signs, such as pole signs with a diameter of less than twelve (12) inches; 
iv.  Public utility poles; 
v.  Obstructions in the driveway sight triangle for single and two family homes on local streets. 

Figure 26-603.2 - Clear Zone
  
3.  Signalized intersections. At signalized intersections, where both streets are either collectors and/or arterials, the required sight distances shall be governed by the standards set forth in the most current edition of the policy on geometric design of highways and streets, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
4.  Authority of the director of public works. For other signalized intersections involving local streets, the director of public works (or his/her designee) is authorized to permit modifications to the sight triangle requirements for special circumstances in accordance with the standards set forth in the most current edition of the policy on geometric design of highways and streets, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
For corner lots bounded by public streets or private drives with vertical curves and where the application of the standard sight triangle regulations does not provide adequate sight clearance to protect the public safety, the director of public works (or his/her designee) shall determine the necessary vertical height clearance and the sight triangle dimensions in order to ensure a safe sight distance. 
C.  Columns, poles and posts. Support columns, poles or posts shall be permitted to be constructed up to one (1) foot higher than the permitted fence heights; however, the columns, poles or posts cannot be constructed in such a manner as to constitute a traffic hazard due to obstruction of view. No such column, pole or post which extends above the maximum fence height shall be permitted to be constructed greater than two (2) feet by two (2) feet and no less than ten (10) feet on center. Column caps may be no larger than two and one-half (21/2) feet by two and one-half (21/2) feet. 
D.  Fences and divisional walls permitted. 
1.  Masonry walls. 
2.  Ornamental iron.

b.  Barbed wire shall be permitted in commercial, industrial and public facilities (PF) zone districts where placed on top of a six-foot-high fence or higher where permitted. Barbed wire placed on top of a fence shall not be counted toward the height of a fence. The barbed wire placed on top of a fence shall not be greater than two (2) feet in height and shall point inwards towards the property. In the public facilities zone district, where barbed wire fencing is used next to existing residential development, consideration shall be given to minimize the impact through buffering. 
E.  Fence types prohibited. 
1.  Any fence, if in the opinion of the chief building inspector, public works director, or chief of police, that would constitute a hazard to the health or safety of any person; and 
2.  Any fence which does not comply with the provisions hereof, unless a variance has been approved. 
F.  Planned developments. Fences and divisional walls within a planned development may vary from these standards; provided that the fences are in conformance with the provisions set forth for fencing and walls as approved in the outline development plan and as detailed on an approved specific development plan.

B.  Allowed setback encroachments for principal buildings. The following setback reduction shall apply to front yards and to side or rear yards which abut a public street. If fifty (50) percent or more of the main buildings within a built-up area in any district have less than the required setback, each new main building may have a setback consistent with the average building setbacks in the immediate area. For the purpose of computing such average, a setback less than fifteen (15) feet shall be deemed to be fifteen (15) feet. 
    For the purpose of front yard setbacks, an immediate area shall be deemed "built-up" if fifty (50) percent or more of the lots within the same block and within two hundred (200) feet on each side lot line within the same block of any particular lot have been improved with buildings (see figure 26-611.1). For the purpose of side or rear yard setbacks which abut a public street, an immediate area shall be deemed "built-up" if fifty (50) percent or more of the lots on the same side of the street and within three hundred (300 feet) of the subject parcel have been improved with buildings. However, in no instance shall a structure encroach into a required sight distance triangle.

H.  Board of adjustment authority. Authority is expressly granted to the board of adjustment to hear requests for variances, and to grant variances from the provisions of this section. 
I.  Exemption of cable television franchisee. It is the expressed intent of the city council that the provisions of this section shall not apply to AT&T Broadband or any successor, additional franchisee or permittee under chapter 23 of the Code of Laws of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
J.  Statement of purpose. The city council of the City of Wheat Ridge is cognizant of the provisions of the rule adopted by the Federal Communications Commission as section 25.104 of the commission's rules and regulations. As its response thereto, the city council does hereby declare that the purpose of adopting this section is to protect the aesthetic integrity of the City of Wheat Ridge and the neighborhoods thereof. In adopting said section, the city council has attempted to adopt regulations which provide for such aesthetic protection while placing the least possible restrictions or limitations upon the legitimate ability of residents to avail themselves of the current and future technology represented by satellite signal-receiving earth stations. The city council has knowingly and intentionally provided for restrictions on such aspects of satellite signal-receiving earth stations as color and location and roof mounting because those aspects of regulation relate directly to aesthetic considerations which are important to all residents of the city, not just those who choose to avail themselves of the technology of satellite signal-receiving earth stations, and those aspects of regulations which are deemed not to interfere unreasonably with the right of a homeowner or business owner to avail himself of, and to receive, said technology. In addition, the right of an aggrieved property owner to seek a variance from the provisions of this section provides adequate protection, without unreasonable or excessive cost, of the rights of both the user of the technology and the remaining property owners within the city.

(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-620. - Acceleration/deceleration lanes. 
    In all districts, any use providing access to an expressway, arterial street, collector street or I-70 frontage road may be required to construct and dedicate acceleration and/or deceleration lanes along those streets upon which access is obtained. In addition, "accel/decel" lanes may be required for any street within an area which is covered by an adopted master plan in the Comprehensive Plan. This requirement shall be determined at the time of subdivision site plan approval (for planned developments), rezoning or building permit review. If existing right-of-way is inadequate to accommodate an accel/decel lane, the city shall have the right to require a dedication therefore. 
    The basis for requiring acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be as follows: 
A.  Access to a site is obtained from the particular street which is being evaluated for an accel/decel lane. 
B.  For Colorado State Highways and state-regulated interstate frontage roads, the Colorado Division of Highways Access Code shall apply except where City of Wheat Ridge requirements are more restrictive, in which case, Wheat Ridge regulations shall apply. 
C.  For all other applicable streets, accel/decel lanes may be required upon a finding that: 
1.  There is an increase in vehicular trips to and from a particular site in excess of either twenty (20) percent or one hundred (100) trips per day, whichever is higher; or 
2.  There is an increase in vehicular traffic to and from a particular site in excess of fifteen (15) trips in any one (1) hour; unless a traffic impact study indicates that the level of service is at or above level of service "E" on the fronting street, as defined in the Institute of Traffic Engineers' definition of "level of services"; or 
3.  An accel/decel lane is in existence (or is reserved) upon adjacent property and pedestrian or vehicular traffic would be imperiled, or minimum recognized engineering design and/or safety standards would not be met, if the accel/decel lane was not extended. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-621. - Residential parking. 
A.  In residential zone districts, the parking of trucks, vans, buses or licensed trailers which are used for commercial purposes, whether the commercial enterprise is conducted from the home or conducted elsewhere, is prohibited except as permitted by this section. An occupant of a dwelling may park, or allow the parking of, no more than one (1) truck or van which is used for commercial purposes upon the premises or confined to the street frontage of the lot in question; provided, however, that such vehicle does not exceed a one-ton chassis. Parking of trailers which are used for commercial purposes is prohibited on any public right-of-way. 
B.  In residential zone districts, a maximum of two (2) of any the following vehicles may be parked outside upon property owned or rented by the vehicle owner, provided the vehicle owner resides on the property: 
 Recreational vehicle 
 Trailer upon which are stored personal recreational vehicles 
Recreational vehicles or trailers are exempt from this two-vehicle limitation provided the vehicles or trailers are stored in the area between the side property line and the side wall of the structure and the back property line and the back wall of the structure, provided both of the following are met: 
 The vehicles or trailers are less than six (6) feet in height, and 
 The vehicles or trailers are not visible from the public right-of-way as a result of being stored behind a solid fence six (6) feet in height, a structure, or vegetation which completely screens the vehicle from view from the public right-of-way. 
In determining if a trailer is exempt or not exempt from the provisions of this subsection B, the height of the trailer will depend upon whether the trailer is loaded or not. A trailer that is exempt in an unloaded condition shall not be considered exempt in a loaded condition if the trailer plus load exceeds six (6) feet in height. 
C.  Only one (1) such recreational vehicle or trailer may be stored in the area between the street and all walls of the structure facing the street. Such vehicles or trailers must be parked six (6) feet or more inside the front property line. For corner lots, the one (1) vehicle restriction shall apply to both areas between the street and the walls of the structure facing the street. Any vehicle or trailer lying partially between the street and the front walls of the structure shall be considered to be parked or stored in the front yard. Where it is difficult to determine the public right-of-way boundary due to lack of curb, gutter and/or sidewalk, or survey markers, such boundaries shall be presumed to be ten (10) feet from the edge of pavement or back of curb. Where a sidewalk exists, such boundaries shall be presumed to be two (2) feet from the outside edge of sidewalk. For the purposes of this subsection C, permanent or temporary carports, frame covered structures, tents, or other temporary structures shall not be used to store or conceal such recreational vehicles or trailers in excess of the maximum number permitted. 
D.  Recreational vehicles or trailers stored in a side yard need not meet any setback requirements. Recreational vehicles or trailers exceeding six (6) feet in height stored in a back yard must meet the side and rear yard setback requirements for accessory structures for the zone district in which the recreational vehicle or trailer is stored. Recreational vehicles and trailers less than six (6) feet in height stored in a back yard do not need to meet rear and side yard setbacks. 
E.  In residential zone districts, detached trailers and recreational vehicles are prohibited from parking in public rights-of-way; however one (1) recreational vehicle or one (1) trailer may be parked within public street rights-of-way for a period up to seventy-two (72) hours, provided they are attached to the towing vehicle. Moving the towing vehicle and/or the trailer to another location in the right-of-way does not extend or restart the seventy-two-hour period. 
F.  In residential zone districts, where it is desired to maintain such a restricted vehicle either within six (6) feet of a public street on private property or within a lawful parking area on a public street abutting the front of the property in excess of seventy-two (72) hours, the property owner may obtain a temporary parking permit from the planning and development department. Such temporary parking permit shall be for a time period not to exceed fourteen (14) days and no more than one (1) such permit shall be issued each six (6) months for the same vehicle. The issuance of a temporary permit is for the purpose of parking only and not for any other activity. The permit must be placed upon the inside windshield or side window on the driver's side so as to be visible for inspection. 
G.  Pickup truck-mounted campers, when mounted upon pickup trucks, are not subject to these parking restrictions except that such camper shall not be used for permanent or temporary living quarters. Nothing in this section will be construed to restrict or limit parking of any vehicle so described upon private property so long as said vehicle is parked in accordance with the limitations of this section and provided that sight distance triangle requirements of section 26-603 are met. 
H.  Areas which are used to store or park allowed recreational vehicles or trailers shall be of an improved surface consisting of concrete, asphalt, brick pavers, gravel at least six (6) inches in depth, or similar materials. If gravel is used, the parking or storage area must be built to that the material used for surfacing stays contained with the storage or parking area with the use of concrete curbs, railroad ties, landscape timbers, or similar materials. 
I.  The storage of recreational vehicles or trailers is permitted upon multi-family residential properties where the owner of the vehicle resides upon the premises, and where such vehicle or vehicles do not displace parking spaces required to meet the minimum vehicular parking requirement for the property as set forth herein for multifamily residential land uses. 
J.  Any vehicle or trailer owner may apply for a variance to the restrictions contained in subsections B, C, and D in accordance with the procedures for requesting a minor variance as provided in subsection 26-115 C 1 of this Code, whether or not the requested variance is within the ten (10) percent limitation. Should objections be received from the adjacent property owners, the community development director shall schedule the request for a public hearing before the board of adjustment according to the noticing procedures contained in subsections 26-109 B, C and D. Requests for variances under this subsection J shall not be charged a fee if the request is filed by December 31, 2004. Any variance granted by either the community development director or the board of adjustment shall be a grant of the variance to the property owner only.

D.  Any police officer or any employee of the city designated to give notices of violations of this section as part of their official duties are hereby empowered to issue an appropriate citation or summons and complaint under this Code. Such persons shall be empowered with a right of reasonable access to and entry upon property within the city for the purposes of monitoring compliance with this section and for the purposes of issuing citations or otherwise enforcing this section. 
E.  The municipal court shall have the jurisdiction to hear and decide all such complaints filed under this section, and, upon conviction, may impose punishment as provided at sections 1-5 and 1-6 of this Code. In any prosecution under this section, proof that the vehicle described in the complaint was parked with a "for sale" sign in a conspicuous place on or in the vehicle shall constitute prima facie evidence that the owner of the vehicle was the person who parked or knowingly permitted to be parked such vehicle for the principal purpose of selling such vehicle, and that such person parked or knowingly permitted the vehicle to be parked at such place and for the time in which such violation occurred. 
F.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to those persons who have been licensed by the City of Wheat Ridge to sell vehicles. This section shall apply as provided in subsection A., above and to all existing property within city limits. 
G.  Vehicles may be parked on property zoned residential for the principal purpose of sale only in compliance with all of the following conditions: 
1.  The vehicle must be parked upon the driveway or upon the street immediately adjacent to the residential property relied upon; 
2.  Only one (1) vehicle at any one (1) time may be parked for the principal purpose of sale, provided that in the event of death in the family, divorce, terminal illness or confinement in a correctional, mental or nursing facility the director of community development may give written authorization that up to three (3) vehicles may be sold at one (1) time; and 
3.  In the event the owner of the vehicle is not the owner of the residential zoned property relied upon for compliance with this section such vehicle owner must obtain the permission of such property owner in writing.

Sec. 26-625. - Accessory buildings and structures. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to allow accessory buildings that are incidental and subordinate to the principal use and structure on a property and to set forth standards that help to minimize adverse impacts of these buildings on adjacent property. The purpose of this section is also to allow flexibility to construct accessory buildings on challenging properties relative to size and existing physical improvements while minimizing adverse impacts on surrounding properties. The terms building and structure are used interchangeably in this section and all regulations herein apply to buildings and structures, irrespective of the term used. 
B.  Applicability. All accessory buildings shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this section, and those in sections 26-205 to 26-220 (zone district regulations). In the event of a conflict between the accessory building standards in this section and any other requirements of this Code, this section shall control. 
C.  Accessory building standards for residential and agricultural zone districts 
1.  General standards. 
a.  Location. 
i.  No accessory building shall be located on a vacant lot devoid of any primary or main building. 
ii.  No accessory building shall be located within any platted or recorded easement or over any utility, except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by the city or utility provider, as applicable. 
b.  Size and height. The size and height of accessory buildings shall be as set forth in the residential and agricultural zone district regulations, as applicable, in sections 26-205 to 26-214. 
c.  Miscellaneous provisions. 
i.  Metal accessory building restriction. Metal accessory buildings over one hundred twenty (120) square feet are not permitted in any residential zoning district.

Vertically placed vinyl-clad siding is not allowed. 
ii.  Buildings housing animals. Any building that houses animals, except a residence, shall be setback a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from property lines and at least thirty (30) feet from a residential structure on an adjacent property, except as otherwise specified in any zone district. 
iii.  Gates and guard houses. Gates and guard houses are only allowed as part of an approved planned development. 
iv.  Dwelling unit restriction. Except as otherwise expressly allowed, no dwelling unit shall be located in any accessory. 
2.  Major and minor accessory buildings. Major and minor accessory buildings shall be as defined in sections 26-205 to 26-214 based on size and height. 
3.  Allowable setback encroachments for accessory buildings. Accessory buildings may encroach into required setbacks as set forth below: 
a.  Front yards and side and rear yards abutting public streets. Where an existing principal building that lawfully existed at the time of the adoption or amendment of this section encroaches into a required front yard setback or a required side or rear yard setback abutting a public street, an accessory building may encroach into the required setback as follows, provided that there shall be no encroachment into the minimum sight distance triangle as set forth in subsection 26-603.B: 
i.  Detached garages and carports. Detached garages and carports may build in line with the nonconforming principal building, as long as the detached garage is located behind the front or street-facing facade of the principal building, except as follows: 

a)  Where the garage door or main vehicular access is located parallel to the street, the setback cannot be between five (5) feet and eighteen (18) feet. The purpose of this regulation is to allow setback encroachments where there will not be the possibility of vehicles parked in the driveway in conflict with public rights-of-way. (See Figure 26-625.1) 
b)  Where the garage door or main vehicular access is located perpendicular to the street, the detached garage or carport may be built in line with the principal building. The purpose of this regulation is to allow setback encroachments where there will not be the possibility of vehicles parked in the driveway in conflict with public rights-of-way. 
c)  Where the garage door or main vehicular access is located parallel to and accessed off of an arterial street, the detached garage may not encroach into the required setback. 
d)  The community development director may require modified setbacks in these instances where there may be potentially hazardous conditions. 
ii.  All other accessory buildings. Accessory buildings that do not have any vehicular access may build in line with the nonconforming principal structure in front yards and side and rear yards abutting public streets, as long as the accessory building is located behind the front or street-facing facade of the principal structure. 
D.  Accessory building standards for commercial and industrial zone districts. 
1.  General standards.

7.  An applicant's failure to meet deadlines or to timely file materials and information necessary to comply with the permit process, as determined by the community development director in his or her sole and absolute discretion, shall result in the rejection of his or her application and the generation of a new notice of vacancy, in accordance with paragraph 2., above.

Sec. 26-801. - Authorization; findings, objectives. 
A.  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Colorado has in C.R.S. § 31-23-301, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, acting pursuant to its powers and authorities granted and reserved in Title 29 of the Colorado Revised Statutes under Article 20 of the Constitution of the State of Colorado and the Home Rule Charter adopted thereunder, does hereby ordain following as its floodplain zoning provisions. 
B.  Findings of fact. The city council hereby finds that: 
1.  The flood hazard areas of Wheat Ridge are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and/or velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas. Flood losses are also caused by uses that are inadequately floodproofed, inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
C.  Public objectives to be achieved. The city council hereby finds it in the public interest, and in the furtherance of the public health, safety and welfare, that the following objectives be fulfilled: 
1.  To promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to minimize flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards, and to promote wise use of the special flood hazard area by: 
a.  Prohibiting certain uses which are dangerous to life or property in time of flood. 
b.  Restricting uses which would be hazardous to the public health in time of flood. 
c.  Restricting uses which are so particularly susceptible to flood damage, so as to alleviate hardship and reduce demands for public expenditures for relief and protection. 
d.  Restricting permitted special flood hazard area uses, including public facilities which serve such uses, to be protected against floods by providing floodproofing and general flood protection at the time of initial construction. 
2.  To protect occupants of the special flood hazard area from a flood which is or may be caused by their own, or other, land use and which is or may be undertaken without full realization of the danger through: 
a.  Regulating the manner in which structures designed for human occupancy may be constructed so as to prevent danger to human life within such structures. 
b.  Regulating the method of construction of water supply and sanitation systems so as to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
c.  Delineating and describing areas that could be inundated by floods so as to protect individuals from purchasing lands for purposes which are not in fact suitable. 
d.  Ensuring that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard. 
e.  Ensuring that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions. 
3.  To protect the public from the burden of extraordinary financial expenditures for flood control and relief. 
a.  Regulating all uses within the special flood hazard area so as to produce a method of construction and a pattern of development which will minimize the probability of damage to property and loss of life or injury to the inhabitants of the flood hazard areas. 
b.  Minimizing the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
c.  Minimizing prolonged business interruptions. 
d.  Minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard. 
e.  Helping maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood-blight areas. 
f.  Participating in the National Flood Insurance Program to assist property owners in obtaining adequate insurance coverage. 
4.  To protect the hydraulic characteristics and storage capacity of the special flood hazard area and small watercourses, including the gulches, sloughs, and artificial water channels, used for conveying floodwaters so as to promote retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows which can reasonably be expected to occur by: 
a.  Regulating filling, dumping, dredging, and alteration of channels by deepening, widening or relocating, so as to maintain natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics. 
b.  Prohibiting unnecessary encroachments. 
c.  Encouraging uses such as agriculture, open space, recreation, greenbelt, trails, and intermittent parking. 
d.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
e.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
f.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.

    New manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision. A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, final site grading, the construction of concrete pads, or the construction of streets) is completed on or after the effective date of these regulations. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA). The land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued for any improvement; provided, that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure. Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires a more or less permanent location on or in the ground. Includes, but is not limited to, objects such as buildings, factories, sheds, cabins, manufactured housing, and fences. This term does not include signs, utility or light poles. 
    Substantial improvement. Any addition, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assume safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places at the effective date of these regulations. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

(Ord. No. 1544 , § 1, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 26-803. - General provisions. 
A.  Jurisdiction. The provisions of this article shall apply to all lands within the SFHA as defined on the official maps and engineering reports of the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado and areas removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a LOMR-F. 
B.  Establishment of floodplain permit. A floodplain permit, either class I or class II shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of these regulations. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed within the SFHA without full compliance with these regulations and other applicable regulations. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Wheat Ridge from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. These regulations meet the minimum requirements as set forth by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
D.  Boundaries. The boundaries of the SFHA have been defined by computing the 100-year flood limits under existing channel and floodplain conditions as shown on the official maps and engineering reports. 
    The boundaries of the SFHA shall be as they appear on the official maps and engineering reports kept on file in the office of the floodplain administrator. The boundary lines on the map shall be determined by the use of the scale and other surface features appearing on the map. When there is a conflict between the boundary lines illustrated on the map and the actual field conditions, the dispute shall be settled according to section 26-808. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these floodplain regulations, these provisions shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Colorado Statutes or the Charter or ordinances of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
F.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by these floodplain regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on nationally recognized and/or published engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside SFHA boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will always be totally free from flooding or flood damage. Anyone constructing new structures within the SFHA is accepting complete responsibility for non-regulated events. These regulations shall not create a liability on the part of or a cause of action against the City of Wheat Ridge or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on these regulations. 
G.  Official maps and engineering reports. The location and boundaries of the SFHA shall be as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in "The Flood Insurance Study for Jefferson County, Colorado and Incorporated Areas," dated February 5, 2014, and any amendments or revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
    The location and boundaries of the SFHA shall be as shown in the following engineering reports and accompanying maps: 
1.  Digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM) panels dated February 5, 2014 for portions of the City of Wheat Ridge. 
The DFIRM constitute the current flood insurance study for the City of Wheat Ridge and is fully incorporated herein by this. The DFIRM which constitute the flood insurance study is on file at the Wheat Ridge Municipal Building, 7500 West 29th Avenue, Wheat Ridge, Colorado. 
H.  Severability. These regulations and various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of these regulations be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of these regulations as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 1544 , § 1, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 26-804. - Special flood hazard area. 
A.  Application and description. 
1.  The SFHA includes all lands that are inundated by the 100-year flood as shown on the official maps and engineering reports for the City of Wheat Ridge. 

Figure 26-804.1. Special Flood Hazard Area
2.  Based upon the official maps and engineering reports for the City of Wheat Ridge, the SFHA contains several elements (see Figure 26-804.1 above). 
3.  The respective regulations of section 26-805 and section 26-806 shall regulate all lands within the SFHA. 
(Ord. No. 1544 , § 1, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 26-805. - Floodway regulations. 
A.  Application and description. These regulations shall apply to all properties designated as within the floodway. Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State of Colorado has adopted floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard (see definition of floodway in section 26-802). Located within SFHA established in section 26-804, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered professional engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a no-rise certification) in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If section 26-805.A.1. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 26-806. 
3.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA. 
B.  Permitted uses. The following open uses shall be permitted within the floodway to the extent that they are not prohibited in a particular area by any underlying zoning and do not include any structures, filling or deposition of materials, and do not cause any increase in the base flood elevation of the floodway. 
1.  Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, forestry, and urban gardens; 
2.  Public and private recreational uses not requiring permanent or temporary structures such as parks, swimming areas, picnic grounds, wildlife and nature preserves, and fishing and hiking areas; 
3.  Utility facilities such as ditches, transmission lines, pipelines, water monitoring devices, roadways, and bridges; 
4.  Uses very similar in nature to these permitted uses may be allowed, provided that they are consistent with the provisions of these regulations. 
Except for the agricultural uses, the other uses shall require a class 1 floodplain permit in accordance with section 26-808. 
C.  Special exceptions. The following uses are permitted in the floodway subject to special requirements as noted: 
1.  Structures for human occupancy which were in existence as of February 26, 2001, subject to section 26-807 (nonconforming uses) and the requirements of section 26-806.D., E. and F., provided, however, that a floodplain permit shall not be required. 
D.  Prohibited uses. 
1.  Structures, fill, or deposition of materials shall be prohibited in the floodway. 
2.  The storage or processing of materials that are buoyant, flammable, or explosive, or any hazardous liquid or soluble matter which in times of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life shall be prohibited within the floodway. 
(Ord. No. 1544 , § 1, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 26-806. - Special flood hazard area regulations. 
A.  Application and description. These regulations shall apply to all properties designated as within the SFHA. 
B.  Permitted uses. The permitted uses in the SFHA are the same as those uses permitted in section 26-805.B. However, in the SFHA, floodplain permits may be applied for as specified in subsections C. and D. 
C.  Prohibited uses hazardous materials. The storage or processing of materials that are buoyant, flammable, or explosive, or any hazardous liquid or soluble matter which in times of flooding could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life shall be prohibited within the SFHA. 
D.  Development standards. The following regulations shall apply to all permitted development and uses within the SFHA: 
1.  All new structures which are walled and roofed and greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in size must be elevated one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
2.  All development shall be evaluated based on any analysis of an equal degree of encroachment based on conveyance of the 100-year flood extending for a significant reach on both sides. 
3.  No SFHA uses shall adversely affect the efficiency of or unduly restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems. 
4.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and to withstand hydrodynamic loads. 
5.  All new construction, substantial improvements, and fences shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
6.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
7.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
8.  All development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
9.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems and all replacement onsite disposal systems shall be designed and located so as to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into them and discharge from the systems into floodwaters. The location of any new onsite disposal system is prohibited. Existing systems may be repaired and maintained, including replacement, subject to the requirements of this paragraph 9. 
10.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
11.  All development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
12.  All manufactured homes to be placed within the SFHA must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement and capable of resisting the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads created by the 100-year flood. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Specific requirements may be: 
a.  Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four (4) corners of the manufactured home, with two (2) additional ties per side at intermediate locations and manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long requiring one (1) additional tie per side; 
b.  Frame ties shall be provided at each corner of the home, with five (5) additional ties per side at intermediate points and manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long requiring four (4) additional ties per side; 
c.  All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) pounds; and 
d.  Any additions to the manufactured home shall be similarly anchored. 
13.  Any fill or deposition of materials must be shown to have some beneficial purpose and the amount thereof will not be greater than is necessary to achieve that purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing the final dimensions of the proposed fill or other material and the use to which the filled land will be put. 
14.  Any fill or deposition that does reduce hydraulic capacity shall require appropriate hydraulic studies including an equal degree of encroachment analysis and a review of the urban impact of such reduction. 
15.  Any fill or deposition will be protected against erosion by riprap, strong vegetative cover, bulkheading, or other accepted means of erosion protection. 
16.  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
E.  Properties removed from the floodplain by fill. The following regulations shall apply to all permitted development and uses within the properties that have been removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill: 
1.  All new structures which are walled and roofed and greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in size must be elevated one (1) foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
3.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
4.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
F.  Critical facilities. A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
1.  Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the city council to identify and confirm that specific structures in their community meet the following criteria: 
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) essential services; (b) hazardous materials; (c) at-risk populations; and (d) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
(1)  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage, and, emergency operation centers); 
(2)  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
(3)  Designated emergency shelters; 
(4)  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits); 
(5)  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service lines); and 
(6)  Air transportation lifelines (airports (municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars)). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this section, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the city council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include: 
(1)  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing): 
(2)  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
(3)  Refineries; 
(4)  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
(5)  Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a material safety data sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place and the chemical(s) is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the threshold planning quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
Specific exemptions to this category include: 
(1)  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
(2)  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
(3)  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this section. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. These facilities consist of: 
(1)  Elder care (nursing homes): 
(2)  Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (day care and assisted living); 
(3)  Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving twelve (12) or more children); 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. These facilities consist of: 
(1)  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
(2)  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the city council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the city council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
2.  Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the SFHA shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this section, protection shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  Location outside the SFHA; or 
b.  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. 
3.  Ingress and egress for new critical facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the city council, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event.

A.  In addition to historic designation, or at any time after granting historic designation, the city council may, upon application therefore, grant community significance variances to historic landmarks. 
B.  When a community significance variance is sought after historic designation has already been granted, the notice and hearing requirements for granting such a variance shall be as set out in section 26-905E., except that the notice shall state that an application has been filed for a community significance variance. 
C.  The criterion for determining that a variance should be granted is that the variance is necessary to preserve the historic character and/or significance of the affected structure. 
D.  The variance shall remain in effect only until such time as the use which created the historic character of the landmark changes or ceases. Failure to maintain the subject of a variance in good repair and working order may cause a rescission of the variance.

B.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any construction, alteration removal, or demolition necessary to correct an unsafe or dangerous condition of any structure, or parts thereof where such condition is declared unsafe or dangerous by the city building or community development departments, or fire department and where the proposed measures have been declared necessary by the city manager to correct the dangerous condition, as long as only such work which is necessary to correct the condition is performed. Any temporary measures required by the city under this section may be taken without first obtaining a landmark alteration permit, but a permit is required for permanent alteration, removal or demolition of an historic landmark. 
C.  If the city provides the applicant with a landmark alteration permit, the applicant must apply for a building permit within six (6) months of the date of the permit. 
D.  If the city denies a landmark alteration permit, no person may submit a subsequent application for the same construction, alteration, removal or demolition within one (1) year from the date of the final action upon the earlier application. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1416, § 5, 7-28-08)

C.  The community development director shall determine whether the landmark alteration permit application requests a "major change" or a "minor change" to the historic landmark. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1416, § 6, 7-28-08) 
Sec. 26-910. - Minor change landmark alteration permits. 
A.  In determining whether to grant an application for a minor change landmark alteration permit, the community development director shall grant the permit if the requested alteration to a historic landmark would preserve, enhance or restore the exterior architectural features of the landmark or site. The proposed work shall not adversely affect the special character or special historical, architectural or archaeological nature of the landmark or site. 
B.  The owner may appeal the determination of the community development director to grant or deny a minor change landmark alteration permit to the city council within ten (10) working days of the date of the community development director's determination by filing an appeal with the office of the city clerk. Within thirty-five (35) days of the date the appeal is received the city council shall set a date for a hearing which hearing shall be held no later than sixty (60) days after the date the appeal is received. The city council shall have the power to overrule the community development director's decision. The determination of the city council following the appeal hearing shall be the final determination of the city.

Sec. 26-913. - Removal of historic designation. 
A.  An application for removal of historic designation may be submitted by the owner of the property which holds such designation as in subsection 26-905C. The application shall be processed in the same manner as in subsections 26-905C. through 26-905D., and section 26-906 except that the criteria for removal of historic designation shall be that: 
1.  The property has ceased to meet the criteria for historic designation because the qualities which caused it to be originally listed have been lost or destroyed; or 
2.  Additional information shows that the structure or property no longer meets any of the criteria for historic designation contained in section 26-906; or 
3.  Upon a change in ownership, at the request of the new owner, but only to the extent public financial assistance has not been received to benefit the exterior historic elements of the property.

ARTICLE X. - INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 26-1001. - Interpretation of zoning code. 
    In interpreting and applying the provisions of this zoning code, said provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare. It is not intended by this zoning code to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or agreements between parties; provided, however, that wherever this zoning code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land or upon the location or height of buildings or structures or required larger open spaces about buildings than are imposed or required by other laws, regulations or by easements, covenants or agreements between parties, the provisions of this zoning code shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-1002. - Severability. 
    If any part or parts of this zoning code are for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of the remaining portions of this zoning code. The city council hereby declares that it would have adopted this zoning code and each part or parts thereof irrespective of the fact that any one (1) part or parts be declared invalid or unconstitutional. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01) 
Sec. 26-1003. - Application to developments in process. 
A.  All site developments initiated on and after February 26, 2001, shall be reviewed pursuant to the review process and standards set forth in this chapter, as amended by Ordinance 2000, and effective on that date. All site developments submitted for review prior to February 26, 2001, shall be reviewed pursuant to the process and under the criteria set forth in applicable portions of this chapter in force prior to that date. Such prior regulations are continued in force and effect for that limited purpose only. Upon approval or denial of all such remaining applications, the prior regulations shall be deemed repealed. In no event shall any resubmission of an application after its rejection or any development application filed after the effective date of these regulations be reviewed under any such prior regulations. 
B.  On the effective date of the enactment of this section (February 26, 2001), there exist within the city numerous preliminary and final site development approvals of various types, including rezoning approvals, planned development approvals, conditional and special use permit approvals, and issued building permits. The council hereby declares that each and every one (1) of said approvals shall be subject to the requirements of this section; provided, however, that for the purpose of measuring the time of expiration of such approvals, each and every such approval shall be deemed to have been issued on the effective date of this section (February 26, 2001). A preexisting conditional use approval shall be considered a special use approval complete with all of the rights, benefits, and limitations as originally issued. It is the intent of this section that such preexisting approvals, issued prior to the effective date of this section, not be deprived of the full benefit of the periods of time granted prior to expiration, all as provided herein.

7.  Any provision, requirement, or standard of this chapter. 
C.  The director of community development is authorized and directed to make the determination that an activity or use of structures or land is contrary to the foregoing permits, conditions, approvals, provisions, requirements, and standards contained in subsections B.1. through 7., hereof. 
(Ord. No. 2001-1215, § 1, 2-26-01; Ord. No. 1232, § 1, 11-26-01; Ord. No. 1288, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-03; Ord. No. 1515, § 11, 7-9-12) 
Sec. 26-1005. - Civil enforcement. 
A.  Whenever an alleged violation of any of the provisions of chapter 26 has not been voluntarily abated within the time specified in any notice issued pursuant to this Code of Laws, the city may bring a civil action in the municipal court to have the violation declared as such by the court and to have the court enjoin the violation or to authorize its restraint, removal, termination or abatement by the owner, agent, occupant or person who caused the violation or the person who allowed the violation to continue, or by the director of community development, or the chief of police or their designated representatives. 
B.  The civil action to declare and abate a violation of this chapter shall be brought in the name of the City of Wheat Ridge by filing a complaint, which shall be verified or supported by an affidavit. Summons and subpoena shall be issued and served as in civil cases. Any employee or agent of the City of Wheat Ridge who is over the age of eighteen (18) may serve a summons and verified complaint upon the owner, agent, occupant or the person who caused or allowed the violation (hereinafter "respondent") or a subpoena upon any witness to the violation. Trial shall be to the court. 
C.  A notice of appearance shall be served with the summons and complaint. The appearance date shall be not less than twenty-one (21) days from the date of service of the summons and complaint. The respondent shall file a response or answer on or before the appearance date specified in the notice of appearance. The trial shall be held upon the appearance date, unless the court grants a continuance for good cause shown. No case shall be continued for more than sixty (60) days after the appearance date. 
D.  Upon the date and time specified for appearance and trial, if the respondent has filed no response and fails to appear, and if the city proves that proper service was made on respondent at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the appearance date, the court may grant such orders as are requested by the city; except that, the court shall order the enforcement by the city be stayed for ten (10) days and that a copy of the court's order be mailed to the respondent at his last known address. Failure to appear on any date set for hearing and trial shall be grounds for entering a default and default judgment against the non-appearing party. Prior to enforcement, and upon good cause shown, the court may set aside an entry of default and the default judgment entered thereon. 
E.  Any disobedience to or interference with any injunction or order issued by the municipal court in an action to abate a violation of this chapter of the Wheat Ridge Code of Laws may be punished as a contempt of court or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each day's failure to comply with an injunction or order to abate shall constitute a separate act of contempt for which an additional penalty may be imposed. 
F.  In order to facilitate just, speedy, informal and inexpensive determinations of claims, the court shall follow the Rules of County Court Civil Procedure, as presently adopted and as hereinafter amended from time to time, excepting Rules 302, 313, 338, 339, 347, 348, 350, 351, 351.1, 359(c)(2), 365, 383, 398, 402, 403, 404, and 406 thereof, and shall further utilize and follow the provisions of Rule 65 of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure in all cases wherein civil enforcement of the provisions of this chapter is sought. In the event of any discrepancy between any of the provisions of this chapter and those applicable Rules of County Court Civil Procedure or Rule 65 of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure adopted hereby, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail and be applied. 
    The right is expressly reserved and delegated to the presiding judge of the Wheat Ridge Municipal Court to adopt rules of procedure for the Wheat Ridge Municipal Court, which rules shall be applicable in any civil enforcement action brought by the city; provided, however, that said rules of procedure adopted and promulgated by the presiding judge of this court shall not conflict with or contradict the authority of the city to pursue civil endorsement for violations of the provisions of this chapter. 
G.  In any case in which the city prevails in a civil action initiated pursuant to subsection A., the city may recover its reasonable costs of abating the violation, including reasonable costs of litigation, plus fifteen (15) percent in administrative costs; plus costs may be assessed against the subject property pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 16-13-313 and 16-13-314. The remedies specified in this subsection shall be in addition to all other remedies provided by law.

Sec. 26-1006. - Criminal actions and penalty. 
    When an alleged violation of any of the provisions of this chapter 26, has not been voluntarily abated within the time specified in any notice issued by the city: 
A.  The city may bring a criminal action in the municipal court to have the violation declared as such by the court and to have the court impose sentence upon the owner, agent, occupant or person who caused the violation or the person who allowed the violation to continue. 
B.  The criminal action to declare a violation of this chapter shall be brought in the name of the People of the State of Colorado by serving a copy of the summons and complaint upon the alleged violator (hereinafter "defendant") and filing the original with the court. Summons and complaint and subpoena shall be served as in criminal actions. Any employee or agent of the City of Wheat Ridge who is over the age of eighteen (18) may serve a summons and complaint upon the defendant or a subpoena upon any witness to the violation. Such criminal action shall be prosecuted pursuant to the Colorado Municipal Court Rules. 
C.  Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction of such violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, or both such fine and imprisonment; provided, however, that no person under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be subject to imprisonment for a violation of this chapter.

ARTICLE XI. - MIXED USE ZONE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 26-1101. - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of the mixed use commercial (MU-C) and mixed use neighborhood (MU-N) zone districts is to create a flexible approach to land uses and enhance the character of Wheat Ridge's commercial corridors and centers by promoting development that: 
1.  Creates a balanced mix of land uses; 
2.  Supports a sustainable and resilient local economy; 
3.  Provides unique places for people to live, work, shop, and play; 
4.  Improves the public realm through high quality design; 
5.  Promotes use by pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users, in addition to automobiles; 
6.  Encourages active lifestyles; and 
7.  Maintains the character and integrity of adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1102. - Districts established. 
A.  Mixed use commercial (MU-C) zone district. This district, generally located along major commercial corridors and at community and employment activity centers, is established to encourage medium to high density mixed use development. In addition to residential and civic uses, it allows for a wide range of commercial and retail uses. 
1.  MU-C transit oriented development sub-district (MU-C TOD). This sub-district is intended for areas within one-half mile of fixed guideway rail stations, including light rail and commuter rail. It follows the MU-C framework but is specifically designed to allow densities that support transit ridership and to encourage land uses and building form that enhance connections to transit. 
2.  MU-C interstate sub-district (MU-C Interstate). This sub-district is intended for properties that are generally within five hundred (500) feet of Interstate-70 and that are located on a commercial corridor with direct access to Interstate-70. It follows the MU-C framework but is intended for highway-adjacent sites that may require variation in design or land use due to direct proximity to the interstate. 
B.  Mixed use neighborhood (MU-N). This district, generally located along neighborhood main streets and at neighborhood commercial centers, is established to encourage medium density mixed use development. In addition to residential and civic uses, it allows for a more limited range of neighborhood-serving commercial and retail uses. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1103. - Applicability. 
A.  All standards and requirements within article XI shall apply to: 
1.  Site development; 
2.  Expansion of existing structures by more than fifteen (15) percent of the gross floor area. 
B.  Legal nonconforming uses. Where a use lawfully existed at the time of rezoning of the subject property to any mixed use district within this article, and which is not a permitted use at that time under section 26-1111, Permitted Uses, such nonconforming use may continue to operate and exist, subject to section 26-120.C.6, subject to the following. 
1.  A structure containing a nonconforming use may expand its gross floor area by a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent without requiring a change to a conforming use. 
2.  No use that lawfully existed at the time of rezoning of the subject property to any mixed use district shall be deemed a nonconforming use due to the requirement for a conditional use permit. However, if an existing use is designated as a conditional use in section 26-1111, any expansion of that use shall require a conditional use permit (per section 26-1118). 
3.  No use that lawfully existed at the time of rezoning of the subject property to any mixed use district shall be deemed a nonconforming use due to the separation requirements established in section 26-1111. 
C.  Legal nonconforming structures. Where a structure lawfully existed at the time of rezoning of the subject property to any mixed use district, and which would not be allowed by the provisions within this article because of either building placement or orientation, building design, parking placement or design, parking requirements, or site and vehicular access, such structure may continue to exist and may be enlarged, altered or added to provided that the alteration or addition does not increase the nonconformity. 
1.  Any new addition or expansion to a nonconforming structure shall comply with all provisions within this article, where practical. The community development director shall determine if there is a requirement that cannot be practically met. Such determination may be appealed to the board of adjustment. 
D.  Wherever provisions within this article conflict with other articles in chapter 26, the provisions within article XI shall apply. 
E.  Where standards for the MU-C TOD and MU-C Interstate sub-districts are not specifically stated, MU-C standards shall apply. 
F.  The illustrations that appear in this article are for illustrative purposes only. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1104. - Building height. 
A.  Principle. Taller buildings allow for a range of uses within one (1) structure and encourage a compact form of development that is focused on pedestrian connections. Buildings with a similar range in height help to define the street wall and create an architectural identity for a corridor or area. 
B.  The following table establishes required building heights. Whatever measurement is more restrictive - maximum stories or maximum feet - shall apply. 
Building Height Requirements MU-C MU-C Interstate MU-C TOD MU-N Minimum height 20' 20' 20' none Maximum height Mixed use building 6 stories (90') 8 stories (118') 8 stories (118') see C. below Single use building 4 stories (62') 6 stories (90') 6 stories (90')  
C.  In the MU-N district, any building containing a residential use shall have a maximum height of thirty-five (35) feet. All other buildings shall have a maximum height of fifty (50) feet. 
D.  Where there is conflict regarding maximum building heights between this section and the city charter, the maximums established in the city charter shall apply. 
E.  A parapet wall may be utilized to meet the minimum height requirement. 
F.  For buildings over seventy-five (75) feet in height, see section 26-1106.G, Upper Story Stepbacks. 
G.  Any portion of a building that is within one hundred (100) feet of a residentially or agriculturally zoned lot that has a single- or two-family residential use shall not exceed a height of four (4) stories or sixty-two (62) feet, whichever is more restrictive. The one-hundred-foot distance shall be measured from the nearest property line of the residentially or agriculturally zoned lot. This requirement shall not apply where an arterial or collector street separates the building from the residential use. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1105. - Building placement and orientation. 
A.  Principle. In order to activate streets and enhance the pedestrian experience, buildings are encouraged to be placed close to the street and oriented toward the public realm. 
B.  Public entrances. All buildings are encouraged to have at least one (1) public entry that faces the primary or secondary street. 
1.  Within the MU-N sub-district, each building shall have at least one (1) main public entry that faces the primary street or a public space adjacent to the building. For corner lots with more than one (1) street frontage, the public entry may be oriented toward the corner. 
2.  In all districts, for development sites with more than one (1) structure, those buildings that do not directly front a street shall have at least one (1) primary entrance that adjoins a pedestrian walk. The primary entrance should be connected to the street by a walkway that is clearly defined and separated from parking areas. 
C.  Building setbacks. Setbacks establish the minimum distance between a building façade and the nearest property line (Figure 1). The following table establishes minimum side and rear setback requirements for all structures in the MU-C and MU-N districts. Front setbacks are not required; instead, build-to areas established in section 26-1105.F encourage buildings to be built close to the street. 
Building Setbacks MU-C MU-N Minimum side setback 0' 0' Minimum rear setback 5' 5' Where abutting a residentially or agriculturally zoned lot that contains a single- or two-family residential use (see § 26-1106.H Residential Transitions): Minimum side and rear setback: 1-2 story building 10' 10' Minimum side and rear setback: 3 story building 15' 15' Minimum side and rear setback: 4 story building and higher 20' 20'  
D.  Right-of-way encroachments. architectural elements attached to the building façade may encroach into the right-of-way up to three (3) feet at the ground floor, and up to five (5) feet at upper levels, subject to an approved right-of-way use permit through the department of public works. Such encroachments may include window planter boxes, eaves, balconies, projecting wall signs, canopies, and awnings. 
Figure 1

Figure 1: Setbacks and Build-To Area. 

A: Build-to area: building may be anywhere within this area, and is required to fill at least part of it. 
B: Side setback: building may not encroach into this area. 
C: Rear setback: building may not encroach into this area. 
E.  Build-to areas. Build-to areas are intended to bring building façades toward the street. A build-to area requires that a minimum portion of each development site's street frontage is occupied by a building, encouraging an active and interesting street frontage. The following table establishes build-to requirements for each district. 
Build-To Areas MU-C MU-N Primary Street Frontage Build-to area 0' - 20' 0' - 12' Linear portion of build-to area that must contain building façade (minimum) See Figures 2 and 3 50% 60% Secondary Street Frontage Build-to area 0' - 20' 0' - 12' Linear portion of build-to area that must contain building façade (minimum) See Figures 2 and 3 30% 30%  
1.  In certain instances, where the provided primary street build-to exceeds the minimum requirement, the required secondary street build-to may be reduced by an equal or lesser amount, subject to approval by the community development director. 
Figure 2

Figure 2: Build-To Area for Development Site with One Building. Both images in this figure illustrate the same site from different views. In this case, fifty (50) percent of the build-to area along the primary and secondary streets is occupied by a building. 
2.  For a development site with more than one (1) building, not all buildings must meet the build-to requirement, as long as those buildings closest to the street fulfill the requirements set forth in the table above (Figure 3). 
Figure 3

Figure 3: Build-To Area for Development Site with Multiple Buildings. The required primary and secondary street build-to areas may be fulfilled by more than one (1) building. Build-to requirements only apply to those buildings closest to the street. 
3.  For a development site with more than one (1) building, built-to requirements may be met by a future phase. In such cases, the parcel(s) of any future building(s) required to meet the build-to requirement must be platted and recorded prior to issuance of a building permit for the first phase of development. 
4.  Gas stations may meet build-to requirements through one (1) or any combination of the following two (2) elements: (1) Structure within the build-to area; (2) Canopy within the build-to area (Figures 4 and 5). Gas stations must also provide a screen wall, thirty (30) to forty-two (42) inches in height, for one hundred (100) percent of the primary and secondary street frontage, excluding access points and where portions of the building are within the build-to area. The screen wall shall be a continuous masonry wall constructed of stone, brick, or split-face concrete block, or a combination masonry pier and decorative iron railing. There shall be a minimum four-foot-wide landscape buffer between the screen wall and property line.

Sec. 26-1106. - Building design. 
A.  Principle. Quality architecture is a vital component to creating a unique sense of "place." Creative design that pays careful attention to the building's contribution to the public realm - through massing, form, materials, and its relationship to the street - is encouraged. 
B.  Façade design and articulation. 
1.  All façades of a building shall provide a level of finished architectural quality and be designed to human scale. Each façade shall contain at least one (1) change in color or texture. Additional detail should be incorporated into the façade design by the use of at least three (3) of the following methods: 
  Reveals. 
  Belt courses. 
  Cornices. 
  Expression of a structural or architectural bay. 
  Articulation of windows and doorways, which may include sills, mullions, or pilasters that create a three-dimensional expression. 
  Change in material. 
2.  All façades of a building that face a street or a public space shall have at least one (1) variation in plane depth of at least one (1) foot for every fifty (50) linear feet of the length of the façade. All other façades shall have one (1) variation in plane depth of at least one (1) foot for every one hundred (100) linear feet of the length of the façade. Any portion of a façade that is a glass curtain wall shall be exempted from this requirement. 
3.  Non-permanent features such as canopies and awnings will not qualify as variation. Plane depth variation may be accomplished through elements such as: 
  Recessed entries. 
  Porticos. 
  Upper level stepbacks. 
  Dormers. 
  Offsets in the general plane of the façade, including columns, pilasters, protruding bays, reveals, fins, ribs, balconies, cornices or eaves. 
4.  The primary entrance of a building shall be emphasized through at least two (2) of the following architectural elements: 
  Changes in wall plane or building massing. 
  Differentiation in material and/or color. 
  Higher level of detail. 
  Enhanced lighting. 
C.  Materials. 
1.  Only primary building materials shall be used for all façades. Primary building materials include, but are not limited to:

  Synthetic brick and masonry materials. 
  Hard coat stucco. 
  Integral textured colored concrete block. 
  Terra-cotta. 
  Architectural metal panels. 
2.  Materials that are not allowed include, but are not limited to: 
  Plywood paneling. 
  Vinyl and aluminum siding. 
  Un-articulated large format concrete panels. 
3.  Exterior insulating finishing system (EIFS) may be used as an accent material subject to the following restrictions: 
  EIFS must have a textured finish. 
  EIFS may not be utilized below the height of eight (8) feet on any building façade. 
  The total amount of EIFS may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent per building façade. 
  The allowable amount of EIFS may be consolidated on a façade(s) that does not face a street or public space provided that the total amount of EIFS, calculated cumulatively for the entire building, does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent. 
4.  Material variation: All building façades that face a street or public space shall have at least one (1) change in material for each ten (10) feet (and portion thereof) of wall height. A change in material must be at least twelve (12) inches in height. Masonry patterns, such as headers or rowlocks, can count as a change of material. Windows, canopies, and doorways will not count as a change in material. 
D.  Ground floor transparency. 
1.  Retail uses. The façade facing the primary street frontage shall be at least sixty (60) percent transparent. All other façades facing a street or public space shall be at least thirty (30) percent transparent. 
2.  All other nonresidential uses (excluding retail). The façade facing the primary street frontage shall be at least forty (40) percent transparent. All other façades facing a street or public space shall be at least twenty-five (25) percent transparent. 
3.  Transparency shall be calculated as the percentage of clear, non-reflective glass within the area between three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the first floor finished elevation. 
4.  Transparent doors and window mullions shall count as part of the transparent area. Structural elements and opaque or reflective glass shall not count toward the transparency requirement, except that up to twenty (20) percent of the transparency requirement for any one (1) façade may be fulfilled by spandrel glass. 
5.  Glass display cases may count toward the transparency requirement only if they give the appearance of windows, are at least eighteen (18) inches deep, and are maintained with items of interest, including window display graphics. 
6.  For retail uses, windows at the ground floor shall be at least five (5) feet high. 
E.  Drive-throughs and drive-ups. 
1.  Drive-up windows. Where drive-throughs and drive-ups are allowed (see section 26-1111, Permitted Uses), the drive-up window shall be placed at the side or rear of a building and shall not be located at street corners. 
2.  Number of drive-up lanes. The following table specifies the maximum number of drive-up lanes allowed by district and sub-district: 
Maximum Number of Drive-Up Lanes Allowed MU-C MU-C 
Interstate MU-C TOD MU-N Max drive-up lanes 3 no limit 1 1  
3.  Location of drive-up lanes. Drive-up lanes between the building and the street are discouraged. Within the MU-N district and MU-C TOD sub-district, the drive-up lane shall not be located between the building and the primary street (Figure 6). 
4.  Screening of drive-up lanes. Any drive-up lane that is visible from a street or public space shall incorporate the following screening elements: 
  A screen wall, at least thirty-six (36) inches in height, with materials that are consistent with the primary building. The screen wall must meet the sight-triangle requirements in section 26-603. 
  A landscaped buffer, at least four (4) feet in width, between the property line and the screen wall (Figure 7). 
  Where there is more than one (1) drive-up lane, canopies or other structural elements shall be used for further screening. These screening elements shall be compatible with the architectural qualities of the main building, including materials, form, scale, and color. 
5.  Screening of drive-up lanes adjacent to residentially or agriculturally zoned lots with a residential use. The landscape buffer and screening requirements for parking lots adjacent to residential uses, per section 26-1107.C.2, shall apply. 
6.  The drive-through stacking requirements in section 26-501.E.10 shall not apply. 
Figure 6

  
Figure 6: Drive-up Lane Location. Within the MU-N district and MU-C TOD sub-district, the drive-up lane may not be located between the building and the primary street. 
Figure 7

  
Figure 7: Drive-through Screening. Where a drive-up lane is visible from the street, a minimum thirty-six (36) inch high screen wall and four-foot-wide landscape buffer are required. 
F.  Screening-Loading, service areas, and utilities. 
1.  All loading docks, utility structures, and other service areas associated with a building shall be fully screened from view by walls or fences (Figure 8). 
2.  Screening elements shall be composed of materials consistent with the primary building. Wood and vinyl fences shall not be allowed as screening materials. Screen walls and fences over ten (10) feet in length shall be bordered by a four-foot-wide landscape buffer. 
3.  Trash enclosures shall be compatible with the building design and materials and screened with full wall enclosures. Such enclosures may not be located between the building façade and the street. 
4.  All screening elements shall be at least as tall as the object (e.g. trash enclosure, loading dock, or utility structure) being screened. 
5.  Rooftop equipment shall be screened by parapets or enclosures. Screening elements shall be composed of forms, materials, and colors that are compatible with the architectural qualities of the building, including materials, scale, form, and color. 
6.  Wherever possible, exterior utility boxes and above-ground utility installations shall be located to the side or rear of buildings, and not visible from the street. 
Figure 8

Figure 8: Screening. Loading docks, service areas, and utility structures must be screened by walls or fences that are consistent with the primary building materials. 
G.  Upper story stepbacks. 
1.  For buildings taller than seventy-five (75) feet, an upper level stepback is required for any façade that faces a street or a public space. For such façades, the portion of the façade over seventy-five (75) feet in height must stepback at least ten (10) feet from the outer edge of the first story (Figure 9). 
2.  Terraces and unenclosed balconies may extend up to eight (8) feet into the required upper level stepback area. 
Figure 9

Figure 9: Upper Story Stepback. For building façades over seventy-five (75) feet in height that face a street or public space, any portion of the façade over seventy-five (75) feet in height must step back at least ten (10) feet. 
H.  Residential transitions. 
1.  Landscaped buffers. Where new development abuts a residentially or agriculturally zoned lot that contains a single- or two-family residential use, the required setbacks in section 26-1105.D shall apply. The required setback area shall be landscaped with grass and trees and/or shrubs. 
2.  Upper story stepbacks. The following upper story stepbacks shall be required for any building in a mixed use district that abuts a residentially or agriculturally zoned lot that contains a single- or two-family residential use. The required stepbacks shall apply to any façade, side or rear, that faces the lot with the residential use (Figure 10). 
Residential Transition - Required Upper Story Stepbacks MU-C MU-N Minimum Setback - stories 1-2 (see § 26-1105.C) 1-2 story building 10' 10' 3 story building 15' 15' 4 story building and higher 20' 20' Minimum Stepback - stories 3-4 5' per story 5' per story Minimum Stepback - stories 4 and above 30' 30'

(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1107. - Off-street parking placement and design. 
A.  Principle. Streets are more vibrant and interesting to pedestrians if they are lined with buildings and active uses. Surface parking should be located behind buildings, toward the interior of lots, and should be screened from view from adjacent streets. Structured parking should be placed to minimize impacts on surrounding development and be designed to be compatible - in terms of form, materials, and architectural style - with adjacent development. 
B.  Surface parking placement. Parking areas shall be located to the rear or side of the building. For development sites with more than one (1) building, parking is not allowed in front of the building(s) closest to the street, but is allowed in front of permitted buildings interior to the development site (Figure 11). 
Figure 11

Figure 11: Off-street Parking Location for Development Site with Multiple Buildings. Parking must be to the rear or side of buildings closest to the street, but is permitted in front of buildings interior to the site. 
C.  Surface parking buffers and screening. 
1.  Where a surface parking lot directly abuts a street or public space, one (1) or more of the following screening elements shall be used: 
  Minimum five-foot wide landscape buffer with grass, or groundcover plantings, and trees located a minimum of thirty (30) feet on center. The landscape buffer may also contain perennials and shrubs. 
  A vertical screening device, thirty (30) to forty-six (46) inches in height. The screening device may be a continuous masonry wall constructed of stone, brick, or split-face concrete block, a combination masonry pier and decorative iron railing, or any other decorative and durable screening device that is consistent with the materials of the primary building. Wood, chain link and vinyl picket fencing shall not be permitted. The screen must meet the sight triangle requirements in section 26-603. 
  Where a parking lot's frontage along the street or public space is greater than twenty (20) linear feet, no more than thirty (30) percent of the screening requirement may be fulfilled by a landscape buffer. 
2.  Where a surface parking lot boundary abuts a residentially or agriculturally zoned lot with a residential use, a landscape buffer of six (6) feet from said lot boundary shall be required. Along the boundary of the lot with a residential use, a six-foot-high view-obscuring fence, decorative wall or landscaped hedge with a natural height of six (6) feet shall be provided. In addition, grass or other ground cover and trees and/or shrubs shall be planted within the landscape buffer (Figure 12). 
Figure 12

Figure 12: Parking Lots Adjacent to Residential Use. Such parking areas require a minimum six-foot landscaped buffer and screen wall between the parking area and residential use. 
D.  Surface parking design. 
1.  Parking areas shall meet the requirements for the design of off-street parking - including surfacing, landscaping, lighting, and space/aisle dimensions - stated within section 26-501.E.5., section 26-501.E.6, section 26-501.E.7 and section 26-501.E.11. 
2.  Parking lots that utilize permeable paving are encouraged. 
3.  Parking areas over twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall contain a well-defined pedestrian walk, whether by change in paving material or landscaping, that connects the parking area to the adjacent street and the building(s) on site. 
E.  Parking structure design. 
1.  Parking garage design should be compatible with adjacent buildings in terms of form, massing, scale, materials, and façade articulation. 
2.  Spandrel panels or opaque screening systems, such as louvers, at least thirty-six (36) inches in height shall be used to screen vehicles from view on all levels. 
3.  Any parking garage façade that is visible from public view shall be orthogonal in composition and so that ramping systems are not visible (Figure 13). 
4.  Wherever possible, especially for parking garage façades that face a public street, the ground floor of the parking structure should incorporate retail, commercial, or other nonresidential uses to help activate the street. 
5.  Any ground-level façade of a parking garage that is visible from the street and does not provide retail, commercial, or other active ground floor uses shall include at least two (2) of the following design features: 
  Façade articulation through change in vertical plane or a change in building material. 
  The use of windows or false windows defined by frames, lintels, or sills. 
  Integration of multiple building entrances. 
  Buffering along the street edge with landscaping, street trees, green walls, or trellises with vines. 
Figure 13

  
Figure 13: Parking Garage Design. The image on top illustrates a garage façade with an expressed ramping system, which is not allowed. The image below illustrates the same garage with a façade that is orthogonal, with all floors at ninety (90) degree angles. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1108. - Site circulation and vehicular access. 
A.  Principle. Access and circulation for automobiles should be designed to minimize the number of curb cuts, increase connectivity, and encourage shared access points from streets so that disruptions to the pedestrian environment are minimized. 
B.  Block sizes. Where new public or private streets are proposed, blocks with a perimeter of one thousand six hundred (1,600) to one thousand eight hundred (1,800) feet are encouraged and shall not be greater than two thousand (2,000) feet in perimeter. 
C.  Curb cuts. For new development along existing streets, where a curb cut already exists, the number of curb cuts to the site shall not be increased. Where possible, existing curb cuts should be consolidated. 
1.  Wherever possible, vehicular access to a site or building shall occur through an alley, rather than by a curb cut from the street. 
2.  Where an alley is not available, curb cuts along the secondary street, rather than the primary street, are encouraged. 
D.  Vehicular entrances. Vehicular entrances to buildings and parking garages that contain a ramp shall be screened from view of the street or adjacent public space. Where a vehicular entrance or ramp directly abuts a pedestrian walk, appropriate cautionary signs shall be used to alert pedestrians of the presence of vehicles and to inform drivers that pedestrians have the priority. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1109. - Parking requirements. 
A.  Principle. Large areas of free parking encourage automobile use and detract from the land available for high quality development. Strategies to utilize parking areas effectively - such as shared parking and parking structures - are highly encouraged. Especially within areas adjacent to transit services, reduced parking requirements encourage transit and other modes alternative to the automobile. 
B.  The following table specifies the number of parking spaces required by general use group. 
Use Group Minimum Required 
Parking Maximum Allowed 
Parking Hospital 1 space per bed 2 spaces per bed Light Industrial 1 space per 1,000 square feet 5 spaces per 1,000 square feet Lodging - Hotels, motels, extended stay, bed and breakfast 1 space per 2 rooms 1.5 spaces per room Office/bank 2 spaces per 1,000 square feet 5 spaces per 1,000 square feet Place of worship 1 space per each 5 seats 1 space per seat Residential 1 space per unit 2.5 spaces per unit Restaurant 4 spaces per 1,000 square feet 10 spaces per 1,000 square feet MU-C and MU-C Interstate may have a maximum of 12 spaces per 1,000 square feet Retail 3 spaces per 1,000 square feet 5 spaces per 1,000 square feet MU-C and MU-C Interstate may have a maximum of 7 spaces per 1,000 square feet Theater 1 space per 5 seats 1 space per 2 seats All other uses Uses not specifically listed above shall submit a parking analysis as part of development review for approval by the Community Development Director  
Note: square feet is measured as gross floor area 
C.  On-street parking. On-street parking spaces directly abutting the use may count toward the total number of required parking spaces. 
D.  Off-site parking. Parking requirements may be met off-site, up to a walking distance of one thousand (1,000) feet via a publicly accessible route from the use, subject to an off-site parking agreement. The publicly accessible route must be approved by the community development director. The off-site parking agreement must be submitted for approval by the community development director and, once approved, recorded against all properties subject to the agreement. 
E.  Shared parking. Shared parking is permitted and encouraged. Shared parking shall be approved subject to the review and approval of a shared parking study citing ULI accepted shared parking ratios, as may be amended. 
F.  Transit parking reductions. Properties within the MU-C TOD sub-district may reduce minimum parking requirements by twenty (20) percent. 
G.  Incentive for structured parking. Except within the MU-N district, a building that incorporates underground or structured parking qualifies for the higher building heights allowed for mixed use buildings in the building height requirements table in section 26-1104.B, even if that building is not mixed use. For a development site with a freestanding parking garage, the additional building height may be applied to a building within the development site that is served by the parking structure. This height bonus shall not apply for parking structures that contain parking at the ground floor without at least one (1) nonresidential ground floor use. 
H.  Accessible parking shall be provided in accordance with section 26-501.E.9. 
I.  Off-street loading shall be provided in accordance with section 26-501.E.8. 
J.  Bicycle parking. 
1.  For nonresidential development, or portion thereof, bicycle parking spaces shall be required at a rate of one (1) bicycle parking space for every twenty (20) automobile parking spaces. No nonresidential development shall provide less than four (4) bicycle parking spaces. 
2.  For residential development, or portion thereof, bicycle parking spaces shall be required at a rate of one (1) bicycle parking space for every ten (10) units. No multifamily residential development shall provide less than three (3) bicycle parking spaces. 
3.  Parking for bicycles shall be provided on site. Bicycle parking areas shall be well-lighted and located not more than fifty (50) feet from the primary building entrance. Bicycle parking for residential uses is encouraged to be sheltered and secured. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10) 
Sec. 26-1110. - Open space requirements. 
A.  Principle. Parks, plazas, squares and other forms of public spaces play an important role in the quality of a place. Landscaped and hardscaped areas contribute to the public realm by providing places for people to gather, relax, and recreate. 
B.  Open space required. The following table sets forth the minimum amount of open space required, measured as a percentage of the net development site area (total site area less public right-of-way). 
Minimum Required Open Space MU-C MU-N Mixed Use Development 10% 10% Single Use Development 15% 15%  
C.  Aggregated open space. Open space may be aggregated into larger parks, plazas, and squares for one (1) development site, rather than calculated per parcel, subject to approval by the community development director. In such cases, the parcel(s) required to meet any open space requirement must be identified and noted on the approved site plan on file in the community development department. 
D.  Minimum landscaping. At least thirty-five (35) percent of the required open space area shall be composed of landscaped materials, including trees. 
E.  Usable open space. For all development sites, at least seventy-five (75) percent of the required open space must be usable open space. 
1.  Usable open space includes open space which, by its configuration, size, and design, can be used for passive or active recreation. 
2.  Usable open space includes plazas, parks, outdoor dining areas, courtyards and green roofs. Required buffers or parking lot landscaping shall not qualify as usable open space. 
3.  Land with a slope steeper than one (1) foot (vertical) in three (3) feet (horizontal) shall not qualify as usable open space. 
4.  Drainage ways, ponds, and other areas required for stormwater quality or detention may qualify as usable open space if such areas are designed for passive or active use and are landscaped with grass, shrubs, and/or trees. A list of recommended plants for stormwater detention areas is available through the public works department. 
F.  Land planted for food production, including community gardens, shall qualify as open space, but not as usable open space. 
G.  Streetscaping. All new development, including expansions of an existing structure by 50 percent or more of the floor area, shall meet the requirements in the City of Wheat Ridge Streetscape Design Manual. 
H.  Maintenance. The developer, its successor and/or the property owners shall be responsible for regular weeding, irrigating, fertilizing, pruning, or other maintenance of all plantings as needed in order the ensure the survival of any required landscaping. The city may require the removal and replacement of such landscaping where dead, diseased, or damaged landscaping is found. All property owners/occupants shall be responsible for the maintenance of landscaping within the portion of the public right-of-way between the back of the curb or street pavement and adjacent private property. 
I.  The requirements of section 26-502 shall not apply within any mixed use zone. 
J.  The requirements of section 26-507 shall apply in all mixed use zone districts. 
K.  The requirements of section 26-508 shall apply in all mixed use zone districts. 
(Ord. No. 1471, § 1, 9-13-10; Ord. No. 1481, § 15, 3-28-11; Ord. No. 1618 , § 3, 4-10-17) 
Sec. 26-1111. - Permitted uses. 
A.  Principle. The mixed use zone districts emphasize building form, rather than permitted uses. A range of uses is permitted to promote mixed use development. 
B.  Permitted and special uses are shown in the following table. This table, and not the table in section 26-204, shall apply for all of the mixed use zone districts. Uses not listed shall be deemed excluded. 
1.  The community development director has the authority to determine that a use not specifically listed should be so permitted or allowed on the basis of it being similar to a listed use, compatible in character and impact with uses in the zone district, consistent with the intent of the district, and which would not be objectionable to nearby property by reason of odor, dust, fumes, gas, noise, radiation, heat, glare, vibration, traffic generation, parking needs, outdoor storage or use, or is not hazardous to the health and safety of surrounding areas through danger of fire or explosion.

Nothing that occurs during a builder's inspection may be used or introduced as evidence to support a defense of spoliation of evidence by any potential party in subsequent litigation. 
6.  A builder who fails to comply with any of the foregoing requirements within the time specified is not entitled to the protection of this article, and the homeowner is released from the requirements of this article and may proceed with the filing of an action. 
7.  If a notice is sent to the builder in accordance with this section within the time prescribed for the filing of an action under any applicable statute of limitations or repose, then the statute of limitations or repose is tolled until sixty (60) days after the completion of the notice process described in section 26-1305. If the builder elects to repair pursuant to 26-1306, then the statute of limitations or repose is tolled until sixty (60) days after the completion of repairs. The tolling imposed by this section shall be limited only to the construction defect described in the notice. 
(Ord. No. 1580 , § 1, 8-24-15) 
Sec. 26-1306. - Builder's right to repair. 
A.  Within thirty (30) days of the initial inspection or testing, the builder may elect to repair the construction defect. If the builder elects to repair the construction defect, it has the right to do so and the claimant may not, directly or indirectly, impair, impede or prohibit the builder from making repairs. Any notice to repair shall offer to compensate the claimant for all applicable damages within the timeframe set for repair. Any notice of repair shall be accompanied by a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the particular defect being repaired and setting forth a reasonable completion date for the repair work. The notice shall also include the contact information for any contractors the builder intends to employ for the repairs. 
B.  Claimant shall promptly cooperate with builder to schedule repair work by builder. 
C.  Within ten (10) days after receipt of the builder's notice to repair, a claimant may deliver to the builder a written objection to the proposed repair if the claimant believes in good faith that the proposed repair will not remedy the alleged defect. The builder may elect to modify the proposal in accordance with the claimant's objection, or may proceed with the scope of work set forth in the original proposal. 
D.  Builder's failure to comply. If the builder fails to send a notice to repair or otherwise strictly comply with this article within the specified time frames, or if the builder does not complete the repair within the time set forth in the notice to repair, the claimant shall be released from the requirements of this article and may proceed with the filing of an action against the builder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the builder notifies the claimant in writing at least five (5) days before the stated completion date that the repair work will not be completed by the completion date, the builder shall be entitled to one (1) reasonable extension of the completion date, not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
E.  Completion of repairs. The builder shall notify the claimant when repairs have been completed. The claimant shall have ten (10) days following the completion date to have the premises inspected to verify that the repairs are complete and satisfactorily resolved the alleged defects. An association claimant who believes in good faith that the repairs made do not resolve the defects may proceed with the notice required by section 26-1310. Any other claimant may then elect to file an action under C.R.S. § 13-20-803.5 or any other applicable statute or court rule. 
(Ord. No. 1580 , § 1, 8-24-15) 
Sec. 26-1307. - Warranty of repairs. 
    The repair work performed by the builder shall be warranted against material defects in design or construction for a period of two (2) years, which warranty shall be in addition to any express warranties on the original work 
(Ord. No. 1580 , § 1, 8-24-15) 
Sec. 26-1308. - Subsequently discovered defects. 
    Any alleged construction defect discovered after repairs have been completed shall be subject to the same requirements of this article if the builder did not have notice or an opportunity to repair the particular defect. 
(Ord. No. 1580 , § 1, 8-24-15) 
Sec. 26-1309. - Alternative dispute resolution provisions. 
    Nothing in this article shall preclude the claimant and builder from reaching a mutual agreement regarding alternative dispute resolutions. If a provision found in the declaration, bylaws or rules and regulations of a condominium development or common interest community requires that construction defect claims be submitted to mediation or arbitration, that requirement constitutes a commitment on the part of the unit owners and the association upon which a developer, contractor, architect, builder or other person involved in the construction of the community is entitled to rely. Consequently, a subsequent amendment to the declaration, bylaws or rules and regulations that removes or amends the mediation or arbitration requirement shall not be effective with regard to any construction defect claim that is based on an alleged act or omission that predates that amendment. 
(Ord. No. 1580 , § 1, 8-24-15) 
Sec. 26-1310. - Association obligation to inform homeowners. 
    Homeowners are entitled to be kept informed by boards of homeowners associations of the board's consideration of actions regarding construction defects and to have meaningful input and a right to make a considered judgment and give (or withhold) consent to institute an action asserting one (1) or more construction defects. The association board must do each of the following: 
A.  At least sixty (60) days before filing any action under C.R.S. § 13-20-803.5, or on any other statute or court rule, an association claimant must mail or deliver written notice to each homeowner at the homeowner's last known address. 
B.  The notice must be signed by a person other than, and not employed or otherwise affiliated with, the attorney or law firm that represents or will represent the association in the construction defects claim. 
C.  The notice required by this section must contain the following information: 
1.  The nature of the action and the relief sought; 
2.  The amount of expenses and fees the board anticipates will be incurred, directly or indirectly, in prosecuting the action, including attorney fees, consultant fees, expert witness fees and court costs, whether incurred by the association directly or for which it may be liable if it is not the prevailing party or if it does not proceed with the action; 
3.  The estimated cost of repairing the defect, or if the defect is not repaired, the estimated reduction in value of the unit; 
4.  The estimated impact on the marketability of units that are not the subject of the action, including any impact on the ability of the owners to refinance their property during and after the action; 
5.  The manner in which the association proposes to fund the cost of the action, including any proposed special assessments or the use of any revenues; 
6.  The anticipated duration of the action and the likelihood of success; 
7.  Whether the builder has offered to make any repairs and, if so, whether the builder has made repairs; and 
8.  The steps taken by the builder, if any, in accordance with this article to address the alleged defect, including any acknowledgement, inspection, election to repair or repairs. 
D.  The association claimant may not commence the action unless the board obtains the written consent of homeowners holding at least a majority of the total voting rights in the association after giving the notice required by this section. In the event the association governs units in more than a single building, the written consent required by this section shall be a majority of the units with voting rights only in the building or buildings in which the construction defect is alleged to be present. Homeowners may vote either directly or through a proxy directed in writing by the homeowner and confirmed in writing by the proxy. Such consent must be obtained within sixty (60) days after such notice is provided, otherwise the owners shall be deemed to have declined to provide their informed consent to such action.
