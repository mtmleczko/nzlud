PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Siloam Springs, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of directors. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Publisher's notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David G. Poucher, Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Peggy Woody, City Clerk and Mr. Steve Stitt, City Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(c)  Inventory. All service vehicles, together with on vehicle tools, materials and supplies, will be inventoried monthly under the supervision of the appropriate department head or the administrator. The assigned driver of the vehicle shall be accountable for all tools assigned to his vehicle and will keep records of materials, equipment and supplies drawn and used. 
(d)  Operation regulations. City employees are expected to operate vehicles in accordance with all traffic laws and rules of the road.

The administrator shall issue written instructions outlining procedures for compliance with this chapter in accordance with the following minimum requirements: 
(1)  Small expenditure limitation. Expenditures for day-to-day supplies and operational needs, will be effected through utilization of prudent and practical selectivity of best price sources, according to procedures provided by written administrative policy. The limitation for such expenditures from the effective date of this ordinance through 2014 shall be $10,000.00, and thereafter shall be adjusted annually in accordance with the All Items Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers (CPI-U), South Region, for the preceding 12 months, rounded to the nearest $1,000.00.

a.  For goods and services in an amount less than or equal to ten percent of the small expenditure limitation may be purchased in the manner determined to be in the best interest of the city, at the discretion of the department director. It is recommended and expected that a price comparison will be made in most circumstances. If, however, the department director determines that such comparison is not feasible, or that the public interest would be served by selection based on factors other than price, multiple quotes shall not be required. All such purchases are subject to review by the city administrator. Upon request, it shall be the responsibility of the department director to provide justification for invoking this section. 
b.  For goods and services less than or equal to the small expenditure limitation, the following purchases are exempt from comparative price requirements, subject to review by the city administrator:

9.  Services of visiting speakers, lecturers, and performing artists; 
10.  Taxes; 
11.  Travel expense items, such as room, board and transportation charges;

(2)  Intermediate expenditure limitation. All expenditures by the city for public purposes, wherein the expenditure therefor is between the small expenditure limitation and the competitive bid requirement shall be made only after solicitation of comparable written price quotations from at least three separate suppliers. Expenditures of less than the competitive bid requirement from state bid sources shall be exempt from this provision. 
(3)  Expenditures in excess of $30.000.00. Each expenditure exceeding $30,000.00, shall be specifically listed in the city administrator's written report presented at the next regular meeting of the board of directors.

Sec. 2-222. - Large expenditures. 
    Where the amount of expenditure exceeds the bid limitation as established by section 2-221 the city administrator shall invite competitive sealed bids thereon by (optional) advertisement in any newspaper of general circulation in an area of resource which will supply the need, and by (mandatory) advertisement in any locally-published newspaper, at least once 30 or more days prior to an established date on which no further bids shall be accepted. Other prospective bidders which may not have access to local newspapers may be advised by mail of the specifications and solicitation for bids. Bids received pursuant to such solicitations shall be opened and read at the date and time established for such opening in the presence of the appropriate departmental director or their designee. The city administrator shall have exclusive power to award the bid to the lowest responsible bidder, after approval of the city board of directors. The expenditure shall be awarded on the basis of lowest responsible bidder, provided, however, that the city administrator may reject any and all such bids or waive non-prejudicial irregularities. Except for emergencies as provided in subsection 2-223(b), and change orders within the limits as provided in subsection 2-223(c), no bid contract expenditure approved by the board of directors shall be increased without further approval of the board; provided, however, that the estimated total cost of unit-price contracts may be exceeded without prior board approval unless the scope of the work, or the price per unit, is increased. By written report presented at the next regular meeting of the board of directors, the administrator shall report the amount by which any unit-price contract has exceeded the bid estimate.

(b)  Emergency expenditures. Upon a failure of existing facilities, the immediate repair or replacement of which must be accomplished to avoid threat to the health, peace or safety of citizens of the city, the city administrator is authorized and responsible to effect emergency repairs by the most expeditious available means. Such instances will be exempt from the competitive bid process. The city administrator will submit a full written report of such emergency procedures to the city board of directors and certify the need for effecting such procedure, justifying both method and cost in effecting emergency repair, at the next regular meeting of the board. 
(c)  Change orders. Change orders that do not exceed five percent of the approved project amount and are within the spending authority of the city administrator shall not require board of directors' approval. However, all change orders over and above the amount specified by subsection 2-221(3) of this Code shall be reported in the administrator's written report presented at the next regular meeting of the board of directors. 
(Ord. No. 12-12, § I, 10-2-2012; Ord. No. 14-19, § I, 8-19-2014) 
Sec. 2-224. - Approval of payment. 
(a)  The city administrator may approve for payment out of any funds appropriated for that purpose, or disapprove any bills, debts or liabilities asserted as claims against the city, when funds on hand are adequate to pay such bills, debts or liabilities. 
(b)  Funds shall be deemed appropriated as follows: 
(1)  When the expenditure is specified in a budget currently approved by the board of directors, or is otherwise specifically approved by vote of the board of directors; or 
(2)  For emergency expenditures less than $30,000.00, when the payment is stated by writing of the city administrator at a regular meeting of the board; provided, however, that the budget shall thereafter be amended to reflect the expense, and shall remain a balanced budget.

(a)  Pursuant to the authority of A.C.A. 21-9-302, the city administrator is authorized to hear all tort claims against the city, and to deny or settle such claims as he determines to be in the city's best interest, subject to the following: Any settlement exceeding the sum of $15,000.00 to any one person or entity shall be reported to the board of directors at the next regular meeting.

(3)  For any landscaping standard that cannot be attained due to physical hardships existing on the lot, the developer may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance. The administrator or his designee shall issue an opinion on the merits of the hardship for any variance within this section of the Municipal Code. 
(e)  Incentives. Any combination of incentives, or parking reduction assigned by the permitting authority, shall not total more than a 40 percent reduction of the otherwise required parking spaces. Similarly, cumulative development permit fee reductions shall not exceed 25 percent of the total fee. A combination of parking space and fee reductions may be applied on a single project as reasonably determined by the city administrator or his designee. 
(1)  If the developer adds additional shrubs to the perimeter or front landscaping area, the developer may reduce parking requirements by one parking space for every ten shrubs added or may reduce the development permit application fee by five percent for each additional ten shrubs added. 
(2)  If the developer adds additional islands to the interior lot area, the developer may reduce parking requirements by one parking space per added island or may reduce the development permit application fee by two percent for each additional island added. Islands must meet minimum size requirements found in section 53-11(e)(4)b. of this chapter.

The building height, as applied through this incentive, shall not exceed 45 feet and the front setback, as applied through this incentive, shall never be decreased to less than 30 feet from the front property line. 
(6)  If the developer uses 50 percent native flowers and/or grasses (listed in Table 3) within the total landscaping provided, the developer may reduce the total parking required, or may reduce the development permit application fee, by a factor of ten percent. The parking reduction may exceed ten percent if the same factor is applied for an additional ten percent of native flowers or grasses. For example, 60 percent of native flowers and/or grasses would allow for a 20 percent parking reduction. 
(7)  Parking reduction incentives within subsection (e), above, may be combined with otherwise granted parking reductions through the zoning code, provided that the accumulative reduction applied does not exceed 40 percent of the total required parking. 
(f)  Review and inspection process.

Sec. 54-35. - Variance development permit. 
(a)  Process. No variance development permit shall be issued except upon authorization by the board of adjustment, which shall be constituted of the planning commission members. Except as the board may otherwise provide, it shall be governed by procedures adopted by the planning commission. 
(b)  Standards. As the board of adjustment, the planning commission shall authorize a variance development permit only when the standards decreed by state statute are met, and shall apply those statutory terms as follows: 
(1)  The board's determination of whether there is "undue hardship unique to the property" should reflect whether, and the degree to which, the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that: 
a.  The need for the variance arises from a uniqueness of the property not frequently occurring in the zone; and that 
b.  The uniqueness of the property was not caused, allowed, or known prior to purchase, by the owner, or has existed for a minimum of 15 years. 
c.  The identified hardship relates to a measurable aspect of the property and is not financial in nature. 
d.  The variance granted is the minimum necessary to alleviate such practical difficulties or the identified undue hardship upon the owner of the property. 
(2)  The board's determination of whether approval of the development permit would be "in keeping with the spirit and intent of the Code" shall reflect whether, and the degree to which, the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the proposed variance: 
a.  Will not substantially damage any property value in the neighborhood; 
b.  Will be compatible with and respect the context of its location and the character of the surrounding existing neighborhoods; 
c.  Will not substantially impair the neighborhood's quality of life, including without limitation, sound and traffic levels, pedestrian and vehicular access, visual presentment, and character; 
d.  Will not, by the nature of the variance, tend to burden the present or future use of neighboring properties in accordance with current zoning standards; and 
e.  Is mitigated in part by permanent characteristics of the lot or adjacent uses of land including, without limitation, natural features or permanent easements. 
(c)  Conditions. 
(1)  The board of adjustment may adopt or create special conditions to ensure that a variance development permit allowing a variance from land regulations, as a material condition essential to any authorization it confers to any lot or construction, be located and designed in a manner that complies with the following: 
a.  Provides safe and convenient traffic flow; 
b.  Maximizes the effectiveness of all drainage patterns and facilities; and 
c.  Remains compatible with neighborhood architecture and layout, and with city growth and planning. 
(2)  No variance shall be granted that permits the land to be used in such a manner as to create a noxious condition, or a condition that threatens public health, safety, or welfare, or constitutes a nuisance, or disturbs the public peace. 
(3)  The applicant's failure to fully perform the conditions shall render the development permit void and invalid and of no further effect, and the use and/or structure shall immediately be conformed to the applicable regular zoning standards of this Code without any period of nonconformity. 
(d)  Notice. Notice of the application for a variance development permit shall be as follows: 
(1)  By posting no less than 30 days prior to the board of adjustment review and maintaining until final disposition, a notice sign of the development permit application that consists of the time, place and date of review by the board of adjustment, or a telephone number and/or web address where the time, place and date of the hearing may be obtained, and 
(2)  By publishing once and by mailing notice of: 
a.  The subject of the application, including property address and proposed variance, and of 
b.  The place and date of review by the board of adjustment, which notices shall precede the review date by not less than 15, nor more than 30 days.

c.  Will be compatible with and respect the context of its location and the character of the surrounding existing neighborhoods;

(2)  The applicant's failure to fully perform the conditions shall render the development permit void and invalid and of no further effect, and the use shall immediately be conformed to the applicable regular zoning standards of this Code without any period of nonconformity. 
(3)  Without limitation, the conditions may restrict hours or manner of use, and may provide for expiration of the development permit at a time certain. 
(d)  Notice. Notice of the application for the special use development permit shall be as follows: 
(1)  By posting no less than 30 days prior to the planning commission's scheduled review and maintaining until final disposition, a notice sign of the development permit application that displays the time, place and date of the planning commission advisory review, or a telephone number and/or web address where the time, place and date of the hearing may be obtained.

b.  When fairness requires, the board may remand an application for further presentment to the planning commission. 
(f)  Expiration. Unless earlier invalidated as provided by this Municipal Code, the special use development permit shall remain indefinitely authorized through the specific land use proposed under the original application, and shall not expire as long as the authorized special use is operated in the same manner as initially authorized by the board of directors and said special use is commenced within 365 days after the board of directors' authorization.

ARTICLE I. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 66-1. - Introduction. 
(a)  General. These regulations shall be known as the Siloam Springs Property Maintenance and Nuisance Abatement Code and may be referred to herein as "the code" or "this code". These regulations are intended to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises within the City of Siloam Springs, Arkansas. 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of this code shall apply to all residential and nonresidential structures and all premises within the City of Siloam Springs, Arkansas and constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures, equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation, protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards, and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators and occupants; the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for administration, enforcement and penalties. Structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required herein, after appropriate notification by the city. Repairs, alterations, additions to and change of occupancy in existing buildings shall comply with the Arkansas State Fire Prevention Code. Where different standards or requirements are imposed by this code, or Siloam Springs Municipal Code, the most restrictive standard or requirement shall govern. 
(c)  Historic buildings, structures and districts. Existing buildings or structures designated by the city, the State of Arkansas, or the United States government to be historic or within a designated historic district shall be exempted from the literal requirements of such provisions of this code if it is determined by the city administrator such literal requirement infringes upon the historic nature of the building or structure. However, no exemption may be allowed unless the buildings or structures are judged by the senior code enforcement officer to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or premises was constructed, altered or required shall be maintained in good working order. No occupant shall cause any required service, facility, equipment or utility to be removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except for temporary interruptions necessitated by repairs or alterations. The requirements of this code are not intended to provide the basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings, structures and premises. 
(e)  Requirements not covered by code. Requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the senior code enforcement officer. Such decisions are considered to be administrative determinations subject to appeal as provided by section 66-7. No citations may be issued based upon an administrative decision under this subsection until interested parties have been informed about the decision and been afforded an opportunity to appeal, code enforcement officers shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a file of all administrative rules made pursuant to this subsection which shall be available for copy and inspection by the public. 
(f)  Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of the most current adopted Arkansas Fire Prevention Code, Arkansas Energy Code, Arkansas Fuel Gas Code, Arkansas Mechanical Code, Arkansas Plumbing Code and NFPA 70. Nothing in this code shall be construed to cancel, modify or set aside any provision of the Siloam Springs Municipal Code. 
(g)  Existing remedies. The provisions in this code shall not be construed to abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure that is dangerous, unsafe and insanitary.

Sec. 66-2. - Code enforcement officers. 
(a)  General. This code shall be enforced by all code enforcement officers of the city. For the purposes of this code, a code enforcement officer shall be defined as any city employee who has been authorized to uphold the ordinances of the city and laws of the State of Arkansas related to property uses, maintenance, nuisances, inspections, issuances of building permits, certifications and licensing etc., within the municipal boundaries of the city. This code may also be enforced by any and all duly sworn law enforcement officers of the police department. 
(b)  Identification. All code enforcement officers shall carry proper identification and present the same upon request when performing duties under this code. 
(c)  Rule-making authority. The city administrator shall have authority as necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate administrative and procedural rules and to interpret and implement the provisions of this code in a manner consistent with the intent thereof. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided for in this code, or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public safety. Rules and interpretations made pursuant to this subsection are considered to be administrative determinations subject to appeal as provided by section 66-7. No citations may be issued based upon a rule or interpretation under this subsection until interested parties have been informed about the decision and been afforded an opportunity to appeal. The city administrator shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a file of all administrative rules made pursuant to this subsection which shall be available for copy and inspection by the public. 
(d)  Modifications. Whenever the senior code enforcement officer identifies practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this code, the city administrator shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the city administrator shall first make written findings that a special condition or circumstance exists such that the strict letter of this code is impractical and the modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the code enforcement division's files. 
(Ord. No. 16-21, § I, 12-20-2016) 
Sec. 66-3. - Inspections.

If such structure or premises is occupied the code enforcement officer shall present credentials to the occupant and request entry. If such structure or premises is unoccupied, the code enforcement officer shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner, owner's authorized agent or other person having charge or control of the structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the code enforcement officer shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry. 
(b)  Inspections. The code enforcement officer shall make all of the required inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. Reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the responsible individual. The code enforcement officer is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise, subject to the approval of the city administrator. 
(c)  Required testing. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the senior code enforcement officer shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense to the jurisdiction. Reports of tests shall be recorded and entered in the department files. 
(d)  Material and equipment reuse. Materials, equipment and devices shall not be reused unless a code enforcement officer finds that such elements are in good repair or have been reconditioned and tested when necessary, placed in good and proper working condition and approved.

An accurate account of all costs incurred shall be itemized and filed with the city administrator or the administrator's designee. 
(3)  The city administrator or the administrator's designee shall mail a statement to the person involved showing total costs assessed against them, being due and payable upon receipt. If such statement has not been paid in full or acceptable payment arrangement made within 30 days, the city administrator or the designee shall certify the costs to the city attorney, who will initiate appropriate civil action, pursuant to A.C.A. § 14-54-903, claiming a lien on property included. 
(4)  The lien provided for above may be enforced in accordance with law. The amount determined by the board of directors, plus ten percent penalty for collection, will be certified to the county tax collector for placement on the records as delinquent taxes and collected accordingly. 
(5)  In cases where circumstances appear to deem it impractical to summarily abate, the city may bring civil action for abatement of the nuisance. 
(b)  Enforcement. The administrator is charged with the responsibility to enforce, through the administrator's designated agents, all provisions of this article. Any city official may report the existence of or alleged existence of a nuisance to the administrator or the designated agents for enforcement action. The code enforcement officers, the building official, or other persons designated by the administrator, or any police officer is authorized to issue notice and/or subsequent citation for violation of any part of this article. 
(c)  Remedies for specific nuisances. 
(1)  Uncut weeds, grass and unsanitary articles. All property owners and occupants within the municipal boundaries of the city are required to cut weeds and grass when greater than nine inches in height, remove garbage, rubbish and other unsanitary articles and things from their property, and to eliminate, fill up, or remove stagnant pools of water or any other unsanitary thing, place or condition which might become a breeding place for mosquitoes, flies and germs harmful to the health of the community. For specific requirements related to the required maintenance of grass and weeds, refer to section 66-31(d). 
(A)  Authorized abatement. If the owner of any lot or other real property within the city shall neglect or refuse to remove, abate or eliminate any condition as may be provided for under section 66-84(c)(1), after having been given a notice of violation with a minimum of seven days' notice in writing to do so by a code enforcement officer, the city is hereby authorized to take such action is necessary to correct the condition, including but not limited to entering upon the property and having such weeds, rank grass or other vegetation cut and removed, or eliminating any unsanitary and unsightly condition, or causing necessary repairs to be made and charging the cost thereof to the owner of such premises, which shall constitute a lien thereon. The abovementioned notice shall be calculated by counting the first day of the notice period as the day after written notice is given to the owner, by counting every calendar day, including weekends and holidays, and by establishing the deadline to take the above required actions as 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the notice period. The city reserves the right to secure a lien for its costs, including a priority clean-up lien pursuant to A.C.A § 14-54-903. 
(B)  Special notice rules for weed lots. For purposes of this section, a "weed lot" is a previously platted and subdivided lot that is vacant or upon which an unsafe and vacant structure is located and that contains debris, rubbish, or grass contrary to this code. Due to the continual growth cycle of vegetation on weed lots, continuous abatement is often necessary. Thus the minimum seven-day notice of violation described in subsection (c)(1)(A) above shall be issued with the following additional statement, "Work to abate this nuisance will not be complete until the end of the growing season and no additional notices will be issued." No additional notice of violation need be given unless and until the growing season concludes and further abatement is necessary. 
(C)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the application of the provisions of this subsection: 
1.  Agricultural lands under cultivation; 
2.  Construction under timely and efficient progression. 
(2)  Inoperable or wrecked motor vehicles, trailers, and any parts thereof. The accumulation of inoperable or wrecked motor vehicles and inoperable or wrecked trailers in the city is degrading to the environment, property values, and the aesthetic beauty of the city. Thus, the only location outside of a completely enclosed structure where an inoperable or wrecked motor vehicle, an inoperable or wrecked trailer, or any parts thereof, may be parked, kept, or stored within the city is in an approved storage area on property that is properly zoned and permitted for that purpose. (Please refer to chapter 102, zoning of the Municipal Code.) The parking, keeping, or storing of inoperable or wrecked motor vehicles, inoperable or wrecked trailers, or any parts thereof, at any other location, or unauthorized area thereon, in the city is declared to be a nuisance and may be cited for violation of section 66-31(h) and, if necessary, abated as provided in subsections (c)(2)(C) and (c)(2)(D), below. 
(A)  Presumption of inoperability. A vehicle shall be deemed inoperable when two or more of the following conditions exist: 
1.  One or more tires are flat. 
2.  One or more wheels are missing. 
3.  The hood or trunk is raised or missing and has appeared to remain so for more than three days. 
4.  Weeds or grass have grown up around the vehicle. 
5.  The engine is missing. 
6.  The vehicle has no current vehicle tags or registration. 
7.  The door or doors, fender or fenders are removed or missing. 
8.  The front or rear windshield is broken, removed or missing, or the side windows are broken or removed or missing. 
(B)  Presumption of inoperability. A trailer, as defined in section 66-9 shall be deemed inoperable when two or more of the following conditions exist: 
1.  One or more tires are flat. 
2.  One or more wheels are missing. 
3.  Weeds or grass have grown up around the vehicle. 
4.  The trailer has no current tags or registration. 
5.  Hitch is missing. 
6.  The structure or frame is severely damaged. 
7.  Flooring is missing. 
(C)  Removal of inoperable or wrecked motor vehicles, inoperable or wrecked trailers, any parts thereof near public streets. If an owner or occupant of property within the city shall neglect or refuse to remove an inoperable or wrecked motor vehicle, inoperable or wrecked trailer, or any parts thereof that are parked, kept or stored near a public street without proper authority, a code enforcement officer may cause the removal of the motor vehicle, trailer, or parts thereof, provided that a notice of violation is affixed to the vehicle, trailer, or parts for a period of no less than three days which shall state that the vehicle, trailer, or parts are a nuisance and order the property owner, occupant, or whoever has an interest in the vehicle, trailer, or parts to remove them from the property. If the vehicle, trailer, or parts are found on private property with one or more occupiable structures, a copy of the notice shall additionally be placed on one of the structures. For purposes of this section, a vehicle, trailer, or parts thereof shall be deemed "near" a public street if it can be seen with the unaided eye from a public street. 
(D)  Removal of other inoperable or wrecked motor vehicles, inoperable or wrecked trailers or parts thereof. If an owner or occupant of property within the city shall neglect or refuse to remove an inoperable or wrecked motor vehicle, inoperable or wrecked trailers or parts thereof that are parked, kept or stored without proper authority but away from public streets, a code enforcement officer may cause the removal of the motor vehicle, trailer, or parts provided that a notice of violation is affixed to the vehicle, trailer, or parts for a period of no less than 30 days which shall state that the vehicle, trailer, or parts are a nuisance and order the property owner, occupant, or whoever has an interest in the vehicle, trailer, or parts to remove them from the property. If the vehicle, trailer, or parts are found on private property with one or more occupiable structures, a copy of the notice shall additionally be placed on one of the structures. 
(E)  Exemption. As provided for in section 66-31(h). 
(3)  Impediments to city streets, easements, or rights-of-way. The city owns property rights throughout the jurisdiction of this code which are necessary to the efficient flow of traffic, storm water, utility service, and the like. Impediments to these property rights are declared to be a public nuisance as they reduce the public benefit of public property and can endanger the health and welfare of the citizens who use and depend upon these property rights. Code enforcement officers shall have the authority to order the immediate removal of any impediment to the use of public streets, sidewalks, drains, ditches, utilities, easements, or other rights-of-way. If the apparent owner of the impediment is not known, available, or willing to remove the impediment, a code enforcement officer may cause the same to be removed. Any person who is aggrieved by the actions of a code enforcement officer under this subsection may appeal the same pursuant to section 66-7. 
(A)  Property deemed abandoned. Any property seized by the city pursuant to subsection (c)(3) shall be deemed abandoned after 30 days and properly disposed of by the senior code enforcement officer. 
(4)  Nuisance structures. Any building or other structure which is in such a dilapidated condition that it is unsafe or unfit for human habitation, or kept in such an unsanitary condition that it is a menace to the health or safety of people residing in the vicinity thereof, or presents a more than ordinarily dangerous fire hazard in the vicinity where it is located shall constitute a nuisance. 
(A)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following terms are defined as follows: 
1.  Unsafe structures.

2.  Unfit structure for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for human occupancy whenever the code enforcement officer finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public. 
3.  Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law. 
(B)  Vacating of unfit or unsafe structures and utility services.

On the eighth day after said notice the code enforcement division shall notify all utilities to discontinue services to the dwelling or dwelling unit. After utilities services are cutoff no further services shall be made available until the appropriate construction permits are obtained or until the code enforcement division notifies utilities that services may be provided to the dwelling or dwelling unit. 
1.  Placarding. Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply with the notice of violation for a nuisance structure or equipment within the time given, the code enforcement officer shall then post on the premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the word "nuisance" and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard. 
2.  Placard removal. The code officer shall remove the placard referred to in this subsection whenever the defect or defects upon which the placarding actions were based have been eliminated.

2.  If the landowner elects to purchase a second professional appraisal, and thereafter to present an offer of sale to the city, and where the city's time constraints (as determined by the city administrator) allow, the city administrator may present the offer to the board of directors, which shall accept or reject the offer, or offer further directions to the city administrator. 
3.  If the parties reach agreement for sale, the city administrator shall have discretion, upon request of the land owner, to deliver any portion of the value of the property interest through "in kind" city services. The value of the services shall be specified by writing.

a.  For purposes of residential lawn and garden watering, in season, the quantity of wastewater used for billing purposes will be reduced on customer statements received in June, July, August, September and October. The base quantity for each of these billing periods will be established by computing the customer's average use over the preceding seven months' water usage. If a seven-month average usage figure has not been established, an average will be computed on the number of bedrooms within a home as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. 
b.  Irrigation adjustments will be reflected only on statements for the months set forth in subsection (1)a. of this section; statements may be billed on an actual water usage basis. 
(2)  Sewer customers not on the city's water system. 
a.  Residential customers who have their own water supply will be considered as average customers dependent upon the number of bedrooms in the residence, utilizing the following schedule: 
Number of Bedrooms Base-Quantity 
(gallons) 1  3,000 2  7,000 3 11,000 4 20,000 5 30,000  
b.  Industrial customers who have their own water supply may, at their option and expense, have a sewer meter installed and the rate charged shall be based upon quantity discharged into the sewer system. 
c.  Industrial customers who use a significant amount of water during their manufacturing process may, at their option and expense, have a sewer meter installed and the rate charged shall be based upon the quantity discharged into the sewer system.

Secs. 98-328, 98-329. - Reserved. 
Sec. 98-330. - User fees and charges. 
(a)  Rate schedule. The user rates shown in Exhibit A are reasonable and necessary, and shall be paid by users (any person or legal entity) contributing wastewater to the city's collection and treatment system. The proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of operating and maintaining, including replacement (OM&R), the public wastewater treatment works, and for paying debt service expenses incurred on behalf of the public sanitary sewer system. 
("Replacement" shall include expenses of obtaining and installing equipment, accessories or appurtenances during the useful life of the treatment works, as useful or necessary to maintain the capacity and performance for which they were designed and constructed.) 
All users of the municipally owned wastewater treatment system shall pay a fee as shown on Exhibit A per 1,000 gallons of metered water consumption, for OM&R. In the case of users not on a metered basis, the utility superintendent shall establish water consumption based on a comparison of the nonmetered user with a metered user of similar class. Example: a nonmetered family of four will be compared to a typical family of four with a water meter to establish water consumption. 
User charge methodology: 
Total annual OM&R cost ($/1,000 gal.)= Total annual OM&amp / R $;(No. of 1,000 gal. sold annually) 
(b)  Excessive strength charges. When the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or suspended solids in wastewater contributed to the city sewer system by any user exceeds the concentrations shown below, or when pollutant concentrations within the wastewater exceed concentrations in average domestic sewage, a surcharge shall be added to the basic charge. This surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Suspended solids. Five percent of the user's (pre-surcharge) sewage charge for the month, for each 25 ppm (or portion thereof) of suspended solids in excess of 305 ppm. 
(2)  Biochemical oxygen demand. Five percent of the user's (pre-surcharge) sewage charge for the month, for each 25 ppm (or portion thereof) of biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 375 ppm. 
(c)  Extraneous flow charges. The costs of operation and maintenance for all flows not directly attributable to users (such as infiltration/inflow) shall be distributed among users on the same basis as operation and maintenance charges. 
(d)  Toxic pollutants charges. Each user that discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the treatment works shall pay for such increased costs. 
(e)  Debt service. Each user shall pay a lawful share of debt costs and expenses properly incurred on behalf of the city sanitary sewage system, as shown on Exhibit A. 
(f)  Total user charge. Minimum bill per user = OM&R for 1,000 gal. + Debt service + extraneous flow charge + excessive strength charge (if any) + toxic pollutant charge (if any). 
(g)  Billing. Users on metered water service will be billed on the same notice as water charges and the sewer charge will be designated as a separate entry. Users of the wastewater system not on metered water service will be billed monthly for wastewater service at the rate established by the utility. 
If the user waives the opportunity to be heard, or does not prevail in disputing all charges due, the water and/or wastewater services will be discontinued until such bill is paid. 
(h)  Records. A financial management system shall be established and maintained by the city administrator that documents compliance with federal regulations pertaining to the revolving loan. The system will account for all revenues generated and expenditures for operation and maintenance and replacement. 
(i)  Federal preemption. The fees and charges here enacted and shown on Exhibit A shall supersede and replace any terms or conditions of agreement between the city and any sewer system users that are inconsistent with applicable federal regulations.

(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the city administrator, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 98-621 of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 98-617, 98-619, and 98-620 of this ordinance. 
(b)  Users are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city administrator, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, an authorized representative of the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 98-627. - Sample collection. 
(a)  For reports required pursuant to sections 98-619 and 98-620, the city shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city administrator, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 410 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in appored[approved] EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city administrator, as appropriate. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c)  For reports required pursuant to sections 98-617 and 98-619, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and degrease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum.

(1)  A compliance order may be issued to direct the user to come into compliance within a specified time. Such order may establish compliance schedules setting forth increments of progress in the form of dates for activities necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement. 
(2)  A cease and desist order may be issued to require the user to cease and desist all violations immediately. A cease and desist order may also direct the user to immediately comply with all requirements and take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continued or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge of wastewater. 
(3)  A consent order may also be entered by the city after a user has agreed to a compliance schedule and any stipulated fines imposed by the city. A consent order will include specific action to be taken by the user to remedy the noncompliance within the time specified. Such consent order shall not be effective unless and until signed by the mayor. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 12-05, § 11(11.4), 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 98-765. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The city administrator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city administrator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 11.6 of this ordinance are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 98-762 or 98-766 of this ordinance. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 12-05, § 11(11.5), 6-19-2012)

    Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to appear before the board of directors to show cause under section 98-762 of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city administrator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 12-05, § 11(11.6), 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 98-767. - Appeal to board of directors. 
    Any enforcement action taken by the city or its authorized representative, but not having been decided upon by the board of directors, or any decision by the city administrator to deny permit issuance, shall be appealable to the board of directors by filing a written notice of appeal stating the basis for the appeal within 30 days of being notified of the enforcement action or decision to deny permit issuance. The board of directors may dismiss groundless or frivolous appeals summarily. The board of directors may convene a hearing on the appeal.

Sec. 98-816. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the city administrator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 12-05, § 13(13.1), 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 98-817. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 98-503(a) of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in subsection 98-503(b)(3) through (7) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 12-05, § 13(13.2), 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 98-818. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city administrator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city administrator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city administrator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The city administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city administrator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

"a" is the fair market value of the property (structure + lot). (Fair market value is the sale price to the highest and best bidder in an arms-length transaction, or shall be established by expert opinion solicited by the City.) 
"b" is the total square foot of the structure, both heated and cooled area. 
"c" is the encroachment area (square feet) occupied by the structure. 
(3)  Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy in compliance with the above-listed conditions, the Administrator shall, by writing, certify that the structure is a lawful use of land that is subject to the rights and regulations attending nonconforming uses permitted by this chapter, which certification may be filed of record by the owner.

(5)  Any structure which is sited in violation of setback regulations provided in this Code, for which a certificate of occupancy was inadvertently issued by the City prior to the date of enactment of this ordinance, shall be deemed a lawful use of land that is subject to the rights and regulations attending nonconforming uses that are permitted by this chapter. 
(6)  All penalty fees received by the City shall be placed into the general fund of the City. 
(7)  Any certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this section shall be void ab initio, and of no force or effect, upon a final judicial determination that any provision of this section (including, without limitation, the civil penalty prescribed in subsection (1)b. above) is invalid.
