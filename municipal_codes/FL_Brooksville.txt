PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Brooksville, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented through November 2, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Sherry Albritton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. David La Croix, City Attorney and Ms. Karen Phillips, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-2. - Policy regarding the conduct of quasi-judicial hearings and the disclosure of ex parte communications. 
    Adoption of new policy. The City Council of the City of Brooksville hereby adopts the following policy regarding the conduct of quasi-judicial hearings and the disclosure of ex parte communications, which policy shall govern all quasi-judicial hearings conducted by any board, committee, agency or commission of the City of Brooksville, in accordance with Florida Statute, Sec. 286.0115: 
(a)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated below, unless the context in which such word or phrase is used clearly indicates that another meaning is intended: 
(1)  Local public official: Any elected or appointed public official holding a municipal office who recommends or takes quasi-judicial action as a member of a board or commission. Local public officials include, but are not necessarily limited to any member of the city council, the city's planning and zoning commission, the city's firefighters pension trust fund board of trustees, the city's police officers pension trust fund board of trustees, any ad hoc committee or board created by the city council to decide any quasi-judicial matter, and any city hearing officer or special master. 
(2)  Ex parte communication: Any communication, written, oral or by way of any electronic or other medium or process, to a local public official regarding any quasi-judicial matter which is made outside of an advertised hearing on such matter. 
(3)  Quasi-judicial matter: Any matter with regard to which an individual local public official or a board, commission or committee of local public officials is required to ascertain facts based on evidence presented at an advertised hearing and draw conclusions from such facts to determine the personal or property rights of any party, including, but not limited to, re-zonings; applications for special exceptions, variances, or planned development project approvals; disciplinary actions and license or permit revocation actions; appeals of administrative decisions; and appeals of quasi-judicial decisions. 
(b)  Application. 
(1)  This section shall apply to all quasi-judicial proceedings in which public hearings are required or proceedings in which a property right is at issue. However, this section shall specifically exclude any proceedings or hearings in relation to the consideration of the comprehensive plan evaluation and appraisal report or amendments to the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Communications with local public officials; procedure for disclosure of ex parte communications. 
(1)  Communications permitted. Any person not otherwise prohibited by statute, charter provision or ordinance may discuss with any local public official the merits of any quasi-judicial matter on which action may be taken by any such local public official, or by any board, commission or committee on which the local public official is a member. Any presumption of prejudice arising from such ex parte communications shall be removed and declared non-existent if all of the requirements of this section are followed as to any ex parte communication: 
a.  The substance of any ex parte communication with a local public official which relates to a quasi-judicial matter pending before the official shall not be presumed prejudicial to the outcome of the matter if the subject matter of the communication and the identity of the person, group or entity with whom the communication took place is disclosed and made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
b.  A local public official may read a written communication from any person or source regarding a pending quasi-judicial matter. However, such written communication that relates to a quasi-judicial action pending before a local public official shall not be presumed prejudicial to the outcome of the matter, if such written communication shall be made part of the record before final action on the matter. 
c.  Local public officials may conduct investigations and site visits and may receive expert opinions regarding quasi-judicial action pending before the local public official. Such activities shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action taken if the existence of the investigation, site visit or expert opinion is made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(2)  Disclosure. In order for the presumption of any prejudice resulting from ex parte communications in quasi judicial matters to be removed and declared non-existent, disclosure of the ex parte communications made pursuant to sub-subsections (c)(1)a., (c)(1)b., and (c)(1)c., above, must be made before or during the public meeting at which a vote is taken on such quasi-judicial matters, so that persons who have opinions contrary to those expressed in the ex parte communication are given a reasonable opportunity to refute or respond to the communication. 
(3)  Noncompliance. Failure of any local public official to comply with this section does not subject said local public official to a violation of Florida Statutes, Chapter 112, Part III, Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees. 
(d)  Local government land use matters. 
(1)  Prior to the beginning of a hearing on any quasi-judicial proceeding involving local government land use matters (such as a rezoning, variance, special exception, or planned development project approval), any person may file a request to intervene in such matter as a party. The request shall set forth facts sufficient to establish that such person may be adversely affected by the decision on such matter in some manner greater than the general public. The local public official or board, commission or committee hearing such matter shall determine, prior to the start of the hearing, whether or not such person has identified a sufficient basis to intervene as a party. 
(2)  In a quasi judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person who appears before the decision making body, who is not a party, party intervenor or city employee testifying in an official capacity, shall be allowed to testify before the decision-making body, subject to control by the decision-making body, and may be requested to respond to questions from the decision-making body, but need not be sworn as a witness, is not required to be subject to cross-examination, and is not required to be qualified as an expert witness. The decision-making body shall assign weight and credibility to such testimony as it deems appropriate. Any party, party-intervener or city employee testifying in an official capacity in a quasi-judicial proceeding involving local government land use matters, upon request by another party or party-intervener, shall be sworn as a witness, shall be subject to cross-examination by other parties or party-interveners, and shall be required to be qualified as an expert witness, as appropriate. 
(3)  In a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person may not be precluded from communicating directly with a member of the decision-making body by application of ex parte communication prohibitions. Disclosure of such communications by the decision making official or by a member of the decision-making body is not required, and such nondisclosure shall not be presumed prejudicial to the decision of the decision-making body. All decisions of the decision-making body in a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters must be supported by substantial, competent evidence in the record pertinent to the proceeding, irrespective of such communications.

The community redevelopment trust fund is to exist for the duration of the community redevelopment project area programs or until legally terminated by ordinance.

(b)  The tax roll used in connection with the taxation of such property for the base year shall be the tax roll of 1998 in the county. All deposits into the community redevelopment trust fund shall begin with the incremental increases in ad valorem tax revenues received subsequent to November 1, 1998.

(1)  That amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by all taxing authorities, excluding taxing authorities that are statutorily exempt, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the community redevelopment project area; and 
(2)  That amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by all taxing authorities, excluding taxing authorities that are statutorily exempt, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable property in the community redevelopment project area, as shown upon the 1998 assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by all taxing authorities, excluding the school district. If any conflict occurs between the provisions of this article and the provisions of F.S. ch. 163, part III, concerning tax increment financing, the statutory provisions shall control and apply to this article. 
(d)  The tax increment shall be computed by using the assessed value of taxable property in the community redevelopment project area for the year 1998 as the base, and in subsequent years using the assessment value of property in the community redevelopment project area for that year as the second factor in determining the amount of tax increment in that year. 
(e)  All taxing authorities, excluding taxing authorities that are statutorily exempt, will annually appropriate to the community redevelopment trust fund the aforestated sum at the beginning of their fiscal year. The fund shall receive the tax increment above described only as, if and when such taxes may be collected by the taxing authorities. The taxing authorities' obligation to annually appropriate to the fund shall commence immediately upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and continue until all loans, advances and indebtednesses, if any, and interest thereon, incurred by the community redevelopment agency as a result of the community redevelopment project area have been paid and only to the extent that such tax increment recited above accrues.

(b)  The city will be responsible for reviewing each application it receives for building permit fee deferral/forgiveness and shall prepare a recommendation and report to the city council as to whether any incentive under this provision should be awarded to the TI applicant and, if so, at what amount or percentage. The city council, acting in their sole legislative discretion, shall make the final decision as to whether to award any incentive to the TI under this provision and, if so, the amount of any such award. 
(c)  The amount of building permit fees deferred for all eligible targeted industries in any given fiscal year shall be capped at an amount established via the annual budget process by the city council. The total amount of building permit fees deferred by the city each fiscal year shall not exceed the cap without first obtaining the approval of the city council.

(b)  The city will be responsible for reviewing each application it receives for impact fee deferral/forgiveness and shall prepare a recommendation and report to the city council as to whether any incentive under this provision should be awarded to the TI applicant and, if so, at what amount or percentage. The city council, acting in their sole legislative discretion, shall make the final decision as to whether to award any incentive to the TI under this provision and, if so, the amount of such award.

This cap shall apply to each TI and is not intended as a cumulative cap where there are two or more eligible TIs in any given year. In the event that an eligible TI has impact fees in excess of the established cap, said TI shall be required to pay to the city all impact fees calculated in excess of the cap ("non-deferred impact fees") at the time of building permitting. As part of the TI's application, the TI may request to have its nondeferred impact fees (as anticipated) refunded by the city. If the city council, in their legislative discretion, approves to refund all or any portion of the nondeferred impact fees, then the amount and terms of such refund shall be part of the approval process and be included in the agreement between the TI and the city. Each year hereunder, the TI shall be responsible for ensuring that it is in full compliance with this article and its agreement with the city as a precondition of receiving any award or funds from the city. The city council may elect to exceed any limits established by section 26-57(a) and (c), giving consideration to unique circumstances that may be presented in consideration of an agreement with the TI. 
(d)  Funds necessary to replace the impact fees deferred in any given fiscal year shall be appropriated from any lawful funds other than impact fees, within the operating budget of the city, and paid to the appropriate fund at the time of permitting. 
(e)  In the event the TI closes its business, moves out of the city, or loses its status as a TI at any time during the seven-year deferral period, the TI will be required to pay to the city all impact fees which have been deferred and/or refunded. As a condition for receiving the deferral and/or refund of impact fees, the TI, and the landowner as may be appropriate, will provide the city with a performance bond, letter of credit, or promissory note and mortgage in favor of the city (in such manner and form acceptable to the city in its sole discretion) to enable the city to enforce the restrictions and conditions in this article. The covenants described in this article will be part of the developer's agreement described in section 26-57(a)_above, and may be recorded in the official public records.

(2)  Applications for the economic development ad valorem tax abatement or exemption incentive, must be submitted for approval by the city council within 24 months of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the city for improvements to real property or within 24 months of the purchase/installation of personal property. Applications for ad valorem tax abatement and exemption must be submitted by March 1 of the year following the year in which value was added to the property in order to be eligible for consideration of the exemption for that year. Failure to make application by March 1 of any year constitutes a waiver of the exemption privilege for that year. 
(3)  Application for an ad valorem property tax exemption shall be made on Department of Revenue form #DR-418 (as amended), and upon approval of an agreement between the city and an applicant of an eligible new business or eligible expansion of an existing business, the city may grant, in its sole and absolute discretion, an economic development ad valorem tax abatement/exemption to the new business or expansion of an existing business. 
(4)  The tax abatement/exemption described herein shall not apply to improvements to real property made by or for the use of new businesses or expansions of an existing business when such improvements have been added or increased prior to the adoption of this article, unless an exemption has been previously granted by the city council by ordinance. 
(5)  To grant a tax abatement/exemption under this article, the city council shall adopt an ordinance granting the tax abatement/exemption and the ordinance must include the following:

The appeal shall set forth in particularity all grounds upon which the applicant relies. The city council will use the criteria established by this article to determine the appellant's eligibility to be considered a TI. Failure to timely appeal a decision of the city to the city council pursuant to this article shall constitute a waiver of such review. 
(4)  If the city determines that the applicant is qualified as a TI, then it shall prepare a written recommendation and report to the city council regarding what incentives under this article, if any, should be offered to the applicant. The recommendation and report to the city council will include a project summary (based upon the application and any other information provided to the city), the number of anticipated new jobs created by the project, and the total gross square feet of new development or expansion that will be constructed in connection with the project. The recommendation and report will also include in its analysis:

Chapter 43 - RESERVED 
Chapter 44 - FERTILIZERS 

Sec. 44-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    This ordinance regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This ordinance requires the use of best management practices which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. 
    These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed primarily in and on WeekiWachee Springs in the county, and also in and on natural and/or constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, lakes, estuaries and other water bodies in the city. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the city's residents, and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation also hinders the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both nitrogen and phosphorus contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 46-161. - Creation. 
    There is hereby created a dependent special district, to be known as the "Brooksville Fire District," for the purpose of providing fire protection, prevention and related services within the area comprising the district. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-162. - Area included within district. 
    The land comprising the Brooksville Fire District is all of the lands included within the City of Brooksville, Hernando County, Florida, as the same may be expanded or decreased from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-163. - Governing board. 
    The Brooksville Fire District shall be governed by a board of five members, who shall be the members of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-164. - Powers of district. 
    The Brooksville Fire District shall have the following powers, to be exercised through its governing board, together with all other powers necessary to the effective provision of fire protection and prevention services and to the imposition and collection of special assessments for such purpose: 
(1)  To sue and be sued in its own name;

(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-165. - Finding of special benefit. 
    In creating the Brooksville Fire District, the city council finds and determines that the fire rescue services, facilities, and programs provide a special benefit to property in the district, through the sharing of costs of providing fire protection, prevention and related services; through the provision of fire protection services to developed properties; and through the protection of nearby properties when a fire occurs on any property in the district exceeds each property owner's share of the costs of the necessary and expected expenses incurred by the district each year. In creating the Brooksville Fire District, the city council makes the following legislative findings: 
(1)  Fire rescue services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of improved property by: 
a.  Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the provision of available fire rescue services; 
b.  Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of improvements and structures within improved parcels; 
c.  Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire rescue program within the city; and 
d.  Containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on vacant property with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property. 
(2)  The fire control and first response services of the city under its existing fire rescue program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the use and enjoyment of buildings within improved parcels of property within the areas served by the city. 
(3)  The fire control and first response services of the city under its existing fire rescue program enhance the value of business and commercial property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building which enhanced value can be anticipated to be reflected in the rental charge or value of such business or commercial property. 
(4)  As a consequence of such fire rescue program provided by the city, substantially all of the annual fire rescue budget will be required to meet anticipated demand for fire protection and the costs to be incurred in anticipated stand-alone first response emergency medical services do not represent a material incremental annual budget cost and, therefore, do not materially increase the assessable costs to any parcel. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-166 - Use of city employees and equipment. 
    The city manager is authorized and directed to use city employees and equipment in assisting the Brooksville Fire District in performing its obligations and duties set out in this article and to charge the district the reasonable costs thereof incurred by the city. By accepting the use of such employees and equipment, the district shall agree to pay such costs, which shall be included in the annual assessments. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-167. - Annual assessments-Authority to levy. 
    The board is hereby authorized to impose an annual fire rescue assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire rescue assessed cost upon benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the district's provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs. All fire rescue assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this article. The amount of the fire rescue assessment imposed in a fiscal year against a parcel of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology, based upon a classification of property, designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the fire rescue assessed cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by fire rescue services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require the imposition of fire rescue assessments against government property.

Sec. 46-176. - Interim assessments.

The amount of the interim fire rescue assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire rescue assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire rescue assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim fire rescue assessment is received by the district.

Any interim fire rescue assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date.

(b)  A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 calendar days from the date any installment is due. The board shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its fire rescue assessment within 60 calendar days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the board will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(c)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the district, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the board as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(d)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a fire rescue assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in periodic installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of nonpayment. The board may contract for such billing services with any utility, whether or not such utility is owned by the city. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-178. - Lien of fire rescue assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire rescue assessments, including interim assessments, shall constitute a lien against assessed property. Except as otherwise provided by law, said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the board of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 46-180 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the board of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-179. - Revisions, corrections, omissions and other procedural irregularities. 
(a)  If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the board is satisfied that any such fire rescue assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the board has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the board may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire rescue assessment against any property benefitted by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire rescue assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the board may obtain and impose other fire rescue assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed. 
(b)  Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire rescue assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. 
(c)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, board, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the board under the provision of this article. 
(d)  When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefitted by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the board may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted parcel in the manner and form provided in section 46-172, impose the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered. 
(e)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire rescue assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(f)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-180. - Method of collection. 
    Unless otherwise directed by the board, the fire rescue assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the board shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act or other provision of law. The amount of a fire rescue assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such fire rescue assessment upon certification of a nonad valorem roll to the tax collector by the district. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 3-15-2010) 
Sec. 46-181. - Alternative method of collection. 
    In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the board may elect to collect the fire rescue assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this section:

(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire rescue assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The board shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire rescue assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 calendar days from the date any installment is due. The board or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her fire rescue assessment within 60 calendar days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the board or its agent will either (1) initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property, or (2) cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city or district may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The board or its agent may join in one foreclosure action the collection of fire rescue assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the board and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the board as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the board's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or her or other city officials in section 46-179 hereof. 
(7)  Any board action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by resolution.

(Ord. No. 830, Art. I, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-233. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(a)  Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041, the city council has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions and render municipal services except when prohibited by law and such power may be exercised by the enactment of city ordinances. 
(b)  The city council may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city council may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3). The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3), are not relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire protection services, facilities or programs. 
(c)  The special benefits to affected lands provided as a result of an assessment include by way of example and not limitation, the continual availability and use of fire protection services to each tax parcel within the city, protection of public safety, stable or decreasing insurance costs, a potential increase in value to property, and an assured level of service to landowners and tenants. 
(d)  The constant and continued preparedness to provide fire protection services, facilities and programs possess a logical relationship to the value, use and enjoyment of real property by: 
(1)  Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the continual availability of fire control and provision of fire protection and associated rescue services; 
(2)  Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of real property; 
(3)  Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire protection and associated rescue program within the city; 
(4)  Providing protection for uninsured or underinsured property and property owners; and 
(5)  Containing the spread of fire incidents, sometimes occurring on vacant or undeveloped property, with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of nearby improved property, thereby limiting liability. 
(e)  The combined fire control and associated basic life support emergency medical services of the city under its existing consolidated fire protection program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the value, use and enjoyment of the parcels of property within the city. 
(f)  The assessment imposed pursuant to this article is imposed by the city council, not the property appraiser or tax collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under the provisions of this article shall be construed as ministerial. 
(g)  The annual assessments to be imposed pursuant to this article are special assessments and may also constitute and be described as non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(h)  The purpose of this article is to: 
(1)  Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of city-wide assessments under the home rule powers of a municipality to impose special assessments, 
(2)  Authorize a procedure for the funding of fire protection services, facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city, and 
(3)  Establish a significant tax equity tool which can be used to reduce a dependence on property taxes alone as a source of funding for fire protection services, facilities and programs, reduce demand on other legally available funds, allow for local policy discretion as difficult overall budget choices are made by the city council each year, and give the community a more equitable, balanced, sustainable and dedicated means of funding essential fire protection related services and capital improvements. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. I, 7-2-2012) 
Secs. 46-234-240. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - ANNUAL FIRE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 

Sec. 46-241. - General authority. 
(a)  The city council is hereby authorized to impose an annual assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire service assessed cost upon benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs. For purposes of this article, references to 'benefit', 'special benefit', 'benefited property' or the like also include the relief of a burden to continually stand in readiness created by real property as well as improvements thereon. All assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this division 2. 
(b)  The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year against each parcel of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a fair and reasonable apportionment of the fire service assessed cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by the availability of fire protection services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year shall include administration and collection costs associated with the annual assessment. In the event the assessments are collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the amount of the annual assessment will also include fees imposed by the property appraiser and tax collector and will be adjusted as necessary to account for any statutory discounts which are necessitated when employing the efficiencies of collecting the assessments annually on the same bill as property taxes. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require the imposition of assessments against government property. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-242. - Proceedings. 
    The proceedings for the imposition of an assessment shall include a public hearing noticed in the manner set forth in section 46-244 hereof, and the adoption at or anytime thereafter of an annual assessment resolution which shall: 
(a)  Contain a brief and general description of the fire protection services, facilities or programs to be provided or made available, 
(b)  Describe the method or methods of apportioning the fire service assessed cost among affected tax parcels, 
(c)  Describe the tax parcels, if any, to be exempted from the fire service assessment for legal or public policy purposes, 
(d)  Identify the rate or rates of assessment and approve and adopt the annual assessment roll, consistent with the requirements of section 46-243 hereof, and 
(e)  Determine the method of collecting the fire service assessment. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-243. - Assessment roll. 
(a)  The assessment coordinator shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the assessment roll, which shall contain the following: 
(1)  A summary description of all assessed property by tax parcel conforming to the description contained on the tax roll. 
(2)  The name of the owner of the assessed property. 
(3)  The extension or application of the rates of the proposed assessment to be imposed against each such tax parcel of assessed property. 
(b)  The assessment roll shall be retained by the assessment coordinator and shall be open to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed form if the amount of the assessment for each tax parcel of property can be determined by use of the internet, a computer terminal available to the public or similar technology available to the public. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-244 - Notice. 
    At least 20 days prior to the public hearing, the city shall notice the public hearing by publication in a newspaper generally circulated within the boundaries of the city. The notice shall provide the date, time and place of the hearing. The notice shall contain a general statement that the city council will consider a special assessment throughout the city on the various parcels of property within the city to fund all or a portion of the cost to continually be available and stand ready to provide fire protection services, facilities and programs, the proposed rates or explanation of the schedule of assessments and include general information pertaining to the proposed apportionment methodology, the method of collection and a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the public hearing and the right to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. The notice shall direct all interested persons to the assessment roll and information concerning the amount of the proposed assessment applicable to each parcel of property; provided, however, that such assessment roll need not be in printed form if the amount of the assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of the internet, a computer terminal available to the public, or similar technology available to the public. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-245. - Annual assessment resolution. 
    At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the city council, the city council shall receive any written comments or objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the city council, adopt the annual assessment resolution which shall: 
(a)  Establish the rate or rates of assessment to be imposed in the designated fiscal year; 
(b)  Approve and adopt the assessment roll, with such amendments and directions as it deems just and right; and 
(c)  Provide direction as to the method of collection. All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from the fire protection services, facilities, or programs to be provided or constructed and the assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned between the properties that receive the special benefit. All objections to the annual assessment resolution shall be made in writing, and filed with the assessment coordinator at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The annual assessment resolution as confirmed shall constitute the final action necessary annually to impose or re-impose assessments hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-246. - Effect of annual assessment resolution. 
    The assessments for the initial fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year shall be established upon adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate or rates of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city council action adopting and confirming on the annual assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be delivered for collection using the traditional direct billing method of collection described in section 46-262 hereof to collect the assessments, or such other method as the city council by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-247. - Adoption of subsequent annual assessment resolutions. 
    The city council may adopt subsequent annual assessment resolutions as a part of and during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which an assessment is imposed hereunder. The annual assessment resolution shall approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year. The assessment roll may be prepared in accordance with the methods of apportionment set forth in the prior assessment resolution but may include modifications as a matter of policy as to what, if any, portion or portions of the city's budget is paid for from legally available funds other than assessment revenues. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-248. - Alternative use of Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(a)  The city may determine to use the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however that all of the extraordinary procedures required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act can be and are timely complied with. 
(b)  In the event the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is determined to be used, the assessment coordinator shall publish notice which shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and, in addition to the requirements set forth in this article, the assessment coordinator shall provide notice of the proposed assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment which shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such mailed notice may be provided by including the assessment in the property appraiser's notice of proposed property taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments under F.S. § 200.069, or its successor in function. The assessment coordinator may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the owner to receive notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall nevertheless not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this article. 
(c)  The city council may also establish by resolution or directive such reasonable procedures or directions to confirm and comply with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as may be practicable and necessary. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude the city council from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and (1) the proposed assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the city council and included in notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) the method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (3) assessed property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice and opportunity to be heard shall be provided to the owners of such assessed property. Such notice shall substantially conform to the notice requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and inform the owner of the time, date and place for adoption of the annual assessment resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this article. 
(e)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified and delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-249. - Lien of fire service assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, until paid such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims. The lien for an Assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city council of the annual assessment resolution. The lien for an assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Method shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for an assessment collected under the traditional method of collection provided in section 46-262 hereof shall be deemed perfected upon adoption and confirmation by the city council of the annual assessment resolution, after a public hearing, and shall attach to the property on such date of each such annual assessment resolution. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-250. - Revisions to fire service assessments. 
    If any assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city council is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city council has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the city council may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the fire service assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city council may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-251. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-252. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, assessment coordinator, city council, or their deputies, employees, or agents shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council under the provision of this article. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the city council may, upon provision of notice to the owner by first class mail, impose the applicable assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such total assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in division 3. 
(c)  The assessment coordinator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to an assessment, based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this article or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the assessment coordinator is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that due to specific circumstances do not receive a special benefit, are not developable (e.g. subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, right-of-way, common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such assessments. Unless the assessment coordinator determines that a tax parcel does benefit, for any tax parcel with a just or market value of less than $1,000.00 (as determined solely by the property appraiser), such value may be used as a prima facie determination that the tax parcel need not be included on the assessment roll. Any such corrections shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the assessment coordinator and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the assessment coordinator. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-253. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The amount of the interim assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual assessment resolution for the fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent year's assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(b)  Exclusive of property for which an interim assessment was paid pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, an interim assessment shall also be imposed against any property which for any reason was omitted from the fire service assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual tax parcel as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual assessment resolution for any upcoming fiscal year. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property for which it is imposed. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-254. - Administrative hardship deferment. 
(a)  Annually upon application of the owner of a tax parcel subject to the assessments contemplated herein, the assessment coordinator may grant a hardship deferment, in which case the tax parcel in question will receive a deferral. The owner shall be required to execute a binding agreement encumbering the tax parcel and otherwise assure the city that payment in full of the assessment and any recording cost, plus interest at an estimated cost of city funds compounded annually, shall be due over a period of time or upon sale or transfer of the property. Such agreement or a memorandum thereof shall be recorded in the official records of Hernando County, Florida. Dependent upon the volume or demand for such deferment, the city council may determine to release such deferments in the future. However, all funding for such hardship deferment, or the consequences of the deferment or any future release, shall be from legally available funds other than direct proceeds of other assessments. The assessment coordinator is authorized to use sound public administration judgment in applying this authority and considering such applications. 
(b)  This provision serves to promote a public purpose and the general welfare, morals and contentment of the inhabitants and residents of the city. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. II, 7-2-2012) 
Secs. 46-255-46-260. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION OF FIRE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 

Sec. 46-261. - Collection. 
(a)  The process of collection is driven by many equitable, practical and economic factors. The traditional direct billing method is initially far less expensive and provides fair and adequate notice and opportunity to be heard through publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The uniform method of collection additionally provides extraordinary notice by individual mailing, but such notice is many times more expensive than published notice. The individually mailed notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is extraordinary and unique to collection of an assessment occurring along with and included on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes. 
(b)  Unless otherwise directed by the city council, the assessments shall be collected pursuant to the traditional direct billing method provided in section 46-262 hereof. Any hearing or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by this article or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. III, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-262. - Traditional method of collection. 
    The city may elect to collect the assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or provided by this section as follows: 
(a)  The city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the assessment, 
(2)  A description of the unit of measurement or method used to determine the amount of the assessment, 
(3)  The number of units contained within the tax parcel, 
(4)  The rate or rates applied to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period, 
(5)  The location at which payment will be accepted, 
(6)  The date on which the assessment is due, and 
(7)  A statement that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(b)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments throughout the city may be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(c)  The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent assessments in the manner provided by law. 
(d)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent may either: 
(1)  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
(2)  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(e)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(f)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses otherwise reasonably attributable thereto, may be collected subsequently pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
(1)  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and 
(2)  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(g)  Any city council action required in the collection of assessments may be by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. III, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-263. - Uniform method of collection. 
(a)  In lieu of utilizing any other method of collection available to the city, the city may elect to collect assessments using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and, for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and expenses and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(1)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, 
(2)  Notice is provided to the owner, and 
(3)  Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(b)  If the city council determines the assessments are to be collected on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes, then the assessment coordinator shall comply and conform to the extraordinary requirements of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 830, Art. III, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 46-264. - Government property. 
(a)  To the extent permitted by law, the city reserves the right to impose a charge or fee comparable in amount to assessments on governmental property. As used in this section, the context of the term 'assessment' shall refer to such a charge or fee. If assessments are imposed against government property, the city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner or agent of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the assessment, 
(2)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the assessment, 
(3)  The number of units contained within the tax parcel, 
(4)  The rate or rates applicable to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period, 
(5)  The location at which payment will be accepted, and 
(6)  The date on which the assessment is due. 
(b)  Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in 12 installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city council may also contract for such billing services with any utility not otherwise owned by the city.

(l)  The city council finds and determines that without regulation, public nudity constitutes harmful conduct and occurs in a manner which is incompatible with the normal primary activity of a particular place at a particular time. 
(m)  The city council's sole intent in enacting this article is to prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the adverse secondary effects such nudity generates, the city council nevertheless recognizes that there may be instances wherein appearing nude in a public place may be expressive conduct incidental to and a necessary part of the freedom of expression that is protected by United States or Florida constitutional provisions. 
(n)  A requirement that dancers don opaque covering sufficient to cover the buttocks and the breasts as such portions of the human anatomy are defined in this article does not deprive the dance of whatever erotic message, if any, it may convey, but simply makes such message, if any, slightly less graphic and imposes only an incidental limitation on the message. 
(o)  It is the intent of the city council to protect and preserve the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the city by restricting, to the full extent allowed by the United States and Florida constitutions, the act of being nude to places which are not frequented by the public and places which are not readily visible to the public. 
(p)  The city is essentially a rural-suburban community without the sophistication and urbanity of a large metropolitan area. 
(q)  The city council finds and determines that the average person applying contemporary the city community standards would find that the public nudity prohibited by this article, if allowed, when taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interests and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value. 
(r)  Nonregulation of persons appearing nude in public places within the city may encourage commercial entities and other entities and persons to advertise outside of the city and the state by billboard, radio, print and other media the availability of nudity in public places within the city and thus encourages the influx into the city of persons seeking to observe and/or participate in such nudity and to participate in the disorderly, harmful, and unlawful conduct that is associated therewith, thereby increasing injuries and damages to the citizens of this county who will be victims of such increased disorderly, harmful, and unlawful conduct. 
(s)  Competitive commercial advertising and/or exploitation of nudity encourages escalation of nude and lewd conduct within the competing commercial establishments exploiting such conduct and thereby increases the adverse effects upon public order and the public health. 
(t)  The city council finds and determines that the prohibitions contained in this article are the most reasonable and minimal restrictions required so as to regulate conduct which is adverse to public order, health, morality, and decency within the city when such conduct takes place at locations where the public is present or is likely to be present, or where such conduct would be readily visible to the public. 
(u)  The passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived is necessary to preserve the basic character of the city. 
(v)  The city council is aware that states may regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public places (see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 115 L.Ed 2d 504, 111 S.Ct. 2456 (1991), and City of Erie v. Paps AM, Case No. 98-1161 (U.S. Sup. Ct., March 29, 2000)). 
(w)  The city council is not hereby prohibiting nudity in truly private places or prohibiting nudity which is protected by United States or Florida constitutional provisions. 
(x)  The city council finds and determines that the express exemption contained in section 58-38(2) provides adequate protection to persons who, without such express exemption, might otherwise be prevented or discouraged by this article from exercising constitutionally protected rights. 
(y)  The city council finds and determines that this article is consistent with its current comprehensive plan.

Sec. 58-33. - Legislative findings. 
    In addition and supplemental to the findings and determinations contained in section 58-32, it is hereby found by the city council, acting in its legislative capacity for the purpose of regulating the conduct of appearing nude in public places and for the purpose of regulating nudity and other conduct in establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages, that, considering what has happened in other communities, the acts prohibited in section 58-36 encourage or create the potential for the conduct of prostitution, attempted rape, rape, and assault in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages; that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct, coupled with the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places, begets and has the potential for begetting undesirable and unlawful behavior; that sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among patrons and employees within establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages results in violation of law and creates dangers to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the public and those who engage in such conduct; and, it is the intent of section 58-36 to specifically prohibit nudity, gross sexuality and the simulation thereof in establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages. 
(Ord. No. 662, § 2(11-14), 12-15-2003) 
Sec. 58-34. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this article to protect and preserve the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the citizens of the city by prohibiting a person from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude, or causing another person to appear or be nude, in a public place and in other places which may reasonably be expected to be observed by the public within the unincorporated areas of the city except: 
(1)  When such person appears nude in a place provided or set apart for nudity provided such person is nude for the sole purpose of performing the legal function that is customarily intended to be performed within such place provided or set apart for nudity and provided such person is not nude for the purpose of obtaining money or other financial gain for such person or for another person or entity; or 
(2)  When the conduct of being nude cannot legally be prohibited by this article either because it constitutes a part of a bona fide live communication, demonstration or performance by such person wherein such nudity is expressive conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a genuine message or public expression and is not a guise or pretense utilized to exploit nudity for profit or commercial gain (see for instance County Commissioners v. Dexterhouse, 348 So. 2d 916 (Fla. 2nd DCA 1977)) and as such is protected by the United States or Florida Constitution, or because it is otherwise protected by the United States or Florida Constitutions.

(2)  Are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration; and 
(3)  Are dispensed in accordance with Florida and federal law.

The customer will ensure that only personnel properly trained in the operations of the compactor will be allowed to operate the same. Storage areas and areas adjacent to the storage area shall be maintained by the customer in a neat, sanitary and sightly manner. Collectors, whether city personnel or contracted personnel, are not allowed to sweep, pick up or otherwise clean up storage areas unless such service has been specifically agreed to. Customers are responsible for maintaining the accessibility to the compactor area for collection purposes. Collections which are agreed to but are missed due to the customer's failure to maintain accessibility shall not constitute a violation of agreement on the part of the city or contractor, if applicable, and customers requesting later or make-up service as a result, shall be billed according to the agreed upon cost of such service being provided. The compactor and associated facilities and equipment on-site will be maintained by the party holding title of ownership to the same, and will be performed in such a manner that minimum interruption of service will be experienced as well as to provide the aesthetic level of acceptability required for such activities. 
(c)  Providing for service. The city shall have the right to provide commercial compactor service to any such commercial establishments as shall be determined by the city to require such service. If it is determined by the city that the rendering of such service by the city would not be in the city's or the customer's best interest, the customer may then be allowed in turn to acquire such service from a private or public contractor, subject to the city being a party to such a contractual arrangement in accordance with the following conditions: 
(1)  A two-party written agreement shall be entered into between the customer and the contracting collector outlining the terms, conditions and rates under which the service shall be provided. Terms and conditions shall be written in such a manner as to constitute no violation of any law, regulation, policy or directive of any competent jurisdictional authority governing solid waste storage, collection or disposal activities. 
(2)  The agreement, as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, shall become a part of and be incorporated with a tri-party agreement which shall then be entered into between the city, the collector and the customer. This tri-party agreement shall incorporate certain applicable provisions of this division and shall define the terms and conditions upon which service shall be provided. As a condition precedent, the contracting collector shall provide the city and customer proof of liability insurance, proof of bonding or irrevocable letter of credit from an acceptable financial institution guaranteeing payment of damages to the customer for nonperformance or breach of the agreement on the part of the collector in that amount which would represent the average charge for compactor collection service over a 30-day period, not to exceed $2,000.00. A blanket bond or letter of credit may be provided to cover each such infractionary incident that might occur. 
(3)  The city shall charge a monthly fee when service is provided by written agreement with a private contractor approved by the city. Such fee, which shall be set by the city council, by resolution, shall be representative of the cost incurred by the city in administering the contract, inspection of compactor and storage facilities on a continuing basis, and controlling the overall storage, collection and disposal activities. The fee shall be paid monthly and the contractor will provide the city with a copy of the invoices rendered to such customers as an attachment to the check remitting the fee payment. The customer shall remit payment directly to the collector in accordance with the terms agreed to in the written agreement mentioned in subsection (c)(1) of this section. 
(d)  Rates for service. When the city shall provide the compactor service, such service shall be performed by a written agreement between the city and the customer. The agreement shall incorporate all applicable provisions of this division, and the fee for such service shall be assessed monthly in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  The monthly rates for compactor service shall be based on the cubic yard capacity of the compactor at a rate which shall be set by city council, by resolution. 
(2)  At the discretion of the city the customer may be allowed to furnish and maintain the compactor and associated equipment if such should be determined to be in the best interest of both the customer and the city. In such event, the customer would only be assessed the per cubic yard rate aforesaid. 
(3)  Should solid waste disposal costs change as has been delineated by section 70-134, then the provisions for rate adjustment so provided shall be implemented with the exception that such rate adjustment will not apply to that monthly amount assessed for rental of equipment.

Such charges are mandatory for each occupied dwelling unit not receiving commercial or residential centralized collection service. A dwelling unit is considered occupied and a service charge will be applied for each month that either a water bill is prepared for domestic consumption or for the individual unit for which water service was provided through a master meter for such use, regardless of whether the dwelling unit is actually occupied. A fee shall also be set by city council, by resolution, for those customers who make application to the city for periods when the dwelling will be vacant. Such period in which this vacancy rate shall apply shall not be less than three consecutive monthly billing periods.

Customers are required to keep all refuse in the containers and to keep the container lids closed. The city shall not be responsible for refuse clean-up or collection of any refuse not placed in the proper receptacles.

Sec. 70-132. - Delinquent date; penalty; charge to constitute debt; occupation of building as prima facie evidence of garbage, trash. 
(a)  Delinquent date; penalty. If any service charges shall not be paid within 20 days after the same shall be due and payable, same shall be delinquent and there shall be added to such charges a penalty of ten percent of such charges to cover the additional administrative costs incurred by the city by reason of the failure of the customer to pay the charges within 20 days after the same shall be due and payable and the department shall cease to serve the premises or parcel of land for which such delinquent charges are due and payable until such charges and penalty shall be paid, and, if such premises, or parcel of land, for which such charges shall be delinquent shall be served by the waterworks system of the city, the water department of the city shall cease to serve such premises with water until such delinquent charges and penalty shall be paid. The city may, but shall not be obligated to, give notice of delinquency of payment. 
(b)  Charge to constitute debt. The service charges hereinabove prescribed shall be and constitute a debt to the city for which the owner, tenant or occupant shall be jointly and severally liable. The records of the city shall be kept open for the inspection by the owner, tenant or occupant and it shall be the responsibility of each of them to ascertain that the prescribed service charges are paid or are being paid. 
(c)  Occupation of building or rendering of water service shall be prima facie evidence of garbage, trash, refuse, etc. The fact that any place or unit of abode or any place of business is either occupied or being rendered water service for domestic consumption and use shall be prima facie evidence that garbage, trash, or refuse, or all is being produced and accumulated upon such premises and that service charges for the collection and disposal thereof are due the city, notwithstanding the provisions contained in section 70-86, wherein residential curbside customers only have been approved for the vacancy rate as has been established and set forth herein.

(b)  Payment. The fee shall be paid at time of issuance of the first building permit for the development, service request by the customer, or at such time as an increase in level of service shall be determined to be appropriate and provided by the city in accordance with and under the provisions of section 70-33(a), whichever is the earlier, in that amount as has been provided for in this section in order that dumpsters may be reserved and/or acquired by the city to serve the customer or entire development at build out, as appropriate. 
(c)  Changes in level of service. Should it become necessary to either install dumpsters or increase the capacity or number of dumpsters to serve the customer or development, as appropriate, an additional capital recovery fee shall be levied to such customer or development, on a pro rata basis according to the difference in the current cost of which shall be incurred by the city in providing the increased level of service versus that current replacement value of those dumpsters serving such customer or development prior to such increase. In the case of multiple customers sharing a common dumpster and which an increase in level of service shall be required, then a capital recovery fee shall be levied upon the customer, as appropriate, which shall have necessitated or requested such increase in level of service and such fee shall be payable at the time stipulated in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Amount. The amount to be levied shall be determined by the director of sanitation and shall be based on the actual capital cost which has been or is expected to be incurred by the city in providing that level of service required for the customer or development. Such cost shall be predicated and calculated on either that cost actually incurred in acquiring the dumpsters needed, according to number and capacity, or that lowest amount reflected in the most current bid proposals for such dumpsters, whichever is the greater amount. 
(e)  Use of revenues. The revenue which shall be generated as a result of the provisions contained in this section, shall only be utilized to purchase new dumpsters when needed to maintain inventory or provide new service, or liquidate any debt obligation which might have been incurred in providing such dumpster service.

Notwithstanding the sale of any such certificate, such suit may be brought by and in the name of the city in all cases where the city has been called on under its guaranty to pay any defaulted installment, and a certified copy of such certificate may be introduced in evidence in such foreclosure suit. The costs and expenses of bringing such suit, including such reasonable attorney's fees as the city may have agreed to pay, shall be considered and held an additional charge and lien, by way of penalty, against the property involved, and the city shall be entitled to recover the same in such suit.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 758-A, § 14, adopted June 21, 2010, amends and restates the former Art. V, §§ 74-201-74-214, and enacted a new Art. V as set out herein. The former Art. V pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 758, §§ 1-14, adopted Apr. 21, 2008. 

Sec. 74-201. - Legislative findings and purposes. 
(a)  The foregoing recitals are hereby adopted as the legislative findings of the City Council of the City of Brooksville and incorporated into this article as if set forth in haec verba. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to authorize the use of traffic infraction detectors to promote compliance with red light signal directives, and to adopt a civil enforcement system for red light signal violations, all in accord with general law. 
(c)  This article will supplement law enforcement personnel in the enforcement of red light signal violations and shall not prohibit law enforcement officers from issuing a citation for a red light signal violation in accordance with normal statutory traffic enforcement techniques. 
(d)  The city uses the speed of ten miles per hour as a determination of making a right hand turn in a careful and prudent manner based upon a study by the state department of transportation. This determination is made only because of the insertion by the state of the term of careful and prudent, irrespective of the traffic law requiring a complete stop at the stop bar before making a right turn. Additionally, the city accepts and adopts the specifications adopted by the state department of transportation for traffic infraction detectors and amends said specifications contemporaneously with any amendments made by the state department of transportation. 
(Ord. No. 758-A, § 1, 6-21-2010; Ord. No. 758-B, § 1, 3-16-2015)

    Careful and prudent manner shall mean having regard for width, grade, curves, corners, traffic, actual and potential hazards, and all other attendant circumstances so as not to endanger pedestrians, other motor vehicles, or the property of another while making a right turn. In addition to the above considerations, a vehicle being driven at a rate of speed, captured at the stop bar, of ten miles per hour, is not being driven in a careful and prudent manner. However, due to the error rate of + or - one mile per hour of the device capturing the speed of a vehicle, the city will not enforce a violation of a right turn below 11 miles per hour unless there is evidence of a lack of regards to the initial considerations listed in this definition. 
    Intersection means the area embraced within the prolongation or connection of the lateral curb line; or if none, then the lateral boundary lines, of the roadways of two roads which join or intersect one another at, or approximately at, right angles; or the area within which vehicles traveling upon different roads joining at any other angle may come in conflict. 
    Motor vehicle means the meaning set forth in the definition in F.S. § 316.003(21) or its successor provision. 
    Notice of violation means a notice issued for a red zone infraction. 
    Owner means the person or entity identified by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, or other state vehicle registration office, as the registered owner of a vehicle. Such term shall also mean a lessee of a motor vehicle pursuant to a lease of six months or more. 
    Recorded images means images recorded by a traffic infraction detector including but not limited to photographic images, electronic images, or streaming video images. 
    Red zone infraction means a traffic offense whereby a traffic infraction detector established that a motor vehicle entered an intersection controlled by a duly erected traffic control signal at a time when the traffic control signal for such motor vehicle's direction of travel was emitting a steady red signal. Additionally, an infraction also includes a vehicle being driven in an attempt at making a right turn while violating the defined careful and prudent standard. 
    Traffic control signal means a device exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively, one at a time, or in combination, using only the colors green, yellow, and red which indicate and apply to drivers of motor vehicles as provided in F.S. § 316.075. 
    Traffic infraction detector means a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with a traffic control signal and a camera or cameras synchronized to automatically record two or more sequenced photographic or electronic images or streaming video of only the rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop behind the stop bar or clearly marked stop line when facing a traffic control signal steady red light. 
    Traffic infraction enforcement officer means the city police department employee designated, pursuant to section 74-207 herein, to review recorded images and issue notices of violation based on those images. 
(Ord. No. 758-A, § 2, 6-21-2010; Ord. No. 758-B, § 2, 3-16-2015) 
Sec. 74-203. - Adherence to red light traffic control signals. 
    A motor vehicle facing a traffic control signal's steady red light indication shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of an intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown on the traffic control signal; provided, however, the driver of a motor vehicle facing a traffic control signal's steady red light may make a right-hand turn in a careful and prudent manner at an intersection where right-hand turns are permissible. 
(Ord. No. 758-A, § 3, 6-21-2010) 
Sec. 74-204. - Use of traffic infraction detectors. 
    The city shall utilize recorded images from traffic infraction detectors as a supplemental means of monitoring compliance with the laws related to traffic control signals and as an ancillary deterrent to traffic control and red zone infractions. This article shall not supersede, infringe, curtail or impinge upon any state laws related to red light signal violations or conflict with such laws. 
(Ord. No. 758-A, § 4, 6-21-2010) 
Sec. 74-205. - Introductory period.

Sec. 82-73. - Procedures upon seizure or impoundment.

(1)  Arrange for the towing or removal of the vehicle; and, 
(2)  Provide written notice to any owner present, or person in control of the vehicle, of the fact of the seizure, the right to request a preliminary hearing pursuant to section 82-74 and the right to request a final hearing pursuant to section 82-75; and,

(Ord. No. 774, § 3, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 82-74. - Preliminary hearing. 
    Any owner of a seized or impounded vehicle may request a preliminary hearing in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  Within five calendar days of receipt of the notice of seizure any owner may request a preliminary hearing by delivering to the city, at the address set forth in the notice, a written request for a preliminary hearing. The written request must be received by the city within the allotted time or the right to a preliminary hearing shall be waived. The request must include a telephone number(s) where the owner or the owner's designated agent can be telephonically notified of the date, time and location of the preliminary hearing, and the hours indicating when the owner or designated agent will be available for such telephonic notification. 
(2)  Upon timely receipt of an owner's written request for a preliminary hearing, the city shall schedule a hearing to be held within five calendar days following the date of receipt of the request, or as soon as practicable thereafter. Notice of the preliminary hearing shall be provided in accordance with notice requirements set forth in Article VIII, Section 8-1.5(g)(4) of the Land Development Code and shall include the date, time and location of the preliminary hearing. If the requesting owner fails to attend the preliminary hearing, and the hearing officer finds that the city has complied with the notice procedures, as set forth herein, then such failure shall constitute a waiver of the owner's right to a preliminary hearing. Any failure of the requesting owner to receive actual notice of the preliminary hearing shall not otherwise invalidate the administrative penalty proceedings as set forth herein. 
(3)  The preliminary hearing shall be held before a hearing officer. The sole issue to be considered by the hearing officer is whether the seizing police officer, or other officer or agent of the City, had probable cause under this section to seize and impound the vehicle. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply and hearsay evidence, including any relevant police report, is admissible. The burden of demonstrating probable cause is on the city. 
(4)  If a preliminary hearing is not requested, or if it was waived, or if the hearing officer finds that there was probable cause to seize and impound the vehicle, then the vehicle shall continue to be impounded pending final hearing or the payment of the appropriate administrative civil penalty or fine, as designated in section 82-79, together with all towing costs and storage and outstanding penalties or fines for citations previously issued. Alternatively, the owner may secure release of the vehicle by posting a cash bond, either by money order or certified check, in the amount of the administrative penalty together with all towing and storage costs and outstanding penalties or fines for citations previously issued, plus final hearing costs of $50.00. If no probable cause is found at the preliminary hearing, the vehicle shall be released to the owner as soon as practical without the imposition of an administrative fine, towing and storage costs or hearing costs. 
(Ord. No. 774, § 4, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 82-75. - Final hearing. 
    A final hearing may be requested by any owner in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  The vehicle owner may request a final hearing by delivering to the city, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice of seizure, a request for a final hearing. The request must be delivered to the address provided in the notice of seizure and must include an address where the owner or the owner's designated agent can be notified of the date, time, and place of the final hearing. 
(2)  Upon timely receipt of a request for final hearing, the city shall schedule a hearing to be held within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the request, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The city shall provide written notice, in accordance with notice requirements set forth in Article VIII, Section 8-1.5(g)(4) of the Land Development Code, to the requesting owner at the address on the request for final hearing. The notice shall state the date, time and location of the final hearing to be conducted by the hearing officer pursuant to this section. 
(3)  If an owner fails to timely request a final hearing, or if the owner fails to attend the final hearing, and the hearing officer finds that the city has complied with the notice procedures as set forth herein, then such failure shall constitute a waiver of the owner's right to a final hearing and it shall be deemed admitted that the seized vehicle was used in violation of section 82-72. 
(4)  If not waived, the final hearing shall be held before the hearing officer. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the final hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. The city shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in section 82-72. It shall be a defense that the vehicle was stolen at the time that it was seized and impounded; or that the owner was without knowledge as to the use of the vehicle in any violation of section 82-72. The owner of the vehicle shall have the burden to prove said defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(5)  If the final hearing has been waived, or if, after the hearing, the hearing officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in section 82-72, the hearing officer shall enter an order authorizing the continued impoundment of the vehicle pending payment of the appropriate administrative civil penalty prescribed in section 82-79, towing and storage costs, outstanding penalties or fines for citations previously issued and hearing costs of $50.00 or until otherwise released by the city. In the event that an owner is in possession of his or her vehicle due to a bond posted pursuant to section 82-74 and the bond amount is insufficient to satisfy the administrative civil penalty and costs identified in the hearing officer's order, the remaining balance shall be paid within five calendar days of the date of the final order. If the hearing officer finds that the city did not meet its burden of proof, or that the vehicle owner has proven by a preponderance of the evidence a valid defense as set forth in paragraph (4) above, the vehicle shall be released to the vehicle owner as soon as practicable without the imposition of an administrative penalty, towing, storage or hearing costs, and any cash bond posted shall be returned. 
(Ord. No. 774, § 5, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 82-76. - Enforcement; sale; proceeds; lien. 
(a)  A copy of the final order issued by the hearing officer shall be recorded in the public record and, upon recording shall constitute a lien against the vehicle. The city as holder of a lien against the vehicle, to the extent the lien has not been discharged or otherwise satisfied, may enforce the lien in any manner provided by law after 90 calendar days from the date of the final order. 
(b)  If the vehicle against which the lien is created is still under impoundment 90 calendar days from the date of the final order and the owner has not satisfied the lien or the lien has not otherwise been discharged, the city may elect to sell the vehicle through a public sale or auction. 
(c)  If the custodian elects to sell the vehicle, he or she must do so at public sale by competitive bidding. Notice of the time and place of the sale shall be given to the owner and an advertisement of the sale shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the sale is to be held. The notice shall include a statement that the sale shall be subject to any and all liens, except the city's lien. The advertisement must include a description of the vehicle and the time and place of the sale. The sale may take place no earlier than ten calendar days after the final publication. 
(d)  If the owner is absent from the sale, the proceeds of a public sale pursuant to this section, after payment and satisfaction of the city's lien and the costs of transportation, storage and publication of notice, shall be deposited with the City into an interest-bearing trust account not later than 30 calendar days after the date of sale and held there for one year. If no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the date of the sale, the proceeds shall become the property of the city and deposited into the appropriate city fund. 
(e)  In the event that the sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the amount owed pursuant to the hearing officer's final order and the costs of transportation, storage and publication of notice, the order shall constitute a lien against any real or personal property owned by the vehicle owner. Such lien shall be superior to all other liens, except a lien for taxes, and shall bear interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, as set forth in F.S. § 687.03, as amended from time to time, from the date of its filing. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the real or personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. The city attorney or his designee is authorized to foreclose any lien established hereby in the same manner as is provided by law for the foreclosure of other municipal liens or alternatively, as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages. No lien created pursuant to this chapter may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under § 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. In an action to enforce an order or to foreclose on a lien as provided in this section, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, which it incurs thereby. 
(f)  Any vehicle not disposed by public sale shall become the property of the city and may thereafter be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 774, § 6, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 82-77. - Exceptions.

(b)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from releasing a vehicle seized under the provisions of this article, if such release is determined to be in the best interests of the city. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the city from enforcing the provisions of this article against a vehicle initially seized pursuant to the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (but not both) if in the best interest of the city. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude the city from utilizing the procedures specified under state law or under Chapter 38 of the City's Code of Ordinances governing the towing, storage and liens for the removal and storage of abandoned motor vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 774, § 7, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 82-78. - Appeals.

An appeal shall be filed within 30 calendar days of the execution of the order to be appealed. The nature of the appeal shall be from a final administrative order.

Sec. 86-101. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Sewage disposal system means and includes those facilities owned and operated by the city for the disposal of sanitary sewage and embracing all conduits, structures and appurtenances through which the sewage flows to the point of final disposition, including such purification and treatment facilities and works as may be provided during the course of such disposal. 
    Sewer system means the completed municipal sewer system, including any sanitary sewers and lateral sewer lines or other sewer facilities heretofore constructed or acquired by the city, together with any and all improvements, extensions and additions to the sewer system or any part thereof, hereafter constructed or acquired, and shall include, without being limited to, all lands or interest therein, plants, buildings, machinery, franchises, pipes, fixtures, equipment, and all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, now or hereafter owned or used in connection with the sewer system. 
    Wastewater system shall have the same meaning as the term "sewer system" as defined in this section. 
(Code 1988, § 17-71) 
Sec. 86-102. - Structures for human habitation to be provided with water-carried sewerage when city sewer available; disposal requirements. 
(a)  No person shall build or remodel or cause to be built or remodeled any structure used for human habitation or occupancy within the city which is within 200 feet of a public sanitary sewer line, unless it is provided with water-carried sewerage facilities. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person owning or leasing any premises in the city to permit the disposal of any human excrement on any property, leased or rented by any such person or the agent of any such person except in a sanitary water closet where sewage lines are available. 
(Code 1988, § 17-72) 
Sec. 86-103. - Connection with sewer. 
(a)  Required if service available. The owner of each lot or parcel of land, upon which lot or parcel of land any building, or mobile home trailer used as a dwelling, is now situated or shall hereafter be situated, for either residential, commercial or industrial use, shall connect or cause such buildings, trailers or mobile homes to be connected with the public facilities of the municipal sewer system of the city and use such facilities within one year after notification by the city that the sewer system is available as defined in F.S. § 381.0065. All such connections shall be made in accordance with rules and regulations which may be adopted from time to time by the city council, which rules and regulations shall provide a charge for making such connections in such reasonable amount as the council may determine and fix by resolution. Since sewer rates are based on water consumption, connection to the city's water system shall be required at the same time as connection to the sewer system is required under this subsection if the city's water system is also available and if the lot or parcel of land is not already connected to another central water system. 
(b)  Upon failure of owner to comply connections may be made by city; procedure for recovering cost. If any such owner of any lot or parcel of land shall fail and refuse to connect with and use the facilities of the sewer system of the city after notification by the city, then the city shall be authorized to begin assessing monthly user fees or make such connections, entering on or upon any such lot or parcel of land for the purpose of making such connection. The city shall thereupon be entitled to recover the cost of making such connection, together with applicable installation and impact fees, reasonable penalties, interest and attorney's fees, by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition and as an alternative means of collecting the cost of making such connections, the city shall have a lien on such lot or parcel of land for the cost, which lien shall be of equal dignity with the lien of state, county and municipal taxes. Such lien may be foreclosed by the city in the same manner provided by state laws for the foreclosure of mortgages upon real estate. 
(c)  Use of septic tank restricted; discontinuance of use upon availability of city sewer. Every residence and building in which human beings reside, are employed or congregated shall be required to have an approved method of disposing of human excrement, namely either a sanitary water closet that is connected to the city sewer, or an approved type of septic tank. A septic tank may be used only if the sewer system is not available as defined in F.S. § 381.0065. When the sewer system becomes available, the use of any septic tank, cesspool or privy, privy vault, or any other similar private sewage disposal facility shall cease upon one year's notice from the city.

(b)  Failure to keep the sewer pipe, i.e., the pipe leading from the plumbing system to the city main, clean and maintained in a proper manner will give the city the right to cut off the water connection, which shall not be reconnected until the sewer pipe is cleaned and maintained properly. In those instances where the owner has his own private water supply, the city shall have the right to cut off such water supply to the plumbing system, and the owner shall have no right to reconnect his own private water supply until the sewer pipe leading from the plumbing system to the city main has been maintained and cleaned and is in proper condition. Any violation of this provision by reconnecting his private water supply or the connection from the city water line, until such sewer pipes are cleaned and maintained properly, shall be considered a violation of this article.

Within two weeks of receipt of request for final review, and the furnishing of all additional information requested, the public works department shall advise the applicant in the appropriate sections of the form "application for water or sanitary sewer service" as to the impact fees, point of connection, and any other pertinent information. All applications for water or sanitary sewer service, other than for one single-family residential unit, will be formally approved by the execution of a utility service agreement in a format and with stipulations as shall be determined by the public works department. Such utility service agreement may be executed on the part of the city by the city manager. 
(Code 1988, § 17-185) 
Sec. 86-279. - Vesting title to extended lines in city. 
(a)  Before allowing or agreeing to any extension of the water or sanitary sewer system, the public works department shall approve a route to be adopted for such extension, and shall require the applicant to procure and deliver to the city deeds conveying an easement of way over the entire route proposed for the constructing and maintenance of such extension. 
(b)  As a condition of service, upon completion and start-up of such extension and after a minimum of a one-year warranty period, the applicant shall transfer and assign the same to the city by a deed of conveyance or through a utility service agreement, vesting title to such lines the city has agreed to accept. 
(Code 1988, § 17-186) 
Sec. 86-280. - Construction costs for water and sanitary sewer line extensions. 
    Water and sanitary sewer line extension costs shall be borne by the person applying for such service unless the city has agreed to participate in a portion of the costs as provided for by section 86-289. 
(Code 1988, § 17-187) 
Sec. 86-281. - Impact fees. 
(a)  Impact fees shall be uniform and based upon current or projected expansion costs of potable water supply facilities or sanitary sewer facilities. Impact fees for all single-family residential units shall be assessed on an equivalent residential unit (ERU) basis. Multifamily, apartments and mobile or modular homes in a park will be assessed at 64 percent of the ERU rate. The above residential rates are predicated on the basis that an ERU contains 24 water supply fixture units and 24 drainage fixture units. For the purpose of calculating flows, an ERU is considered 250 gallons per day for water and 200 gallons per day for sanitary sewer. The city has the authority to recalculate and determine the appropriate impact fee should a conflict occur between the number of fixture units attributable to the connection and the actual water demand or sewage generation expected. The city shall then have the authority to assess all connections according to that number of water supply or drainage fixture units or average daily flow that the city determines most accurately represents the expected water demand or sewage generation from the connection being assessed. In no case will the assessed value for water and sanitary sewer impact fees be less than one ERU per living or commercial unit with the exception of multifamily and mobile or modular homes in a park as has been stipulated hereinabove. Mobile or modular homes located outside of a park and on individual lots will be assessed the same as single-family units. Where existing structures are being renovated or modified, an additional impact fee may be assessed, according to the provisions stipulated hereinabove, should plans for such renovation or modification reveal additional water supply or sanitary sewer demand greater than that presently being served. 
(b)  Water and sanitary sewer installation charges are not included in the impact fee described in subsection (a) of this section and shall be paid directly to the city at the time actual service is requested for each hook-up. 
(c)  Impact fee rates shall be fixed by the city council by resolution. 
(Code 1988, § 17-188) 
Sec. 86-282. - Point of connection; generally. 
    The point of connection of the water or sanitary sewer facilities shall be where the city deems its system adequate to provide service. 
(Code 1988, § 17-189) 
Sec. 86-283. - Construction of water or sanitary sewer extensions. 
(a)  Construction by applicant. Upon request by the applicant and approval by the public works department, the applicant may engage an engineer to design and construct the required line extension. Design, construction and connection to the city's utility system shall be at the applicant's expense and shall be approved by the public works department in accordance with the appropriate policy, standards and specifications of the city. 
(b)  Construction by city. Upon request by the applicant, the city will cause to be constructed the necessary line extensions to the project. Upon receipt of such request, the city will advise the applicant of the estimated construction cost (including engineering, legal and administrative costs) and the estimated time of completion. The estimated design, legal and administrative costs will be paid to the city with the application. Payment of estimated construction costs will be required prior to initiating construction. Adjustment to be paid the city, or refunded to the applicant, will be made based upon final construction costs. 
(c)  Determination by city. The city shall determine which entity shall design and construct the line extension. 
(Code 1988, § 17-190) 
Sec. 86-284. - Designation of connection point. 
    Point of connection for all residential, industrial and commercial units shall be made by the property owner as designated by the public works director, unless specified exceptions are agreed upon by the city prior to issuance of building permits. 
(Code 1988, § 17-191) 
Sec. 86-285. - Oversizing of water or sanitary sewer extensions. 
    Where the city requires the oversizing of the extensions greater than the minimum city design standards, the applicant shall be so advised. All construction costs associated with oversizing the extension shall be borne by the city. On extensions by the applicant, the cost of oversizing shall be applied against impact fees. All costs for oversizing in excess of impact fees shall be borne by the city. Cost of oversizing shall be based upon the installed cost of the oversized extensions, less the city's approved estimated cost of the extension, sized in accordance with this article. 
(Code 1988, § 17-192) 
Sec. 86-286. - Line extensions by special assessment. 
(a)  Where water or sanitary sewer service is requested by individual property owners, either residential or commercial, in areas adjacent to existing city facilities having adequate capacity, involving potential future customers in addition to those requesting service, the city public works department will determine the feasibility of constructing the necessary line extensions, with payment to be by contract or special assessment, or other applicable provisions of law. Assessment of line extension costs shall be on a proportionate basis, in accordance with the front footage or anticipated flow associated with each property. All special assessments shall be approved by the city council at a properly advertised public hearing. Any assessments may be paid at the offices of the county tax collector within 30 days after the confirmation thereof, without interest. Thereafter, all assessments shall be payable in equal annual installments, with interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from the expiration of the 30 days, in each of the succeeding number of years for which the assessment will be payable as determined by resolution at the time in each year at which the general city/county taxes are payable; provided that the council may, by resolution, fix a shorter period of payment for any assessment or adjust the interest rate so as to preserve the interest rate on the principal amount of the assessment at or within one percent of the prime lending rate on the interest rate, not to exceed what is authorized by state statutes; further provided that any assessment may be paid at any time before due, together with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment. 
(b)  Impact fees associated with this type of service request will be required as stipulated in this article. Impact fee payment shall be made prior to connection to the facilities, or if requested by the applicant, and approved by the city council, may be included in the special assessment as outlined in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Code 1988, § 17-193) 
Sec. 86-287. - Service commitments. 
(a)  Acceptance of final review. Within 90 days of receipt of the final review, setting forth the impact fees, point of connection and extension requirements, the applicant for water or sanitary sewer service shall advise the city of the acceptance of the city's proposal. 
(b)  Development schedule. Along with the acceptance of the proposal, the applicant shall provide to the city public works department an estimated schedule of development, with the schedule showing the estimated number of units to be constructed yearly until completion. 
(c)  Formal commitment. Within two weeks after receipt of the applicant's notification of acceptance and development schedule, the city council shall cause a formal commitment letter to be issued. The commitment letter shall bind the city to provide services to the applicant, subject to receipt of impact fees payment. Commitments are nontransferable from one property to another, but commitments are transferable to a new owner of the same property. 
(d)  Expiration of commitment. Commitments shall expire four years after issuance of the formal commitment for projects involving lump sum payment. Commitments shall expire at the end of the last year indicated on the applicant's development schedule for projects involving incremental payment of impact fees. Commitments and proof of payment will be honored for any initial building permit issued by the county and/or the city. 
(e)  Time extensions to commitment or previous agreements. 
(1)  Time extensions to written agreements may be granted for periods not to exceed two years provided that capacity within the water or sanitary sewer system remains available and that a request is submitted in writing prior to 30 days before the expiration of the agreements. 
(2)  Service agreements or commitment contracts entered into prior to the effective date of this article, by which the city agreed to accept advanced impact fees and reserve capacity at its water or sanitary sewer treatment facilities, and by which the developer agreed to connect a certain number of units to the city facilities in accordance with an agreed upon schedule, may be granted two-year time extensions in accordance with subsection (e)(1) of this section. 
(Code 1988, § 17-194) 
Sec. 86-288. - Impact fee payments. 
(a)  Impact fee payment schedule, lump sum. Fees shall be paid either as a lump sum or in increments as provided for in this section. Impact fees shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of a building or remodeling permit, unless a specific incremental payment structure has been provided for by a utility service agreement. 
(b)  Incremental payments, other than single-family subdivisions. Upon execution of a utility service agreement, the applicant shall pay a minimum down payment equal to 50 percent of the total impact fee. However, if the city does not have the capacity to serve the applicant without expending public funds for new facilities, the entire impact fee must be paid upon execution of the utility service agreement. If a partial payment is allowed, the remaining balance may be paid by one of the following methods which will be incorporated into the utility service agreement. The applicant must provide an irrevocable letter of credit, surety bond or other instrument acceptable to the city, to guarantee payment of all fees to the city. 
(1)  If the remaining balance is $5,000.00 or less, it may be paid in two equal installments, with the first payment, along with a processing fee of $25.00, being made not later than 180 days after the initial payment on execution of the utility service agreement, and the last payment, along with a processing fee of $25.00, 360 days after the initial payment. 
(2)  If the remaining balance exceeds $5,000.00, it may be paid in four equal annual installments. Payments shall be made on the annual anniversary date of the execution of the utility service agreement, along with a processing fee of $25.00 per payment and interest at the rate of 18 percent per year on the unpaid balance. The applicant may pay the remaining balance, with interest prorated to date, at any time. 
(c)  Incremental payments, single-family subdivisions. Upon execution of a utility service agreement, the applicant shall pay a minimum of 20 percent of the total impact fee. However, if the city does not have the capacity to serve the applicant without expending public funds for new facilities, the entire impact fee must be paid upon execution of the utility service agreement. If a partial payment is allowed, the remaining amount may be paid on a per house basis as building permits are issued during the first 12 months, along with a processing fee of $25.00 for each payment, after receipt of the initial payment. An additional payment equal to 20 percent of the original balance shall be paid 12 months and one day after the execution of the utility service agreement. The remaining balance may be paid by one of the following methods which are deemed to be incorporated in the utility service agreement: 
(1)  If the remaining balance is $5,000.00 or less, the entire balance may be paid in full or it may be paid along with a processing fee of $25.00, 24 months and one day after execution of the utility service agreement. 
(2)  If the remaining balance exceeds $5,000.00, the total may be paid in full, or in four equal annual installments. If the balance is to be paid in installments, each payment shall be made on the annual anniversary date of the execution of the utility service agreement, along with a processing fee of $25.00 per payment and interest at the rate of 18 percent per year on the unpaid balance. The applicant may pay the remaining balance, with interest prorated to date, at any time. 
(3)  If fees are collected in excess of the total amount due, the city will return to the applicant any collections above the total amount due at such time as all lots are developed or all fees paid. 
(d)  Incremental payments-Alternative method for single-family subdivisions larger than 20 acres and for 50 or more dwelling units. For single-family subdivisions larger than 20 acres and for 50 or more dwellings units, an alternative method of making incremental payments may be used if incorporated into the utility service agreement. Upon execution of the utility service agreement, the applicant shall pay 20 percent of the total connection fees due. Thereafter, connection fees at the then current rate will be paid as each building permit is issued for construction within the development. The original 20 percent payment will remain on deposit with the city until applied or returned as provided herein. At any time that the amount on deposit is equal to or exceeds the connection fees due, at the then current rate, for the remaining development to be constructed in the subdivision, the deposit shall, at the request of the developer, be applied to make such payments and the remainder, if any, shall be refunded to the developer. If connection fees are not paid for all of the development in the subdivision within four years after the date of execution of the utility service agreement, any remaining deposit shall be applied, at the then current rate, to the payment thereof, and all unpaid connection fees for the remaining development shall become due and payable at the then current rate. Until such connection fees for the remaining development are paid, with interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from the four-year anniversary date of the utility service agreement, no utility service will be provided for any further construction in the subdivision. 
(e)  Expiration and refunds. Pursuant to this article, commitments on the part of the city to provide service will expire four years after final execution of the utility service agreement if construction has not commenced on the project by that date. After four years from execution of the utility service agreement, the city's commitment to provide service shall expire, as to any uncompleted portion of the project, if the development permit or building permit for the project is revoked or lapses. If the city commitment expires pursuant to this subsection, 50 percent of all impact fees paid for the uncompleted portion of the project, less processing charges and other expenses incurred by the city in contemplation of providing services to the project, shall be refunded to the applicant. 
(f)  Payment when connection of existing buildings is required. When connection of any existing building to the city's water or sewer system, or both, is required pursuant to section 86-41 or section 86-103, the impact fees for such building required to be paid under this article may be paid in five annual installments, the first being due one year after the required connection is made and the remaining installments being due on the same date of the next ensuing four years. Provided all such payments are timely made, no interest shall be owed on the installment payments. However, if any payment is not timely made, the owner of the lot or parcel for which the impact fees are due shall be obligated to also pay interest, at the rate of ten percent per annum on the entire impact fee or balance thereof until the entire amount is paid. 
(Code 1988, § 17-195; Ord. No. 638, § 1, 6-17-2002; Ord. No. 651, § 1(17-195), 3-17-2003; Ord. No. 653, § 2, 4-7-2003; Ord. No. 651-A, § 1, 1-23-2006) 
Sec. 86-289. - Impact fee/credit for construction costs. 
(a)  Upon application by a developer, up to 100 percent of water or sewer impact fees paid to the city may be applied against the cost of water or sewer line improvements made by the developer in excess of 300 feet, excluding extensions adjacent to property owned by the developer or located within the physical boundaries of the development, provided the pipe size is 12 inches in diameter or larger for water lines or gravity sewer lines, or eight inches in diameter or larger for sewer force mains, and provided at the time of approval the expenditure of the impact fees has not been previously committed to another developer pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  If the proposed water or sewer line extension route is conducive to future connections and the length of the extension is greater than 300 feet, excluding extensions adjacent to property owned by the developer or located within the physical boundaries of the development, the city may also offset the developer's off-site costs by contributing up to 50 percent of certain future water or sewer impact fees collected by the city. This payback provision applies only to direct connections made to the off-site water line extension within ten years of completion of the original extension. Connections of properties beyond the end of the water line extension are not subject to this payback provision. 
(c)  The total impact fee refund under this section shall not exceed: 
(1)  The actual amount paid by the developer for the off-site extension costs, including the cost of necessary off-site easements, minus any oversizing contributions paid by the city; or 
(2)  The total impact fees paid by the applicant. 
(d)  The city shall determine required line sizes. When the city has required the oversizing of lines or the installation of additional facilities in order to serve potential future developments or customers, the reasonable cost for such requirement may be reimbursed to the developer, after completion of the extension and connection to the city's system, through a refund of all or part of the impact fees paid to the city by the developer or through the payment to the developer of impact fees paid to the city by subsequent developers or customers connecting in the future to such extension, or by a combination of such refunds and payments. 
(e)  Where the city has agreed to participate in the off-site line construction extension costs through the payment to the developer of future impact fees relating to connections to such line extension by subsequent developers or customers, impact fees from such subsequent developers or customers shall be payable at the time of their application for service or at the time of their execution of a utility service agreement. Such fees will be first applied to any pre-existing applicable payback agreement before any repayment of a portion of any subsequent developer's line extension costs by the city. 
(f)  Line extension agreements will be reviewed and any refund payments due to developers from the city will be made annually. 
(Code 1988, § 17-196; Ord. No. 651, § 1(17-196), 3-17-2003) 
Sec. 86-290. - Impact fee revisions. 
    Any changes in regard to impact fees listed in this article shall be fixed by the city council by resolution at a properly advertised public meeting. Revised impact fees shall apply to commitments then in effect as follows: 
(1)  Commitments or agreements involving impact fees fully paid under the lump sum payment method or by construction cost refunds shall not be affected by the revised fee schedule until expiration of the commitment or agreement. If a time extension is granted upon expiration of the commitment or agreement, the new fees shall apply for all units in which building permits or hook-up of meters have not been issued. The applicant shall have the option of either paying the difference in impact fees for each connection made after expiration of the original commitment or agreement prior to issuance of a building permit or hook-up, or having the remaining unused impact fee balance applied toward a revised number of prepaid connections. 
(2)  Commitments or agreements involving impact fees paid under the incremental payment method shall be revised in the following manner:

(4)  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the city finds that any person has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4, regulated waters, Waters of the State or Waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

(6)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city.

(5)  AG agricultural district. The agricultural district is designed to promote and encourage the conservation and utilization of prime and productive agricultural land as well as the preservation of the open character of certain lands, which, by virtue of their topography, soil types, natural resources or relationship to other land use areas should be carefully reviewed and evaluated prior to their possible development.

PART 2-2 - ZONING DISTRICT USES 

Sec. 2-2.1. - Generally. 
    No building, structure or land shall be used, nor shall any use be established unless it complies with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(a)  Permitted principal uses. The purpose of listing the permitted principal uses contained within Table 2-2, Table of Allowable Uses, is to identify all principal uses that may be permitted on properties within each zoning district. 
(b)  Permitted accessory uses. Accessory uses are those uses which are customarily subordinate to, integrated with, and clearly incidental to a principal use on the same property. The Table of Allowable Uses identifies certain accessory uses that may be permitted within the zoning districts. 
(c)  Conditional Uses. Conditional Uses are those uses which require additional design standards to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The design standards supplement and are in addition to the standards and criteria otherwise required within this Code. Unless otherwise required herein, compliance with these supplemental standards shall be determined during development review and shall not require any additional procedural steps or review processes. 
(d)  Special Exception Uses. Special Exception Uses are uses and structures which may be permissible within each zoning district. The Special Exception Uses which are listed are considered to be uses which may be appropriate in a zoning district but require individual review as to their particular characteristics, impacts and location to determine if special conditions are necessary in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the City's residents. Requests for Special Exception Uses shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
(e)  Special Uses. Special Uses are uses and structures which would not be appropriate generally or without special study throughout the zoning district but which, if controlled as to number, size, location or relation to the neighborhood, would promote the public health, safety and general welfare. Requests for Special Uses shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. 
Sec. 2-2.2. - Allowable Uses. 
    The following table indicates the categories of uses which are allowable in each standard zoning district within the City of Brooksville. The categories of uses are arranged in the vertical column on the left side of the table and the zoning districts are listed across the top. "P" indicates that the use is permitted, subject to the standards of this Code. "C" indicates the use is a Conditional Use that may be allowed in the identified district pursuant to conformance with the design standards contained in Article IV. No public hearing is required for Conditional Uses. An "SE" designates uses as Special Exception Uses that may be established in the district, pursuant to a noticed public hearing as described in Article VIII and in conformance with the standards contained in Article IV. An "SU" designates uses as Special Uses that may be established in the district, pursuant to a noticed public hearing as described in Article VIII and in conformance with the standards contained in Article IV. An "A" indicates the use is an accessory Use that may be established in the district pursuant to the requirements of Article IV. A blank space indicates that the use is prohibited. All uses are subject to the development standards of the zoning district in which it is to be located as well as all other rules and regulations of this Code and the City of Brooksville. Properties with an overlay designation shall be governed by the underlying zoning district and may be permitted additional uses as indicated in the use matrix. 
    All uses are potentially permitted in planned development project (PDP) districts, subject to the policies of the comprehensive plan, the requirements of Article VIII of this Code and all other rules regulations and ordinances of the City of Brooksville. Land uses permitted in existing planned development project districts are specified in the PDP's conditions of approval. Requests for modifications to planned development projects are reviewed in accordance with Article VIII of this Code.

CITY OF BROOKSVILLE
HISTORIC CENTRAL BUSINESS/RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OVERLAY AREA

PART 3-2 - HISTORIC PRESERVATION 

Sec. 3-2.1. - Generally. 
    The architectural, cultural, archaeological, and historic artifacts of the City of Brooksville are important community resources which enrich the lives of citizens and visitors alike, provide expanded economic opportunity, and present opportunities to stabilize and enhance property values. Therefore, it is declared that structures, buildings, and sites important to the understanding of the history of the City of Brooksville possess special public interests and should be conserved and protected by designating them and their environs as historic and cultural conservation districts. 
    Within zoning districts now existing or hereafter created, it is intended to permit creation of historic and cultural conservation (HCC) overlay districts, in general areas having concentrations of structures of substantial historic, architectural or cultural significance, or for individual structures and premises designated as having such significance. 
Sec. 3-2.2. - Purpose and Intent. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the City of Brooksville historic preservation regulations is to establish procedures, as set forth in the Florida Certified Local Government Program, for the protection of the Historic and Archaeological Resources of the City of Brooksville. The regulations are to be read in accordance with the Florida Certified Local Governmental Guidelines. It is the express intention that these regulations implement the Florida Certified Local Governmental Guidelines. These procedures shall provide for the establishment of an historic preservation review commission to be known as the historic preservation review board (HPRB); the designation of landmarked historic and archaeological resources, landmark sites, and historic districts; the maintenance of the historic resources inventory; and the regulation of designated properties. These procedures shall comply with the Florida Certified Local Government Guidelines. 
    The architectural, archaeological, cultural, and historic artifacts of the City of Brooksville are important community resources which enrich the lives of residents and visitors alike, provide expanded economic opportunity, and present opportunities to stabilize and enhance property values. The structures, interiors, buildings, and archaeological resources important to the understanding of the history and archaeological history and prehistory of Brooksville possess special public interest and should be conserved and protected by designating them and their environs as landmarked historic and archaeological resources, landmark sites, and historic districts, hereafter referred to collectively as "landmarks." These regulations, the purpose of which is to preserve, promote, and improve the landmarks of the City of Brooksville, benefit the educational, cultural, economic, and general welfare of the public. 
    The City of Brooksville has played an important role in the development of Florida, and this history is shown today through its historic and archaeological resources. These landmarks represent the historical and archaeological activities of the community. 
    These regulations accomplish historic preservation through a three-step process. First, the regulations establish an HPRB made up of persons of knowledge, experience, judgment and background, and have personal or professional interest or experience in historic restoration and preservation. Second, the regulations provide for a process whereby the City Council will designate the historic and archaeological resources of the City as landmarks using the recommendations of the HPRB. Third, the regulations establish guidelines for the treatment of landmarks, especially involving exterior alterations and demolition of buildings and structures and the subsurface disturbance of archaeological resources. The HPRB may issue certificates of appropriateness (COAs) for changes to landmarks. 
(b)  Intent. Regulations relating to HCC districts are intended: 
(1)  To protect against destruction of such areas, structures, or features or encroachment of structures, uses, or features likely to have adverse effects on their historic, architectural, or cultural character; 
(2)  To encourage uses such as a bed and breakfast establishments, antique shops, book stores, cafes and other establishments in residential structures which will lead to their continuance, conservation, and improvement in a manner appropriate to the preservation of the cultural, architectural, and historical heritage of the City; 
(3)  To prevent developments in the visual environs of such areas or structures which would detract from their character; 
(4)  To ensure that new or altered structures and uses within such districts and their environs will preserve and enhance the special character of the districts; and 
(5)  To discourage unnecessary destruction of buildings, structures, and sites of special cultural, architectural, and historic importance. 
(6)  Foster such planning as to encourage the continued use and preservation of historic property. 
Sec. 3-2.3. - Regulatory Framework.

(2)  Members of the HPRB will be persons of knowledge, experience, judgment and background relative to the history of the City of Brooksville and Hernando County, and have personal or professional interest or experience in historic restoration and preservation. HPRB members will have the ability and desire to act in the public interest and represent, insofar as possible, the various special personal and professional interests required to make informed and equitable decisions concerning the preservation, conservation and protection of historic districts and structures. 
(b)  Term of office. 
(1)  HPRB members shall be appointed by City Council. The initial terms of four of the members appointed by City Council shall expire December 31, 2013 while the initial terms of the remaining three members shall expire January 1, 2014. Thereafter, the terms of all members will be two years. 
(2)  The term of a board member will be automatically terminated in the event a member fails to attend any three regularly scheduled meetings in any calendar year during the member's term of office. This provision does not include excused absences and special or emergency meetings. An HPRB member must notify the Community Development Department of expected nonattendance for an absence to be considered excused. 
(3)  Any member may be removed with or without cause by a majority vote of the City Council. Appointments to replace any member due to death, resignation or removal will be made by the City Council and will last for the unexpired term. 
(c)  Organization. 
(1)  The HPRB shall elect a chairman and a vice-chairman from its membership, and each will serve terms of one year. The board may elect the chairman and the vice-chairman for additional terms. The chairman will preside over the HPRB and will have the right to vote. In the absence or disability of the chairman, the vice-chairman will perform the duties of the chairman. The Chief Administrative Officer's designee shall act as the City historic preservation officer and will serve as staff of the HPRB. 
(2)  A majority of the board (four) will constitute a quorum. 
(3)  The board shall adopt rules and regulations providing for the transaction of its business and consideration of applications, for the time and place of regular meetings, and for the calling of special or emergency meetings. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public and a public record will be kept of the board's resolutions, proceedings, and actions as required by Florida law. 
(4)  The HPRB will hold regular meetings to consider nominations for designation of historic status, review applications for certificates of appropriateness, and conduct other such duties and business with which the board is charged under this ordinance. 
(d)  Historic and archaeological resource and landmark inventory. 
(1)  The City shall develop and maintain a listing of its landmarks and historic and archaeological resources considered eligible for landmark designation. This list, referred to as the historic resources inventory, shall be periodically updated and shall contain, but not be limited to, all City of Brooksville designated landmarks. The HPRB shall notify the owner(s) of the subject property of its intent to add historic and archaeological resources to the historic resources inventory. 
(2)  When applications for development permits, development orders or other development approvals affect properties listed in or properties abutting those listed in the historic resources inventory the City Department receiving the application shall provide the HPRB written notification within 15 working days after the deadline for filing of application for permits which require a public hearing. The Chief Administrative Officer or his designee shall request, obtain, and consider testimony from the HPRB. The HPRB shall give consideration to the views, if any, of interested persons. 
(3)  The HPRB shall review each application at its next regularly scheduled meeting provided that the HPRB receives notification of the application at least ten days prior to that meeting. If the HPRB does not receive notification of the application at least ten days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting, the HPRB will review the application at the following month's regularly scheduled meeting. Should the HPRB fail to act on an application within the above referenced time frame, it shall be deemed that the HPRB has no comment regarding the application. The applicant, or its representative, may attend the meeting at which the application shall be reviewed. 
(4)  The HPRB shall prepare a list of routine alterations, including minor work, which may receive administrative review from Community Development Department staff, provided that the alteration complies with the guidelines of the HPRB. In reviewing projects which may affect properties listed in or properties abutting those listed in the historic resources inventory, the HPRB shall apply the following criteria to determine whether or not the project will have either no effect or an adverse effect on the landmark and/or historic and archaeological resources: 
a.  A project has no effect on a landmark and/or historic or archaeological resource when the project proposes to preserve and protect those characteristics of the property that qualified, or may qualify the property for Landmark designation. For the purpose of determining effect, alteration of features of the property's location, setting, or use may be relevant depending on a property's significant characteristics and should be considered. 
b.  A project is considered to have an adverse effect when the effect on a landmark and/or historic or archaeological resource may diminish the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship or associated historic use. Adverse effects on historic or prehistoric cultural and archaeological properties and resources include, but are not limited to: 
 Physical destruction, damage, or alteration of all or part of the property; 
 Isolation of the property from or alteration of the character of the property's setting when that character contributes to the property's qualification for the landmark designation; 
 Introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property or alter its setting. 
Interior modifications that do not affect the exterior historical characteristics shall not be considered to have an adverse effect.

Article IV - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 
PART 4-1 - GENERALLY 

Sec. 4-1.1. - Contents. 
    This Article contains the general design standards and improvement requirements that apply to all development in the City of Brooksville. In some instances, however, the standards or requirements in this Article may be superseded by more specific standards or requirements associated with specific development scenarios addressed in other Articles of this Code. 
PART 4-2 - LOT ACCESS AND DIMENSIONS 

Sec. 4-2.1. - Lots-Measurement and Types. 
(a)  Lot width. The width of a lot shall be measured across the rear of the required front yard. The width of lots fronting on curves or culs-de-sac shall be measured as a straight line tangent to the midpoint of the arc of the curve formed by the building line. This building line may be equal to or greater than the required front yard of the zoning district. The building envelope for the smallest irregular shaped lot shall be shown on the preliminary plat. In addition, when a lot fronts on a culs-de-sac or curve, the lot width along the street frontage shall be measured as a straight line tangent of the midpoint of the arc of the curve along the street frontage and shall be a minimum of 20 feet. 
(b)  Lot types. Figure 4.1 illustrates terminology used herein with reference to corner, interior, and through lots. 
A - Through lots 
B - Corner lots 
C - Interior lots 
Figure 4.1 Lot Types

(c)  Lot frontage. 
(1)  On interior lots, the front of a lot shall be construed as the portion nearest the street. 
(2)  On corner lots, the frontage of a lot shall be construed as the shortest boundary to a street. If the lot has equal frontage on two or more streets, frontage shall be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee in accordance with the prevailing building pattern, or the prevailing lotting pattern, if a building pattern has not been established. 
(3)  On through lots, all portions adjacent to streets shall be considered as frontage for regulatory purposes. If the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee finds that the pattern of lots or the pattern of required yards, on lots adjacent to portions of the through lot, is such as to justify the elimination of the requirement that more than one frontage be provided on the lot, such additional frontage shall not be required. 
(d)  One dwelling unit per lot. For any district in which single-family residential uses are allowed, only one single family dwelling unit shall be permitted per lot unless otherwise allowed by this Code. 
(e)  Lot yards-Methods of measurement. The following rules shall apply with regard to determinations on yards on lots: 
(1)  Required yards adjacent to streets shall be of a depth as prescribed in district regulations with the depth measured as perpendicular to the street line or corridor reservation line, and the rear line of the required yard parallel to the street line or corridor reservation line. 
(2)  Front yards on interior lots shall be construed as extending between side lot lines across the frontage of the lot. 
(3)  Front yards on corner lots shall be construed as extending across the lot from each interior side lot line to the opposite street line. Corner lots are considered to have two front yards. 
(4)  Interior side yards shall be construed as running from the rear line of the required front yard to the front line of the rear yard, if required or, if no rear yard is required, to the opposite lot line. The width of a required side yard shall be measured perpendicular to the side lot line and the inner line of the required yard shall be parallel to such outer line, at the minimum distance therefrom prescribed in district regulations. 
(5)  Interior side yards on through lots with more than one front yard shall be construed as running to the rear lines of the front yards involved, and measurements and requirements shall be as for paragraph (4) above. 
(6)  On corner lots, the side yard is the yard along any interior lot line which intersects with a street lot line. When a corner lot has four sides, the two sides not adjacent to the streets are both side yards and the lot has no rear yard. If the corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along interior lot lines which do not intersect with a street lot line shall be considered rear yards and must meet the district regulations for such yards. In all cases the restrictions on maximum lot coverage and maximum impervious area must be met. 
(7)  Rear yards shall be construed as extending across the full width of the lot at its rear, except as stated in paragraph (6) above. Required depth of rear yards shall be determined in the same manner as required width of interior side yards. 
(8)  On through lots providing two front yards, and on corner lots (except as stated in paragraph (6) above), there will be no required rear yard, and yards other than those adjacent to streets shall be construed as side yards, as provided in paragraph (6) above. 
(9)  If an error is discovered in the location of a building or structure relative to the minimum yard requirements, or the lot is of a configuration atypical to the lots in the project as a whole, or the proposed building activity is to replace or repair structures destroyed or damaged during a declared natural disaster, as defined in this Code, the property owner, or their authorized representative, may file a request for an administrative review. The review of the request and the final decision shall be made by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee and shall be made in conformance with the following criteria: 
a.  The waiver shall not exceed more than ten percent of the required yard. 
b.  In the case of an error in yard measurements, the corresponding opposite yard must be larger than requested by the same distance as the waiver request (to insure that the waiver is not just an attempt to place a larger building on the lot) or the waiver request is an intrusion of only a small corner of the building (such as a house too close to the front of a culs-de-sac lot such that it violates the side yard requirements at the front corner but nowhere else). 
c.  In the case of an atypical lot configuration, the lot shall be a corner lot, culs-de-sac lot, lot with an unusual number of sides or some other configuration which makes it impossible to place a house or structure on the site which would be typically found in the development or the area. 
d.  In the case of replacement or repair of structures destroyed or damaged during a declared natural disaster, there shall be a physical impediment on the property, such as existing trees, which precludes compliance with the yard requirements. Additionally, the building activity shall commence within one year of the date of the disaster declaration. 
e.  Any waiver request which does not meet paragraphs a. and b., c. or d. above will be denied an administrative waiver and must comply with the yard requirements or seek a variance pursuant to Article VIII. 
(f)  Special yards. A special yard, for purposes of these regulations, shall be construed as a yard other than adjacent to a street, required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term "side yard" nor the term "rear yard," as generally determined, defined, or applied with respect to regular lots, fits the circumstances of the case. In such instances, the special yard shall be considered a rear yard unless the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee determines that side yard requirements for the district shall apply because of the relationship of the portion of the lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation of structures and buildable areas thereon. 
(g)  Permitted projections into required yards. 
(1)  Certain architectural features, such as cornices, eaves and gutters, may project no more than three feet into the required front yard, five feet into the required rear yard, and three feet or no more than 50 percent of the required side yard, whichever is the most restrictive. 
(2)  Other architectural features, such as bay windows, fire places and stairways, which may occupy a portion of a building footprint or extend from the building below the roof eaves, may project not more than three feet into required front and rear yards, three feet into side yards which measure a minimum of eight feet in width, and two and one-half feet into side yards measuring seven and one-half feet in width. No such intrusion is permitted into side yards less than seven and one-half feet in width. 
(3)  Mechanical equipment, such as air conditioning units, pumps, heating equipment, solar panels, and similar installations, may not project into the required front yard(s), but may project five feet into the required rear yard(s), and three feet or no more than 50 percent of the required yard, whichever is the most restrictive, into the required side yard(s). 
(4)  Covered patios, as defined by this Code, may intrude no more than 13 feet into the required rear yard and shall not intrude into the required side or front yards except as listed below. In no case shall the permitted intrusion of the covered patio reduce the yard provided to less than ten feet. 
(5)  For through lots, a covered patio may intrude 13 feet into the required front yard which functions as a rear yard and has no access to a street. In no case shall the permitted intrusion of the covered patio reduce the yard provided to less than ten feet. 
(6)  Patios enclosed by a screen-meshed structure without a solid roof that is attached to the primary building may intrude into required rear and side yards provided a minimum setback of three feet is provided. Such patios shall not intrude into required front yards except where a front yard functions as a rear yard and has no access to a street. In such cases, a minimum setback of three feet shall be required. 
(7)  In all residential districts, front porches, inclusive of architectural features such as cornices, eaves, and gutters, may project into the required front yard no more than ten feet or 50 percent of the required front yard setback whichever is less provided the following conditions are met: 
a.  The porch is open on all sides except where it is attached to the principal structure. The porch shall not be screened or otherwise enclosed. Railings if provided shall be consistent with the architectural style of the structure. 
b.  Any porch projecting into a required front yard shall have a minimum depth, as measured from the face of the building to the porch edge, of six feet and a minimum width of eight feet. 
c.  Second story porches may project into the required front yard consistent with the requirements above provided there is a first story porch located directly below the second story porch. 
(h)  Minimum lot area. Minimum lot area is the minimum square footage required for a lot by this Code. The minimum area shall not include submerged or environmentally sensitive areas. Roadways or rights-of-way provided by the owner or developer of the lot may be included with the zoning lot for the purposes of calculating density or floor area ratio and the minimum lot area for individual lots. If a zoning lot includes different zoning districts, the minimum lot area requirements for each district shall be met.

PART 4-4 - SUBDIVISION AND SITE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 4-4.1. - Generally. 
    All new development, subdivisions, streets, parking, lots, tracts and related improvements shall be developed and improved in accordance with the minimum standards and requirements set forth in this Code. The plans and specifications shall completely define the scope of all work to be accomplished in the construction of improvements and shall provide for a standard of quality which equals or exceeds the minimum requirements cited in the Hernando County Facility Design Guidelines, as issued by the Hernando County Engineering Department, the Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction, and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, State of Florida and the Hernando County Utilities Water and Wastewater Construction Specifications Manual. 
Sec. 4-4.2. - Development Regulations. 
(a)  Blocks. 
(1)  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to type of use proposed. 
b.  Zoning requirements. 
c.  Requirements for safe convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
d.  Topography. 
(2)  Block lengths shall not exceed 600 feet or be less than 330 feet unless specifically approved by City Council. 
(3)  Pedestrian crosswalks, designed to Florida Department of Transportation (F.D.O.T.) standards, shall be required where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities. 
(4)  Street rights-of-way shall be provided to all undeveloped areas surrounding the subdivision at points not to exceed 1,320 feet or such as the Planning and Zoning Commission may direct. Such rights-of-way may be left unimproved if desired by the subdivider and approved by City Council. 
(b)  Access. 
(1)  Every site developed under these site development regulations shall have access to a publicly-owned and maintained street or roadway. Access may be by a privately-owned and maintained street or roadway. 
(2)  All uses shall be provided with paved access to the nearest paved street or frontage road, as applicable. 
(3)  All uses shall be provided with paved driveways which extend from the edge of street pavement or frontage road to the property line. 
(4)  When access can be provided to a development by a collector facility, direct access to arterial roadways shall be restricted. 
(5)  All non-residentially zoned properties located adjacent to arterial highways shall provide a minimum 75-foot building setback from the arterial highway. The administrative official may reduce the 75-foot requirement and allow the minimum front yard setback of the property's zoning district in the following circumstances: 
a.  A hardship exists in the redevelopment of an existing developed parcel due to the inadequate depth of the property or the continued use of an existing structure. In such instances, cross-access driveways to adjacent parcels shall be provided when and where feasible. 
b.  The developer has provided for a reverse frontage road along the rear portion of the property. Any such exception may be subject to additional conditions. 
(6)  Access to residential property. Direct access from residential property adjacent to arterial streets shall be prohibited when access can be provided via a collector roadway, unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant that access to the arterial roadway will provide a greater public benefit. 
(7)  Primary access to non-residential property. With the exception of sites containing retail gasoline sales, there shall be only one vehicular access point, not to exceed 40 feet in width at the property line, or two vehicular access points at the property line, not to exceed 24 feet in width each, located on any one street or frontage road to serve the development. All vehicular access points shall be located at least 150 feet, or two-thirds the distance of the lot frontage, whichever is less, from the intersection of any right-of-way lines of streets or a street and a railroad and at least 15 feet from all side or rear property lines. 
No more than two vehicular access points, not to exceed 36 feet in width each shall be allowed for sites containing retail gasoline sales. All vehicular access points shall be located at least 75 feet from the intersection of any right-of-way lines of streets or a street and a railroad and at least 25 feet from all side or rear property lines. 
As provided in paragraph (6) above, adjoining projects may share a common driveway, provided that appropriate access easements are granted between or among property owners. If non-residential property is located such that access can be provided to either an arterial or collector facility, primary access shall be via the collector facility, unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant that primary access to the arterial roadway will provide a greater public benefit. 
(8)  Shared access. Shared access facilities onto arterial and collector streets are encouraged when two or more contiguous sites are planned for compatible uses. Shared access is desirable where the trip generation from the anticipated land uses will not be large enough to warrant a traffic signal. 
(9)  Prohibition of use of residentially-zoned private property for access to uses not permitted in residential districts. No private land which is agriculturally or residentially-zoned shall be used for motor vehicle access to land or structures in other districts used for any purpose not permitted in agricultural or residential districts. 
(10)  Off-site street parking. Except for single family residential units or other types of residential units approved by the City, off-site street parking shall be designed to ensure that all vehicles leaving or entering the public street right-of-way shall be traveling in a forward motion. 
(11)  Private roads designed to provide vehicular access to non-residential buildings and uses located in non-residential zoning districts shall not be permitted to be located in residential zoning districts. 
(c)  Streets. 
(1)  All new streets in the City of Brooksville shall utilize urban-type design features which reflect a "closed" drainage system including gutters, inlets and miami or raised curbs. Rural-type street design features which reflect an "open" drainage system including open swales shall not be permitted except to provide access to lots of one acre or greater. Design features and selection of drainage system type shall be approved by the Public Works Department Director. 
(2)  Access to adjoining property. Where street access to adjoining property is appropriate to accommodate traffic circulation objectives of the City, a street right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of such property and such right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as an unopened street. Upon formal determination that such unopened street is required for access to property, the developer of the property for which access is required shall be responsible for opening and improving the unopened street. 
(3)  Additional right-of-way. A proposed use or subdivision that abuts an existing street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements set forth in this Code shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way so that the minimum right-of-way required by these regulations can be established. The additional right-of-way shall be dedicated upon formal plan or subdivision approval, and shall be dedicated to the appropriate public entity. 
(4)  Street/access drive alignment. Street/access driveways shall be required to provide centerline alignment with existing centerline on the opposite side of the right-of-way. 
(5)  Horizontal and vertical curves. Horizontal and vertical curves shall be in conformance with Hernando County and/or FDOT standards. 
(6)  Improvements. Prior to granting of final approval, the subdivider/developer shall have installed or shall have furnished adequate bond for the ultimate installation of the following: 
a.  All streets shall be surfaced in accordance with applicable standard specifications referenced herein. 
b.  Curbs, gutters, drainage and drainage structures shall be provided in accordance with standard specifications referenced herein. 
c.  Permanent reference monuments (PRM) shall be placed at all block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and at intermediate points as required. PRM shall be consistent with F.S. ch. 177 and as approved by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee. 
d.  Sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all local, collector and arterial streets. Required sidewalks shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
e.  Street lights shall be installed. 
f.  Every effort to ensure the preservation of the historical brick streets of the City of Brooksville shall be taken. Any bricks removed from a street shall be saved and utilized for restoration efforts. Extensive care of these brick, in removing, storing, and replacing shall be taken at all times. 
(7)  Interconnected neighborhoods. Street layout shall be accomplished in a manner that connects development of the adjacent neighboring areas. Proposed streets shall provide satisfactory alignment for continuation of all existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. The street arrangements shall not cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access thereto. 
(8)  Cross-access criteria and requirements. The purpose of requiring cross-access in certain situations is to reduce the necessity to use the public street system in order to move between adjacent and complementary land uses where such interchange of vehicular or pedestrian trips are likely to occur. The provisions below shall not apply to developments required to provide frontage roads. 
a.  When each of the following conditions exist, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian cross-access must be provided: 
i.  The site has frontage on a public road. 
ii.  The site has a commercial land use or commercial or office zoning designation, and is adjacent to a parcel which also has a commercial land use designation or commercial or office zoning and which has access on the same roadway. 
b.  When each of the following conditions exists, provisions for pedestrian cross-access must be provided. 
i.  The site has frontage on at least one roadway. 
ii.  The site has a commercial land use or commercial or office zoning designation and is adjacent to a parcel having frontage on the same roadway which has a land use or zoning designation allowing 12 dwelling units per acre or more, or 
iii.  The site has a residential land use or zoning designation allowing 12 dwelling units or more per acre and is adjacent to a parcel having a land use or zoning designation of 12 dwelling units or more per acre or a commercial land use or commercial or office zoning designation and which has access on the same roadway. 
As used herein, "provisions for cross-access" shall mean that the developer of the property shall design his site in such a manner as to make cross-access possible as provided in this division. 
c.  When the criteria in paragraph i. or ii. above are met, provisions for cross-access must be provided as established below: 
i.  If the adjacent site is developed and, in the opinion of the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee, cross-access is feasible, the developer shall design and build the appropriate cross-access to the property line of the adjacent parcel. 
ii.  If the adjacent site is developed but, in the opinion of the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee, cross-access is not feasible at this time, the developer shall design and designate on the site plan the location of future cross access, but will not be required to construct the cross-access at the time of initial site development. The owner shall commit, in writing, to construct and allow cross-access at such time as the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee determines that cross-access is feasible and desirable. 
iii.  If the adjacent site is undeveloped, the developer shall design and build the cross-access to the property line of the adjacent parcel in anticipation of future connection when that site is developed. 
iv.  The minimum width of a vehicular cross-access shall be 24 feet. The minimum width of a pedestrian cross-access shall be five feet. 
(9)  Intersections. The intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near to the right angle as possible, and no intersections of streets at angles less than 70 degrees shall be approved. Street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of 20 feet measured at the back of curbs when such intersection occurs at right angles. Intersections with an angle other than a right angle shall be rounded with a curve of a radius acceptable by best engineering principles. 
(10)  Street right-of-way pavement widths and design speeds shall be no less than as follows: 
TYPE DESCRIPTION R/W LANE WIDTH DESIGN SPEED Alley One way traffic 20' 15' 20 mph Frontage Local Access 50' 12' 30 mph Local Open Drainage 60' 10' 30 mph Local Closed Drainage 50' 10' 30 mph Collector/2 Ln Open Drainage 80' 11' 40 mph Collector/2 Ln Closed Drainage 70' 11' 40 mph Collector/4 Ln Divided Open Drainage 140' 11' 50 mph Collector/4 Ln Divided Closed Drainage 100' 11' 50 mph Arterial/2 Ln Open Drainage 100' 12' 50 mph Arterial/2 Ln Closed Drainage 80' 12' 50 mph Arterial/4 Ln Open Drainage 200' 12' 60 mph Arterial/4 Ln Closed Drainage 150' 12' 60 mph  
(11)  Street grades shall conform to the Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction, and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, State of Florida on sight distance wherever feasible and shall not exceed the following, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves: 
a.  Arterial streets shall not exceed a six percent grade. 
b.  Collector streets shall not exceed an eight percent grade. 
c.  Local streets shall not exceed a ten percent grade. 
d.  Marginal access streets shall not exceed a ten percent grade. 
(12)  Intersections with arterial and collector streets. New street entrances, including frontage road ingress/egress locations, on roads designated or classified as arterial or collector shall be not less than 440/245 feet apart. 
(13)  Marginal access. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, City Council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alley, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(14)  Names and numbers. Address numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the addressing system in effect. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names within the City or county unless a new street is a continuation of or in alignment with the existing or platted street. Street names shall be subject to the approval of City Council. Street name markers which meet City specifications shall be installed by the developer at all street intersections. All new streets shall be named in the following manner: 
a.  Avenues shall run east and west. 
b.  Streets shall run north and south. 
(15)  Natural contours. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets; appropriate slope and gradient shall be utilized to eliminate potential erosion problems. 
(16)  Private streets. Private streets shall be discouraged, but may be permitted only when the use is limited to a single parcel or project and serves a general public need or purpose. 
(17)  Proposed extensions. Where feasible, proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the property included in a subdivision submitted for approval. 
(18)  Railroad on or abutting subdivision. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, City Council may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(19)  Dead-end streets. Permanent dead-end streets shall be permitted only when provided with a culs-de-sac at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway radius of not less than 40 feet, and an outside right-of-way radius of not less than 60 feet. Such dead-end streets shall not exceed 600 feet from the furthest point of culs-de-sac radius to the centerline of the closest intersecting street. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround area which shall meet the requirements above. 
(d)  Frontage roads and reverse frontage roads. 
(1)  Developers of properties adjacent to the major arterial highway grid must provide at the developer's expense a frontage road or reverse frontage road from property line to property line approximately parallel to the arterial highway upon demonstration of need and demand by the City. If the City does not determine need within ten years from the date the certificate of occupancy is issued for the current use, the developer may be exempted from this requirement by the City Council until such time as the impact from additional development, redevelopment or change of use on the site occurs. For purposes of this Section, the following roads in the City are classified for their entire length as arterial highways and are subject to the terms and provisions of this Section: 
 US 98; 
 US 41; 
 SR 50; and 
 SR 50A. 
(2)  The frontage road requirement may also be applied to collector roads for a distance of up to 600 feet from their intersection with an arterial highway, which will provide for greater safety by effectively looping frontage road traffic away from the intersection of the collector road and the arterial highway system. 
(3)  The frontage road is to be designed to City specifications established by the director of public works. The developer shall construct the frontage road segment at the time of site development, or, prior to issuance of a building permit, furnish to the City sufficient funds based on current cost estimates for the engineering and construction of the frontage road across the property when the City determines that sufficient length is available to construct a link in the frontage road system. 
(4)  All driveway cuts issued to developers of properties adjacent to arterial highways shall be considered temporary and subject to removal when the frontage road link is constructed across the property. 
(5)  Owners of property adjacent to arterial highways shall be required to obtain a City permit for driveway cuts to the property prior to and in addition to any state or federal permits. Application shall be made to the City agency established by the City Council for the enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Section. This City permit shall be sent to the state or federal agency as a recommendation from the City. 
(6)  All frontage roads created under the provisions of this Section shall be maintained by the property owner, upon whose property the road is constructed, in a passable condition to City standards established by the Public Works Department Director. The property owner may contract with the City to provide for the maintenance of the roadway, or dedicate the roadway and right-of-way to the City for inclusion into the City roadway maintenance system. If the dedication is accepted by the City Council, the property owner will no longer have the obligation to maintain the roadway. 
(e)  Stormwater management regulations. 
(1)  The drainage system for a new development, including subdivisions, shall be designed in accordance with sound engineering principles and procedures such that all useable parcels in the development are positively drained. The drainage system shall be designed to accommodate drainage from adjacent lands which naturally drain to or through the lands being developed. The drainage system shall be designed to not significantly affect the natural drainage onto adjacent lands unless appropriate agreements are obtained by the developer from the owner of such adjacent lands concurring in the proposed drainage design. Evidence of such concurrence shall be submitted to the City of Brooksville along with the development plans and specifications. 
(2)  All new commercial and office developments shall implement on-site stormwater management through low impact development techniques, such as grass swales, bio-retention areas, detention ponds, permeable pavers, rain barrels and cisterns. Design strategies shall be those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water's Low Impact Development Design Strategies: An Integrated Design Approach. 
(3)  Drainage facilities that are designed to handle flowing water (e.g., culverts, weirs, etc.) shall be hydraulically designed to function when subjected to the maximum flow rate that can be expected to occur no more often than once in ten years. 
(4)  Drainage facilities that are designed to handle water accumulations (e.g., retention ponds with no overflow provisions) shall be designed in accordance with Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) rules and regulations. Necessary drainage facilities including, but not limited to, culverts, rights-of-way and easements shall be dedicated to the City, at no expense to the City, and at the option of the City. The dedication shall include adequate rights-of-way or easements to permit proper maintenance operations. Areas required for maintenance shall be cleared of all trees and underbrush which would interfere with maintenance of the facility. 
(5)  Open drainage retention facilities with slopes of greater than four to one (4:1) shall be fenced. The fence shall be clad in green or black vinyl and shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Open drainage facilities with slopes of greater than four to one (4:1) and located in front of the principal structure shall be clad in green or black vinyl and shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Additionally, the fence shall be landscaped with evergreen vines, such as Confederate Jasmine, Coral Honeysuckle or Beach Elder. The vines shall be planted along the entire length of the fence, excluding gates, no more than six feet apart on centers. The vines shall be in three gallon containers, at a minimum, at the time of planting and shall have a minimum opacity of 75 percent within two years of planting. Fencing of permanent dry detention facilities shall not be required. 
(f)  Potable water system. A potable water distribution system shall be provided in all new subdivisions. The system shall be designed in accordance with federal, state and local standards. The public water systems shall be designed to provide fire flow and fire hydrants shall be placed in accordance with all applicable regulations and standards. New water lines shall not be located at the rear of platted lots unless otherwise allowed by the City's public works director. Connections to existing water lines shall be as directed by the City's public works director. 
(g)  Wastewater system. A wastewater system shall be provided in all new subdivisions. The system shall be designed in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local standards. New sanitary sewer lines shall not be located at the rear of platted lots unless otherwise allowed by the City's public works director. Connections to existing sanitary sewer lines shall be as directed by the City's public works director. 
(h)  Fire protection. Fire protection shall be provided in accordance with Florida Fire Prevention Code, latest edition. 
(i)  Underground utility service. All electrical power, telephone, cable and any other utility lines shall be installed in easements provided for along the appropriate property lines. Utility lines shall be installed underground. The pad mounted transformers for electric service shall not be located within the street right-of-way, unless authorized by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee. 
(j)  Easements. 
(1)  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least seven and one-half feet wide, each lot, or total 15 feet. 
(2)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming with the lines of such watercourse, with an additional 15-foot easement on each side for maintenance purposes. 
(3)  Easements shall not be established, conveyed, dedicated or otherwise utilized for the purpose of providing access to lots, tracts or parcels established after the effective date of this Code. However, the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee shall have the authority to require the developer to provide access easements to a lot or tract of record when such an access easement is necessary to provide legal access to such lot or tract.

(1)  Off-street parking required. In all districts, in connection with every industrial, commercial, institutional, residential or any other use, there shall be provided, at the time any new structure is erected, any use of a structure or land is enlarged or increased in density or intensity or any other use or change of use established, off-street parking spaces for automobiles in accordance with requirements contained in this Section. Conformance with the parking requirements herein shall be for the new use or portion of enlarged use or structures only and not the existing use or structure. 
(2)  Joint use facilities and shared parking. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more structures or uses. 
a.  An agreement for such joint use, in the form of a reciprocal easement shall be filed with the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee and recorded with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Hernando County. 
b.  No part of an off-street parking area or off-street loading area required for any structure or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Code, shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area or off-street loading area similarly required for another building or use, unless the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee determines that the periods of peak usage of such buildings or uses will not be simultaneous with each other. 
c.  All development orders or permits covering such approval shall include the requirements that the order or permit is valid only so long as the conditions described in the application for order or the permit exist. 
(3)  Compliance with regulations. The requirements for off-street parking space and off-street loading space applicable to newly erected or substantially altered structures shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of the real estate upon which any such structure is located, so long as the structure is in existence and its use requiring parking or loading, or both, continues. It shall be unlawful for an owner of any structures affected by this Code to discontinue, change or dispense with, or cause the discontinuance or change of the required vehicle parking or loading space apart from the discontinuance of such structure, without establishing alternative parking and loading space which meets the requirements of and is in compliance with this Code. 
(4)  Methods of providing required parking and loading. All required parking shall be located on the same zoning lot as the principal use(s) it serves, except as provided below. 
In lieu of actual construction of required on-site parking spaces, all or any portion of the off-street parking required for a use on a zoning lot may be located on another zoning lot, either by itself or combined as joint use or shared parking for other uses, subject to certification by the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee that the following requirements have been met: 
a.  The use being served by the off-site parking shall be a permitted principle use as established in Article II, in the zoning districts within which the zoning lot containing such parking is located; 
b.  The off-site parking spaces shall be located within 500 feet walking distance of a public entrance to the structure or land area containing the use for which such spaces are required. A safe, direct, attractive, lighted and convenient pedestrian route shall exist or be provided between the off-site parking and the use being served; 
c.  The continued availability of off-site parking spaces, necessary to meet the requirements of this Section, shall be ensured by an appropriate reciprocal easement, satisfactory to the City Attorney and recorded with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Hernando County;

e.  Required project improvements upon approval of the Chief Administrative Officer. 
f.  Permitted signs upon approval of the required site plan by the Chief Administrative Officer. 
(6)  Restricted uses within buffers. The following uses shall not be allowed within required buffer areas: 
a.  Off-street parking, loading, unloading service areas or vehicle circulation areas. In addition, all off-street parking spaces shall be provided with appropriate stops, curbs or other vehicle bumper guards designed to prevent any encroachment of vehicles upon the required buffer. 
b.  Barbed wire, electric fence or other potentially harmful objects or Articles. 
(7)  Mining considerations. For any mining application, landscape and buffer requirements shall be set by the City Council. The basis for determining required landscape and buffering shall at a minimum take into consideration site and ecologic conditions, extraction procedures, and the processing, storage and distribution systems to be used in resource extraction. In addition, conformance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 378 and F.A.C. ch. 16C-17 shall apply in determining landscape and buffer requirements. 
(Ord. No. 831, § 2, 8-6-2012) 
Sec. 4-5.8. - Single-Family Residential and Duplex Landscape and Tree Requirements. 
(a)  Single-family residential and duplex units shall be required to obtain a tree removal permit prior to any action to cut down, destroy, remove or move, poison or destroy through damaging, or authorizing the same, any living tree with a diameter of ten inches or greater. 
(b)  One tree, with a minimum one inch DBH, for each 5,000 square feet, or portion thereof, of lot area shall be required for all single-family residential or duplex land uses. 
(c)  Use of drought-tolerant (Xeriscape) landscaping (as defined by the Southwest Florida Water Management District's A Guide to Florida-Friendly Landscaping) is recommended in landscape design and construction. 
Sec. 4-5.9. - Penalties. 
    Violators of this Part shall be subject to code enforcement penalties set out in this Code. Any person or persons who remove a specimen or canopy tree without the required permit shall also be subject to providing replacement trees or contribute to the mitigation fund as required by this Article. In addition, no development permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued on lands where violations of this Part exist, until such time as appropriate corrective action is taken by the developer and approved by the City. 
PART 4-6 - FENCES AND WALLS 

Sec. 4-6.1. - Generally. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe standards for fences and walls for the conservation and protection of property, the assurance of safety and security, the enhancement of privacy and the improvement of the visual environment including the provision of a neat appearance in keeping with neighborhood character. 
(b)  Permit required prior to construction. Prior to construction, all fences and walls shall receive a permit in accordance with this Part and the permitting requirements in effect at that time. Applications for a permit shall be accompanied by a fee as set by the City Council. The City shall not inspect or approve the location of a fence or wall in regard to property boundary issues and is not liable for the legal location of the fence or wall. 
Sec. 4-6.2. - Regulations. 
(a)  Conformity to construction codes. All construction shall conform to Article X of this Code. 
(b)  General regulations for fences. 
(1)  Height shall be determined from the lowest point of average grade of the lots on either side of and immediately contiguous to the fence, to the average top elevation of said fence. Berms, when used in conjunction with fences, shall be included in height determinations. 
(2)  No fence exceeding two feet shall be constructed within the visibility triangle at roadway intersections. 
(3)  No fence shall impede or divert the flow of water through any drainage way unless by adequate investigation and approval from the City's Public Works Department Director, it is shown that the fence will not adversely impact any surrounding property owner and will contribute to an improvement in the overall drainage pattern. 
(4)  Fences shall be constructed in a workmanlike manner and shall be of sound and sturdy construction. Privacy fences shall be installed with the rails to the enclosed areas. The finished (smooth) side shall face rights-of-way or adjoining properties. All posts and support beams shall be placed on the unfinished side of the fence. This does not preclude the installation of post columns with spanning members of metal, wood, or other materials; in which case, the posts are equal in presentation to both sides of the fence. 
(c)  Regulations for required fences and walls. Required fences and walls shall be provided for buffering and screening purposes as provided in Section 4-5.7. Required fences and walls may be permitted up to six feet in height (or eight feet as permitted in (d)(1)g., h., and i. below) in front yards at the outer boundaries of the development or at the boundaries of distinct portions of the project (such as where multi-family adjoins single-family or commercial adjoins residential development) provided that: 
(1)  No drive or street pierces the wall except at development entrance/exit streets; and 
(2)  The fence or wall is approved by City Council as part of a planned development project district project or subdivision final plat. 
(d)  Regulations for fences and walls. 
(1)  Residential districts. 
a.  Fences and walls over four feet in height shall not be allowed within the required front yards, except as indicated in b., g., h. and i. below. 
b.  For corner lots, fences and walls up to six feet in height shall be allowed within a front yard which functions as a side yard, provided the fence or wall is located no more than ten feet into the required front yard, as measured from the required minimum front yard setback line. 
c.  For through lots, fences and walls up to six feet in height shall be allowed within one front yard which functions as the rear yard of the lot when the yard is adjacent to an arterial or collector road. 
d.  In general, the design of fences and walls shall be in keeping with neighborhood appearance. Fences may be constructed of commonly used materials such as chain link, masonry, wood or PVC. 
e.  In the HCBRD overlay district, fences located in the required front yard shall be plain or decorative wrought iron, rounded picket, pointed picket or split rail type. 
f.  The following materials shall be prohibited in the construction of fences and walls: house siding, scrap metal, second-hand materials not typically utilized for fences and other offensive materials. In addition, fences and walls in any residential district shall not contain any substance such as broken glass, spikes, barbs, nails, electronically charged wiring or similar materials designed to inflict pain or injury to any person or animal. These restrictions shall not be varied. 
g.  The maximum average height of any fence or wall shall be six feet, except as described in h., i. and j. below. 
h.  Fences and walls surrounding public utility structures within residential districts shall be exempt from the setback requirements and height requirements (up to a maximum of eight feet) and may use up to three strands of barbed wire on security chain link fences provided that such barbed wire is a minimum of six feet above average grade. 
i.  Walls, and combination walls and berms, up to eight feet in height, may be erected in yards which abut arterial streets or collector streets, provided that no access is provided to said arterial or collector and the fence is two feet or less in height within the sight visibility triangle. Column height shall be allowed as in k. below. 
j.  When a six-foot fence or wall height is required for the purpose of screening, height shall be measured from the finished grade at the minimum required setback or buffer line (whichever is greater) of the property which is required to provide the fence or wall. Notwithstanding, in no instance shall fence or wall height exceed eight feet nor be less than six feet measured from the finished grade immediately contiguous to the fence or wall. 
k.  Columns and posts, including decorative caps and finials, may exceed permitted fence height by a maximum of one foot. Columns and posts which exceed permitted fence height shall be not more than three feet in width and shall be spaced at least six feet apart. Additionally, averaging of fence height may be allowed under special circumstances, such as with a fence located on a slope, at the discretion of the Chief Administrative Officer or his designee. 
(2)  Agricultural districts. Fence and wall regulations shall be the same as for residential districts except as provided below. Additionally, on parcels with stables or bona fide agricultural operations, fences and walls up to eight feet in height shall be allowed in any yard, although fences and walls in required front yards shall not be more than 60 percent opaque above the height of four feet. Barbed wire fences and electrically charged fences may be allowed in agricultural districts subject to the requirements of applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations. 
(3)  Commercial and office districts. In commercial and office districts, fence and wall regulations shall be the same as for residential districts, except fences in the C-2 or CIS-1 districts. In these districts, fences and walls shall conform to the requirements for fences and walls in residential districts except that six-foot chain link security fences (with 30 percent or less opacity) shall be allowed within any yard. 
(4)  Industrial districts. 
a.  The maximum height of fences and walls shall be eight feet. 
b.  Within front yards, solid fences and walls (i.e., fences or walls with greater than 30 percent opacity) shall be restricted to a height of four feet. 
c.  Barbed wire and electrically charged fences may be used if all requirements of all applicable local, federal and state laws and regulations are met. 
PART 4-7 - INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

Sec. 4-7.1. - Generally. 
    Manufacturing, processing and assembly operations shall observe the following performance standards. Proof shall be provided that all required permits for particular discharges can be met. Since zoning compliance does not substitute for requirements of other agencies, all necessary environmental permits shall be obtained. 
(a)  Lighting. Lighting shall be in accordance with subsection 4-4.2(m) of this Code. 
(b)  Sound. 
(1)  Receiving use: Residential. Sound levels shall not exceed the following standards if the receiving use is residential: 
 60 dBA between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
 55 dBA between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(2)  Receiving use: Commercial. Sound levels shall not exceed the following standards if the receiving use is commercial: 
 65 dBA between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
 60 dBA between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(3)  Receiving use: Industrial. Sound levels shall not exceed 75 dBA at any time if the receiving use is industrial. 
(c)  Vibration. Vibration levels shall not exceed the following standards: 
Maximum Peak Particle Velocity 
Steady state 0.02 inches/second 
Impact 0.04 inches/second 
Note: The maximum particle velocity shall be the maximum displacement vector sums of three mutually perpendicular components, recorded simultaneously, multiplied by the frequency in cycles per second. For purposes of this Code, steady-state vibrations are vibrations which are continuous, or vibrating in discrete impulses more frequent than 60 per minute. Discrete impulses which do not exceed 60 per minute, shall be considered impact vibrations. 
(d)  Airborne discharges. Airborne discharges shall be minimized so as to not cause or contribute to an objectionable odor off the operator's property. For the purpose of this Code, objectionable odor shall be defined as the property of a substance which materially offends the sense of smell of a considerable number of persons of the public. 
(e)  Dust. Dust discharges from the operator's property shall be minimized by taking reasonable precautions to include but not limited to: paving and maintenance of roads, parking areas and yards; periodic application of water or chemicals to unpaved roadways and open stock piles; landscaping of yards; use of hoods, fans, filters, and other similar equipment to capture the dust; and use of wet abrasive blasting equipment (when possible) where abrasive blasting is necessary. 
(f)  Measurement provisions. All measurements to determine compliance shall be made at the nearest boundary of the zoning district to the use being evaluated. 
PART 4-8 - SUPPLEMENTAL DESIGN STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL USES 

Sec. 4-8.1. - Generally. 
(a)  Conditional Uses contained in this Part have been determined to require additional design standards to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The standards described for each use below shall supplement and be in addition to the standards and criteria otherwise required within this Code. Unless otherwise required herein, compliance with these supplemental standards shall be determined during development review and shall not require any additional procedural steps or review processes. 
(b)  Special Exception Uses contained in this Part shall be considered and approved, approved with conditions, or denied in accordance with the requirements of Article VIII for the issuance of development orders. Changes to previously approved Special Exception Uses contained in this Part shall also be considered and approved, approved with conditions or denied in accordance with the requirements of Article VIII for the issuance of development orders. The Special Exception Uses contained in this Part may only be permitted upon demonstration of compliance with all of the requirements of this Part. 
(c)  Special Uses contained in this Part shall be considered and approved, approved with conditions, or denied in accordance with the requirements of Article VIII for the issuance of development orders. Changes to previously approved Special Exception Uses contained in this Part shall also be considered and approved, approved with conditions or denied in accordance with the requirements of Article VIII for the issuance of development orders. The Special Exception Uses contained in this Part may only be permitted upon demonstration of compliance with all of the requirements of this Part. 
(d)  To determine if a use contained in this Part is a Conditional, Special Exception or Special Use, refer to Table 2-2. 
Sec. 4-8.2. - Accessory Dwelling Standards. 
(a)  The accessory dwelling shall be located on a conforming residential lot. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in a planned development project, a minimum lot area of 7,000 square feet shall be required. 
(b)  The residential lot shall be occupied by a principal detached single-family dwelling that is owner occupied. 
(c)  Living space in the accessory dwelling shall be limited to a maximum of 900 square feet. For purposes of this regulation, living space shall include all areas within the dwellings utilized for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, bathing, washing, sanitation, laundry and storage purposes. Notwithstanding the above, living space shall not include motor vehicle garages and attics, provided such areas are not conditioned and are utilized solely for parking and storage purposes, and covered patios as defined by this Code. Living space shall be measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls. 
(d)  The accessory dwelling may be a detached structure or attached to the principal single-family dwelling on the lot. Detached accessory dwelling units shall, at minimum meet accessory structure setbacks rather than principal structure setbacks. Total building coverage on the lot shall not exceed district standards. 
(e)  The accessory dwelling shall be located on the same lot as the principal dwelling. No more than one accessory dwelling unit shall be permitted on the lot. These requirements shall not be varied. 
(f)  Any detached structure, or any portion of a structure or dwelling that cannot be accessed internally from within the structure or dwelling, which does not meet the requirements for an accessory dwelling as described in this Code shall not be utilized for living or sleeping purposes, including guest visits, at any time. 
Sec. 4-8.3. - Accessory Retail. 
(a)  All accessory uses shall be located wholly within a structure containing a Permitted Use. 
(b)  Not more than one exterior public entrance shall be permitted to serve the accessory use. 
(c)  Accessory uses shall not individually occupy more than 20 percent of the floor area of the total Permitted Use and all accessory uses in the structure shall not collectively account for more than 20 percent of the total floor area. 
(d)  Parking shall be calculated as if the entire site were developed for the principal use. 
Sec. 4-8.4. - Accessory Structures. 
(a)  Generally. Accessory structures shall conform to the following regulations, except as may otherwise be provided in this Code. Accessory structures do not include accessory dwellings as regulated by this Code. Accessory structures shall not be utilized for living or sleeping purposes, including guest visits, at any time. 
(b)  Height. Accessory structures shall not exceed 15 feet in height, except 1) where the accessory structure meets the primary structure setback of the district, in which case the maximum height of the accessory structure may be that of the district, or 2) accessory agricultural structures such as barns and silos (See subsection (d) below). 
(c)  Location. 
(1)  Accessory structures shall not be erected in any required front yard except as outlined in subsections (4), (5) and (6) below. Accessory structures shall be permitted in front yards at twice the depth of the required front yard, or 50 feet, whichever is less. Such structures shall not occupy required side yards. 
(2)  Accessory structures may occupy required side yards provided that such structures are more distant from the street than any part of the principal building on the same lot and any lot abutting said required side yard; provided, however, that such accessory structures are not closer than three feet from any side lot line, including architectural features such as cornices, eaves and gutters. 
(3)  Accessory structures may occupy required rear yards provided that such structures do not occupy more than 20 percent of the required rear yard, excepting swimming pools and swimming pool screened structures, and are not closer than three feet to any rear lot line. 
(4)  On any corner lot no part of any accessory structure shall be located in the required front yards except where one front yard functions as a side yard. On these lots, accessory structures shall be permitted to intrude up to ten feet into the required front yard functioning as a side yard. In zoning districts which require side yards greater than ten feet, the permitted intrusion shall be increased up to a distance equal to said required side yard. The intrusion is measured from the required yard line, toward the street. 
(5)  On corner lots which do not have a required rear yard, accessory structures may be located in the functional rear yard (the area behind what is designed to be the rear of the house) provided the accessory structures meets all other requirements. 
(6)  Through lots may have accessory structures located in the front yard that functions as a rear yard provided that any accessory use or structure of a height greater than two feet shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the front yard which functions as a rear yard. 
(d)  Agricultural structures. Accessory agricultural structures shall not be limited to a maximum height, but shall be set back from the zoning lot line as follows: 
(1)  An agricultural accessory structure 15 feet or less in height shall be located a minimum of three feet away from the side and rear zoning lot line and shall not be located in a required front yard. 
(2)  An agricultural accessory structure over 15 feet up to 51 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of one additional foot from the side and rear zoning lot line (in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1) immediately above) for every three feet of increased height up to 51 feet. Therefore an agricultural accessory structure 45 feet in height shall be located a minimum of 13 feet from the zoning lot line. Said agricultural accessory structure shall not be located in a required front yard. 
Sec. 4-8.5. - Adult Care Facility. 
(a)  Adult care facilities shall be permitted without regard to subsequent standards set forth in this Section if such uses are accessory to the following Permitted Uses: churches, social service agencies, health care facilities, community centers, or elderly housing developments. Said adult care facility uses may be on a lot with the aforementioned Permitted Uses, or on an adjoining lot, may be a part of the principal structure, or may be housed in a second structure on such lots. 
(b)  The location and extent of the facility shall not adversely affect the character of the existing neighborhood. The adult care facilities not governed by Section 4-8.5(a) shall be located in a building that is in scale with the buildings located within 200 feet of said building. Said adult care facility buildings shall not deviate by more than 30 percent from the median scale of neighboring buildings as determined by site volume ratio and total building volume. 
(c)  No overnight lodging shall be permitted for any type of adult care facility. 
(d)  Adult care facilities with a capacity of ten or less individual may be requested in any zoning district. Those with a capacity for accommodating 11 to 25 individuals may be located in residential districts no more than two lots distant from the boundary of a non-residential zoning district. Those adult care facilities with a capacity of more than 25 individuals shall be located contiguous to at least a collector roadway. 
Sec. 4-8.6. - Adult and Sexually Oriented Businesses. 
(a)  Purpose and findings. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this Article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this Article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this Article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
(2)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres , 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S. 697, (1986); California v. LaRue , 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky , 479 U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga , 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap City , 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington , 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); ILQ, Inv. Inc. v. City of Rochester , 25 F.3d 1413 (8th Cir. 1994); Z.J. Gifts, L.L.C. v. City of Aurora , 136 F.3d 683 (10th Cir. 1998); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami , 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984), as well as studies conducted by other local governments, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the City Council finds that: 
a.  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often not effectively controlled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no adequate mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
b.  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas. 
c.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue , 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
d.  Offering and providing such booths or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
e.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
f.  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Myers, Florida. 
g.  For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 523,056. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
h.  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in Florida. 
i.  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the ten-year period 1985-1995 was 367,796. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
j.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported during the period 1993-1995. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
k.  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
l.  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
m.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
n.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
o.  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre , 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991). 
p.  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap City , 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986). 
q.  Location of sexually oriented businesses proximate to residentially zoned property has an adverse effect on property values and leads to deterioration of neighborhoods and community blight. See the St. Paul, Minnesota, and Indianapolis, Indiana, studies in particular and the findings approved in ILQ, Inv. Inc. v. City of Rochester , 25 F.3d 1413 (8th Cir. 1994); and Z.J. Gifts, L.L.C. v. City of Aurora , 136 F.3d 683 (10th Cir. 1998), for example. Location of such businesses proximate to religious establishments, schools, parks, licensed day care centers, and other areas or establishments frequented by families and children pose particular issues of safety and concern in view of the previous findings herein. 
r.  The findings noted in subsections (a)(2)a. through (a)(2)q. of this Section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
s.  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
t.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
u.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the unlawful and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
v.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
w.  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this Article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
x.  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this Article. 
y.  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
z.  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this Article. 
aa.  Substantial case law from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, as applicable to Federal Court jurisdiction in Florida, supports the validity of a licensing ordinance with provisions similar to those contained herein based on findings of the type cited in this Section. 
(3)  Conclusions. 
a.  It is the finding of the City Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
b.  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The City Council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions would result in the City as well. 
c.  The City Council therefore concludes that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments. Therefore, the City Council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment. The City Council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions, and further finds that such regulations will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. 
(b)  Classification. Sexually oriented businesses are classified as follows:

Article V - NATURAL RESOURCES 
PART 5-1 - GENERALLY 

Sec. 5-1.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the natural resources regulations is to set forth regulations regarding land alteration, the protection of soil and water, and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas, in order to maintain the quality of life in the City of Brooksville and protect the health, safety, welfare and general well being of the citizens of the City of Brooksville. 
PART 5-2 - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

Sec. 5-2.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
    Wetlands contiguous to waters of the state, and non-contiguous and isolated wetlands serve important functions in the hydrologic cycle and ecological system and therefore require protection. It is the purpose and intent of this Section to provide for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of wetlands within the City of Brooksville in accordance with the adopted comprehensive plan, recognizing the rights of individual property owners to use their lands in a reasonable manner as well as the rights of all citizens to protect and purify the waters of the City of Brooksville and their associated wetland ecosystems. Wetlands shall include natural water bodies, freshwater marshes, wet prairies, hardwood swamps and cypress swamps. 
Sec. 5-2.2. - Generally. 
(a)  All development shall comply with wetland protection requirements of all federal, state and regional agencies having regulatory authority. 
(b)  In order to properly identify and delineate wetlands prior to development, the City shall rely on the delineation of wetlands and surface waters by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). This delineation shall be reproduced on construction plans which are submitted for review by the City. For other review purposes which do not specifically permit development, (e.g. rezonings, etc.) the areal extent of onsite wetlands shall be estimated and no delineation is required unless specifically required by the City. 
Sec. 5-2.3. - Activities Allowed. 
(a)  Existing uses in wetlands may continue, but shall not be expanded unless they are explicitly allowed, permitted or exempted by the current SWFWMD regulations and/or as indicated in subSection (b) below. Existing silviculture in wetlands shall be consistent with "Silviculture Best Management Practices" published by the Florida Department of Agriculture, 1998. 
(b)  New development which will have no significant impact on the net wetland functions will be allowed, including: 
(1)  Water dependent uses as defined by 9J-5.003(137) F.A.C. 
(2)  Walking trails or elevated wooden boardwalks designed to minimize disturbance to the wetland system shall be allowed to provide limited access for purposes of passive recreation or access to other portions of the site or adjacent waters which are otherwise inaccessible. 
(3)  Insect control structures. 
(4)  Temporary impacts associated with the installation of cables, conduits and pipelines that transmit electricity, communication signals, potable water, raw water, reclaimed water, domestic wastewater, propane gas, or natural gas. 
(5)  Minor activities by FDOT, the City of Brooksville, and Hernando County within existing ROW or easements. 
(6)  Exemptions listed in 40D-4.051, together with projects described in SWFWMD 40D-4.054, 40D-40.040, and 40D-400. 
(7)  Environmental restoration, enhancement, and research uses. 
(8)  Uses that require the dredging and filling of less than 100 square feet of wetlands. 
(c)  Road crossings shall be allowed to access developable portions of the development parcel or if shown to be in the overriding public interest (e.g. as necessary local, collector or arterial road linkage). When allowed, road crossings shall occur at the narrowest practical point given the constraints of safe roadway design and shall provide for hydrologic connectivity and aquatic species movement. 
Sec. 5-2.4. - Activities Prohibited. 
    Land alteration activity which destroys, reduces, impairs or otherwise adversely impacts a wetland or natural body of water shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the above or by the SWFWMD. New lots shall not be created and/or platted that do not contain sufficient buildable upland areas in order to provide a reasonable use for the lot. 
Sec. 5-2.5. - Development Provisions. 
(a)  When wetlands are identified on a site and mitigation is not approved, new development (other than listed in Section 5-2.3 above) shall be clustered away from the wetlands on upland portions of a development site. Development densities/intensities may be transferred out of the undeveloped wetland areas on a one-for-one basis. However, the development density and intensity of the developed portion of the site shall not exceed 150 percent of the maximum density/intensity of the remaining uplands that would be otherwise allowed under the property's future land use designation. 
(b)  If the extent of wetlands on an individual development parcel would prevent the use of the parcel as allowed by the future land use map designation and which meet the following applicable criteria, the following densities and intensities shall be allowed: 
(1)  For wetland areas less than 20 acres, a single family residence that is not part of a larger plan of common development proposed by the applicant, including associated residential improvements such as a driveway, garage and an on-site sewage disposal system, not to exceed 6,000 square feet. Structures must be elevated when possible to minimize wetland impacts. 
(2)  For wetland areas exceeding 20 acres, residential uses at a density of one dwelling unit per 20 acres. 
(3)  Non-residential uses allowed by the future land use category when elevated above the wetland on pilings and having less than 1,000 square feet of floor space per acre. 
Sec. 5-2.6. - Wetland Buffers. 
(a)  Buffer areas shall be provided adjacent to wetlands. Buffers shall be a average minimum width of 25 feet beyond the perimeter of the wetland with a minimum width of 15 feet, excepting the point where permitted water conveyance facilities connect to the wetland. Buffers shall not be developed, cleared or landscaped in any fashion that would decrease their effectiveness in supporting wetland functions. Encroachment into the wetland buffers for the purpose of hydrologic connection of drainage systems and creation of mitigation areas shall require no further buffering compensation. 
(b)  The City may require that upland buffers be extended beyond 25 feet if necessary to connect isolated wetlands with other protected wetlands existing within 100 feet, depending on the existence of listed species and habitat valuation. Greenways will be created when possible. 
Sec. 5-2.7. - Mitigation. 
    The purpose of mitigation is to offset environmental impacts. Mitigation activities approved by a federal, state or regional agency are supported by the City. However, the issuance of a permit by any other agency, with or without mitigation, does not exempt the development from the requirements and restrictions of this Article. 
Sec. 5-2.8. - Implementation. 
(a)  A generalized wetlands map is provided in the City of Brooksville Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Wetlands that exist on a proposed development parcel shall be shown by the landowner/developer as a part of the construction plans submitted to the City for review of the proposed project. Additionally, this map must show the delineation of the upland buffer for projects which do not require a SWFWMD permit. For projects requiring a SWFWMD permit, the City shall require as a condition of development approval that wetland buffers shall be protected. 
Sec. 5-2.9. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Isolated wetlands: 
(1)  Development may incorporate isolated wetlands into stormwater management systems, provided that the stormwater runoff is pre-treated prior to entering any the wetland, so that the wetland is used for nutrient and volume attenuation. The City shall encourage designs which maintain the existing natural wetlands community, except where permitting agencies agree that the imposition of conditions which favor a different plant community are more desirable for the purpose of providing habitat, improving water quality or enhancing other wetland values. 
(2)  The City shall request that the SWFWMD or a professional biologist comment and render an opinion as to whether the wetland has significant wildlife values based on the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the isolated wetland acts in concert with the broader regional landscape to provide both food web support and habitat for wildlife; 
b.  The potential cumulative impacts to isolated wetland wildlife functions at a regional level; 
c.  Individual wetland features that are important to wildlife; 
d.  Whether the isolated wetland is used by endangered or threatened species or species of special concern; and 
e.  The degree to which adjacent existing or planned development will affect the use of the wetland by wildlife. 
If the biological evaluation indicates that the isolated wetland has significant and sustainable wildlife values, the wetland shall be afforded the same level of protection as all other wetlands. However, if the report indicates no significant and sustainable values, then the property's zoning designation shall be applied. This does not preclude the application of any regulatory requirements of other federal, state or regional agencies. 
(b)  Wetland buffers. Buffer widths shall be a minimum of 15 feet excepting permitted water conveyance facilities, and may only be adjusted downward to below a minimum average of 25 feet on a case-by-case basis if the following conditions are present: 
(1)  The developable portion of existing lots of record as of the date of adoption of this ordinance does not have sufficient size or dimensions to allow for a reasonable use of the property based on the property's zoning. In this instance, the remaining buffer shall be enhanced with native species to minimize development impacts. 
(2)  The proposed development shall provide mitigation for reduction in standard by enhancing the functioning value of the wetland buffer area. 
(c)  Degraded wetlands. If the SWFWMD indicates that a wetland (or a portion thereof) is severely degraded and has minimal restoration potential and that beneficial restoration or enhancement mitigation of another wetland would be achieved as a result of mitigation that allows some development in this degraded wetland (or portion thereof) then the property's zoning district designation shall apply. Mitigation shall be permitted with the first priority being mitigation on-site, the second priority being mitigation within the City limits, and the third priority being mitigation within Hernando County under City/county interlocal agreement.

PART 5-4 - WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 5-4.1. - Endangered or Threatened Species. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this Part to provide standards necessary to protect the habitats of species, both flora and fauna, of endangered, threatened, or special concern status in the City of Brooksville. It is the intent of this Part to require that an appropriate amount of land shall be set aside to protect habitat of rare, endangered, or special concern plant and animal species. 
(b)  Applicability. For all new development projects of 20 or more acres in size, the review process shall include a request by the City of Brooksville to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for an assessment of known or potential impacts upon threatened or endangered species or their habitat. 
Sec. 5-4.2. - Wildlife Management. 
    In the event that threatened or endangered species are identified as provided above, a habitat management plan shall be provided. The habitat management plan shall be prepared by an ecologist, biologist or other related professional and employed by the applicant in cooperation with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. The plan shall document the presence of affected species, the land needs of the species that may be met on the development site, and shall recommend appropriate habitat management and other measures to protect the subject wildlife. A wildlife management area shall be established, of a size adequate to maintain a viable population of the affected species. 
(a)  On-site wildlife management. The size of the habitat area shall be established by a wildlife biologist employed by the developer in cooperation with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. The habitat area may be retained for use as passive open space and an integral part of the development, or it may be conveyed to public or private, non-profit use. As an incentive to developers, any undeveloped area development rights may be utilized on the remaining portion of the development, at a rate equal to 1.5 times the intensity of use that would have been allowed if the habitat area were not reserved. 
(b)  Off-site wildlife management. In the event that an acreage adequate to maintain a viable population of the affected species cannot be provided on-site, several options are available as follows: 
(1)  The developer may, conditional upon approval of the affected state and federal agencies, relocate the affected population to a suitable public habitat off-site which such habitat is inadequately stocked with the affected species; or 
(2)  The developer may purchase an alternative site which is potentially suitable for the affected species but currently lacking one or more features essential for suitable habitat, create a suitable habitat pursuant to a wildlife management plan approved by City Council, and relocate the affected species at such time as the habitat becomes suitable. 
(3)  Pay a fee to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, at a rate to be established by that agency, for the commission to acquire an alternative site, improve the site and relocate the affected species. 
PART 5-5 - FLOOD PREVENTION AND PROTECTION AREAS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 831, § 1, adopted October 6, 2012, repealed the former Part 5-5, §§ 5-5.1-5-5.7, and enacted a new Part 5-5 as set out herein. The former Part 5-5 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 826, adopted October 17, 2011. 

Sec. 5-5.1. - Generally. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this Part is to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community Participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(b)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. These regulations are intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(c)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Part and the Florida Building Code, as amended, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring these regulations be revised to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this Part. The regulations contained herein shall not create liability on the part of the City or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(c)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The flood insurance study for Hernando County dated February 2, 2012, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of these regulations and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Brooksville Community Development Department. 
(d)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to Section 5-5.5 of this Part the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the City indicates that ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this Part and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(2)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(e)  Other laws. The provisions of this Part shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This Part supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the requirements of the more restrictive shall govern. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this Part. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Part, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

The construction board of adjustment and appeals or similarly designated body has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of these regulations. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in Section 5-5.5(c) of this Part. 
(d)  Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this Code, provided the variance meets the requirements of Section 5-5.7(c), is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(f)  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the construction board of adjustment and appeals or similarly designated body shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this Code, and the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
(5)  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(g)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this Code or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the construction board of adjustment and appeals or similarly designated body that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Article VI - ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITIES 
PART 6-1 - GENERALLY 

Sec. 6-1.1. - Intent and Purpose. 
    It is the intent of this Article to establish minimum criteria for the concurrency management system and authorize the preparation of an administrative procedure for determining that public facilities and services meet or exceed the adopted level of service standards set forth in the City of Brooksville Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 6-1.2. - Capacity Review and Certificates of Concurrency. 
(a)  Available capacity review. 
(1)  In order to determine if an application for a rezoning, Special Use or Special Exception is consistent with the provisions of the comprehensive plan, an available capacity review may be conducted by the City. This procedure is a review and does not constitute a binding determination by the City. 
(2)  The following public facilities will be reviewed for adequacy to serve the subject site: potable water, sewage treatment, drainage, solid waste, parks and recreation facilities, public schools and transportation: 
a.  For potable water, sewage treatment, drainage, solid waste, parks and recreation facilities, and transportation, where capacity will not be available to serve the property seeking a development permit and alternative mitigation is not available or agreeable, then the City may use the lack of such infrastructure capacity as a basis for denial of the development permit. 
b.  For public schools, where capacity will not be available to serve students from the residential property seeking a development permit and alternative mitigation is not available or agreeable, then the City may use the lack of school capacity as a basis for denial of the development permit. 
(3)  Available capacity review is not a concurrency determination and does not relieve the applicant from applying for a concurrency determination. 
(4)  Any person may request an available capacity review at any time for the public facilities identified in this Article. 
(5)  A nonrefundable available capacity review fee will be established by resolution of the City Council. 
(b)  Certificate of concurrency. 
(1)  A valid certificate of concurrency must be issued to a property owner or his designated representative prior to the issuance of the following development orders or approvals, as applicable: 
a.  Zoning permit. 
b.  Building permit. 
c.  Preliminary subdivision plat approval. 
d.  Final subdivision plat approval. 
e.  Development orders for developments of regional impact (DRIs). At the written request of the school district, the concurrency determination for public school facilities may be made at a later point in time pursuant to a separate agreement between the developer and the school district, and which agreement shall be incorporated by reference in the DRI development order. 
f.  Construction drawing approval. 
g.  Development agreements. At the written request of the school district, the concurrency determination for public school facilities may be made at a later point in time pursuant to a separate agreement between the developer and the school district, and which agreement shall be incorporated by reference in the development order. 
(2)  The property owner or his designated representative shall apply for a certificate of concurrency by filing a technically complete sworn application and application fee with the Community Development Department upon a form to be provided by the department. 
(3)  The City Council shall establish an appropriate fee structure by resolution and such fees shall be filed with the application for a certificate of concurrency. 
(4)  If the proposed development is to be developed in different Parts, stages or phases, then the certificate of concurrency shall only apply to that specific part, stage or phase for which a concurrency determination is sought. 
(5)  If the application is deemed concurrent, a certificate of concurrency will be issued by the City. 
(6)  If the application is deemed not to be concurrent, the applicant will be notified in writing by the City. 
(7)  The burden of meeting the concurrency test shall be upon the applicant. The City will direct the applicant to the appropriate staff to assist in the preparation of the necessary documentation and information for inclusion into their application. 
(8)  It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the application for a certificate of concurrency is complete and sufficient and all required information has been provided to the City and, for public school facilities, the Hernando County School Board. 
(9)  Application process. 
a.  Within ten working days of receipt of a complete school concurrency application, the City will transmit said application to the school district for a determination of whether there is adequate school capacity, for each level of school, to accommodate the proposed development, based on the level of service (LOS) standards, concurrency service areas, and other standards set forth in this Article. 
b.  Within 30 days of receipt of the initial transmittal from the City, the school district will review the school concurrency application and, based on the standards set forth in this Article, report in writing to the City: 
i.  Whether adequate school capacity exists for each level of school, based on the standards set forth in this Article and its adopted comprehensive plan; or 
ii.  If adequate capacity does not exist, whether appropriate mitigation can be accepted, and if so, acceptable options for mitigation, consistent with this Article. 
(c)  Concurrency certificate validity. 
(1)  An application for a certificate of concurrency shall be applied for at the time an application is made for any development order or approval referenced in the preceding Section. 
(2)  A certificate of concurrency shall expire simultaneously with the development order or approval it accompanied including any extensions or renewals thereof unless a different expiration period is provided in a valid development agreement between the property owner and the City or in a DRI development order issued by the City pursuant to F.S. § 380.06(15). Furthermore and notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, no person may claim any vested or grandfather rights to concurrency absent either: 
a.  A valid and current written certificate of concurrency; 
b.  A valid and current development agreement between the property owner and the City as approved by the City Council and signed by the mayor; or 
c.  A valid DRI development order issued by the City pursuant to F.S. § 380.06(15). 
(3)  The certificate of concurrency shall apply to the land and is therefore transferable from owner to owner of the subject parcel(s) for the specific project upon which the certificate of concurrency was issued; however, in no event may the certificate of concurrency be transferred off-site or to any other project or parcel(s). 
(4)  Any alteration in scope, density, magnitude, location, project traffic circulation and/or distribution for the subject property must be reported to and approved by the City for certificate re-evaluation. If such alterations are not reported, the certificate of concurrency will be subject to revocation. 
(5)  Public facilities must serve land development in accordance with the adopted level of service standards contained within the City Comprehensive Plan. This certificate of concurrency when issued by the City verifies adequate capacity until its stated expiration date as provided in sub-paragraph (b) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a certificate of concurrency offers no other assurance, does not approve any development order, and does not grant any development rights. 
(d)  Exemption from adequate public facilities review and concurrency review. 
(1)  The purpose of the concurrency review is to determine a project's impact on the provision of public facilities/services. The following will be exempt from the concurrency review for potable water, sewage treatment, drainage, solid waste, parks and recreation facilities and transportation: 
a.  Single-family home or duplex; and 
b.  Non-residential projects consisting of less than 1,500 square feet of floor space, generating less than 20 average daily trips (ADT), and using less than 500 gallons of water per day. 
(2)  The following shall be exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency: 
a.  Single-family lots of record established prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
b.  Duplex lots of record established prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
c.  Amendments to any residential development approval which do not increase the number of residential units or change the type of residential units proposed. 
d.  Any residential development that has a current and valid certificate of concurrency issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
e.  A project or any portion of a project that is age restricted and subject to deed restrictions prohibiting the permanent occupancy of a resident under the age of 55, or is restricted to affordable housing as defined in F.S. § 420.5095, as such statues may be amended or renumbered from time to time. The City shall require a separate development agreement with the applicant and/or evidence of recordable deed restrictions ensuring such commitment to provide senior or age restricted housing, affordable housing, and/or workforce housing. 
f.  Any residential development which has been determined exempt by the Hernando County School District. 
g.  All non-residential uses. 
h.  Residential development that generates less than one student (The applicable student multipliers in effect at the time of submittal shall be utilized). 
Sec. 6-1.3. - Minimum Requirements for Concurrency. 
    A development order will be issued only if the proposed development does not lower the existing level of service of a facility/service below the adopted level of service in the City Comprehensive Plan or provides mitigation in accordance with the terms of the concurrency management requirements. The minimum criteria to satisfy concurrency requirements are as follows: 
(a)  For potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage the following standards must be met, at a minimum, to satisfy the concurrency requirement: 
(1)  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued; or 
(2)  A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur; or 
(3)  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a permit is issued; or 
(4)  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
(b)  For parks and recreation facilities, the criteria under subsection (a) above may be applied or the following minimum standards may be applied: 
(1)  At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services within one year of the issuance of the development permit; or, 
(2)  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires commencement of actual construction of the facilities or the provision of services within one year of the issuance of the applicable development permit. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. ch. 163, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. 
(c)  Transportation. 
(1)  Transportation supply (capacity) shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of the City's comprehensive plan and the terms of this Article. capacity will be based either on FDOT's generalized capacity tables or individual capacity studies utilizing professionally accepted standards and methodologies approved by the City Community Development and Public Works Departments' Directors. 
(2)  Transportation supply is as follows: 
a.  The segment's existing peak hour, peak season, peak direction capacity; or 
b.  The segment's new roadway capacity if facility expansion for the segment is proposed and if: 
i.  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the facility expansion is under construction; or 
ii.  A development order or permit is issued subject to a condition that the facility expansion needed to serve the new development is included in the City's or county's adopted five-year schedule of capital improvements and is scheduled to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of the project's first building permit or its functional equivalent. For purposes of this section, the City may recognize and include transportation projects included in the first three years of the adopted Florida Department of Transportation five-year work program. In order to apply this provision to a facility expansion project, the capital improvements element (CIE) must include the following policies: 
1.  The estimated date of commencement of actual project construction and the estimated date of project completion, and 
2.  A provision that a plan amendment is required to eliminate, defer, or delay construction of any road which is needed to maintain the adopted level of service standard and which is listed in the five-year schedule of capital improvements of the City's or county's adopted comprehensive plans; or 
iii.  At the time a development order or permit is issued, the facility is the subject of a binding executed agreement which requires the facility to be in place or under actual construction no more than three years after the issuance of the project's first building permit or its functional equivalent; the agreement may assign all or a portion of the created capacity; or 
iv.  At the time a development order or permit is issued, the facility is guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement, pursuant to F.S. ch. 163, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of a building permit or its functional equivalent; the agreement may assign all or a portion of the created capacity; or 
v.  The segment is the subject of a proportionate fair-share agreement. In such case, the segment capacity increase reflected in the proportionate fair share agreement shall be available only to the Parties to a proportionate fair share agreement. 
(d)  For public school facilities the following standards must be met, at a minimum, to satisfy the concurrency requirement: 
(1)  All new residential development shall be subject to public school facilities concurrency unless exempted herein. 
(2)  Concurrency service areas (CSAs): 
a.  CSAs will be developed based upon school attendance zones so that there is school capacity in each concurrency service area or contiguous concurrency service area to meet the adopted level of service standard within the five-year time frame contained in the school board's adopted five-year work program (as such work program is updated annually by the school board) and incorporated by reference into the City's capital improvement element. 
b.  CSAs shall be subsequently modified to maximize available school capacity and make efficient use of new and existing public school facilities in accordance with the adopted LOS standards, and taking into account policies which: 
i.  Minimize transportation costs; 
ii.  Limit maximum student travel times; 
iii.  Affect desegregation plans; 
iv.  Achieve socio-economic, racial and cultural diversity objectives; 
v.  Recognize capacity commitments resulting from the development approvals by the City for the CSA; and 
vi.  Recognize capacity commitments resulting from development approvals by the City for contiguous CSAs. 
c.  All CSAs will be described geographically and appropriately mapped. 
(e)  Calculation of capacity. The school district will determine whether adequate school capacity exists for a proposed residential development based on the adopted LOS as follows: 
(1)  Calculate total public school facilities by adding the capacity provided by existing public school facilities, except magnet/lottery schools, to the capacity of any planned school facilities. 
(2)  Calculate available public school capacity by subtracting from the total public school facilities the sum of: 
a.  Used capacity; 
b.  The portion of reserved capacity projected to be developed within three years; 
c.  The portion of previously approved development projected to be developed within three years; and 
d.  The demand on public schools created by the proposed development. 
(f)  Determination of sufficient school capacity for residential development: 
(1)  In determining whether there is sufficient school capacity to accommodate a proposed residential development, the school district will consider: 
a.  Subject CSA. Available capacity will be determined based upon permanent FISH capacity of existing and planned facilities at each public school type (i.e. elementary, middle and high); and, 
b.  Contiguous CSA. If the projected student growth from a residential development causes the adopted LOS to be exceeded in the subject CSA, then each contiguous CSA will be reviewed for available capacity pursuant to this Article and shall take into account: 
i.  Travel time and distance (school bus route from the school to the site of the proposed development should not exceed 50 minutes); 
ii.  Where school capacity is reserved for a specific academic or magnet program(s) at a particular school or for establishing student diversity, then such capacity cannot be claimed in a contiguous concurrency service area for purposes of determining available capacity; and, 
iii.  Where two CSAs are separated or divided by the Withlacoochee State Forest, then they shall not be deemed contiguous for purposes of determining available capacity. 
c.  In conducting the contiguity review, the school district shall first use the contiguous CSA with the most available capacity to evaluate projected enrollment and, if necessary, shall continue to the CSA with the next most available capacity until all contiguous CSAs have been evaluated or the available capacity has been identified to allow a determination letter approving school concurrency to be issued. If a contiguous CSA is identified having available capacity, then the actual development impacts shall be shifted to that CSA having available capacity (this shift shall be accomplished in accordance with school board policy and which may include, without limitation, appropriate boundary changes or shifting future student assignments). 
(g)  Issuance of residential development orders predicated on sufficient public school facility capacity: 
(1)  The issuance of development orders for new residential units shall be predicated on the availability of public school capacity. 
(2)  Whether there is adequate public school capacity to accommodate students generated by the proposed development for each type of public school within the affected CSA consistent with the adopted LOS standard will take into consideration that: 
a.  Adequate public school facilities will be in place or under actual construction within three years after the issuance of the subdivision approval or site plan (or functional equivalent); or, 
b.  Adequate public school facilities are available in an adjacent CSA and the impacts of development can be shifted to that area; or, 
c.  The developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the actual development of the property subject to the subdivision approval or site plan (or functional equivalent) pursuant to this Article. 
(3)  If the impact of the proposed development will not occur until years two or three of the school board's work plan, then any relevant programmed improvements in those years shall be considered available capacity for the project and factored into the level of service analysis. If the impact of the project will not occur until years four or five of the work plan, then any relevant programmed improvements shall not be considered available capacity for the project unless funding of the improvements is assured through school board funding to accelerate the project, through proportionate share mitigation, or some other means. 
(4)  If the school district determines that adequate capacity does not exist but that the developer's proffered proportionate share mitigation agreement is an acceptable alternative, the development application will remain active pending the conclusion of the mitigation negotiation period. 
(5)  The City will issue a certificate of concurrency for public schools only upon: 
a.  The school district's written determination that adequate school capacity will be in place or under actual construction within three years after the issuance of subdivision approval or site plan approval (or functional equivalent) for each level of school without mitigation; or, 
b.  The execution of a legally binding mitigation agreement between the applicant, the school board and the City. 
(h)  In determining the availability of services or facilities, a developer may propose and the City may approve developments in stages or phases so that the facilities and services needed for each phase will be available concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. 
Sec. 6-1.4. - Facility/Service Demand Calculations. 
(a)  The following calculations shall be used to determine the projected demand of the proposed project described in an application for a development permit on the public facilities and services. The information necessary to enable the City to perform the facility/service demand calculations in the following shall be provided by the applicant to the City. 
(1)  Potable water: Adopted LOS = 250 gal./day/equivalent residential unit (ERU) 250 gal ×  ____________ ERU's = demand 
(2)  Sewage treatment: Adopted LOS = 200 gal./day/ERU. 200 gal ×  ____________ ERU's = demand 
(3)  Drainage: Adopted LOS is equivalent to and no less than the regulations of the Southwest Florida Water Management District for closed basins, as provided for in the Florida Administrative Codes 40D-4 and 40D-40. 
(4)  Solid waste: Adopted LOS = 6.2 lbs./day/person (non-residential uses are included in the City's comprehensive plan adopted LOS). Solid waste will be calculated on a City-wide basis at regular intervals. Current estimate is 6.2 lbs. per capita. Population × 6.2 lbs. per day = Demand. 
(5)  Parks and recreation facilities: 
Recreation and Open Space Minimum Standards Picnic table 20 per 6,000 persons Swimming pool 1 per 10,000 persons Baseball field (regulation) 1 per 6,000 persons Tennis court 1 per 2,000 persons Basketball court 1 per 5,000 persons Volleyball court 1 per 5,000 persons Recreational building 1 per 15,000 persons Outdoor theater 1 per 20,000 persons Shooting range 1 per 50,000 persons Golf course 1 per 25,000 persons Equipped play area 1 per 3,000 persons Multi-use court 1 per 10,000 persons Shuffleboard 1 per 6,000 persons Handball court 1 per 10,000 persons Horseshoe court 1 per 5,000 persons Multi sport play field 1 per 5,000 persons  
(6)  Transportation: 
a.  Level of service standards. The LOS requirement shall be as provided for in the City Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  Traffic study requirements. The purpose of the traffic study or assessment is to identify the potential impacts of new development on the City and county roadway network. Such a study or assessment shall provide information for making a concurrency determination on each impacted segment of the road network. The study or assessment shall identify traffic volumes on each impacted roadway, identify where the adopted level of service is exceeded, and recommend potential solutions or improvements. The study or assessment will include segment and intersection analysis where appropriate or otherwise required. 
i.  Land Development Traffic Assessment ("LDTA") shall refer to a traffic study which has been prepared in accordance with the standards and methodology set forth in "Hernando County Traffic Study Procedures," by Tindale-Oliver & Associates (January 2008), as may be updated from time to time. The LDTA may be classified as "Minor" or "Major." 
ii.  Determine the number of average daily trips generated by the proposed project using the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manual (most current edition). No traffic study will be required for developments generating less than 100 average daily trips according to the ITE Trip Generation manual (most current edition). Trips will be assigned by the county to determine if adequate capacity is available on the road network in the impacted area. If the adopted level of service on the impacted roadway is exceeded, the applicant, at its expense, will be required to submit a Minor LDTA in accordance with the adopted study criteria. 
iii.  If the project is calculated to generate more than 100, but less than 1,000 average daily trips according to the ITE Trip Generation manual (most current edition), a Minor LDTA shall be submitted by the applicant. 
iv.  If the project is calculated to generate more than 1,000, average daily trips, according to the ITE Trip Generation manual, current edition, a Major LDTA shall be submitted by the applicant. 
v.  Comprehensive plan amendment. For applications that involve large scale plan amendments (i.e. ten acres or more of land), and for small scale plan amendments that generate over 1,000 average daily trips according to the ITE Trip Generation manual (most current edition), a comprehensive plan amendment traffic study meeting LDTA standards and requirements shall be submitted by the applicant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the plan amendment encompasses ten acres or more of land but generates less than 1,000 average daily trips, then the applicant may perform a five-year concurrency analysis in lieu of the foregoing if approved in advance by the City. 
vi.  Development of regional impact. For all applications which involve a development of regional impact (DRI), the applicant's traffic study shall include data and analysis relative to the Application for Development Approval (for the DRI) prepared in accordance with F.S. ch. 380.06, as may be amended or renumbered from time to time. 
vii.  Signed and sealed by engineer. All traffic studies and assessments required under this section shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a professional engineer registered and practicing in the State of Florida, qualified to perform traffic studies and assessments, and in accordance with professionally recognized industry standards. 
viii.  If a land development traffic assessment (LDTA), a comprehensive plan amendment traffic study, or a development of regional impact traffic study pursuant to this section is required, it shall be prepared and submitted by the applicant at the applicant's expense. 
(7)  Public schools: 
a.  Level of service (LOS) standards contained herein shall be used to determine whether sufficient public school capacity exists to accommodate future development projects, and evaluate the sufficiency of the five-year schedule of capital improvements. The five-year schedule of capital improvements shall be reviewed, updated, and adopted annually thus ensuring those projects necessary to address existing deficiencies, and to meet future needs based upon the adopted level of service standards. The annual update to the five-year schedule of capital improvements shall ensure the level of service standards will continue to be achieved and maintained. 
b.  The level of service standards shall be applied consistently on a district-wide basis to all schools of the same type (i.e. elementary schools, middle schools, high schools). 
c.  The LOS standards to for schools shall be calculated as a percentage of FISH capacity as follows: 
i.  Elementary: 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Permanent Student Stations, and 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Core Facilities (whichever is the greater number will be used for calculating student capacities for LOS). 
ii.  Middle School: 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Permanent Student Stations, and 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Core Facilities (whichever is the greater number will be used for calculating student capacities for LOS). 
iii.  High School: 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Permanent Student Stations, and 100 percent of Permanent FISH capacity for Core Facilities (whichever is the greater number will be used for calculating student capacities for LOS). 
iv.  Magnet schools will maintain the level of service standard for the type of school for which it is constructed whether an elementary, middle, or high. 
v.  For purposes of this subsection, "Core Facilities" shall mean "Permanent Cafeteria capacity" based on FISH standards. 
(b)  Alternative demand calculations. If the applicant claims the standards provided in the demand calculations are not applicable to the proposed project, the applicant shall submit appropriate documentation based on professionally accepted methodology and practices supporting the proposed alternative demand calculation to the City. Any alternative calculation standard shall be subject to approval of the City and, if related to the determination of demands on public school facilities, the Hernando County School Board. 
(c)  Appellate procedures. Any appeal of a denial of a certificate of concurrency for potable water, sewage treatment, drainage, solid waste, parks and recreation facilities and transportation shall be to the City Council within 30 days of receipt of written notification of denial. The notification of denial shall be provided via certified mail. Pursuant to Hernando County School District Policy 8.54., any appeal of a finding of no available school capacity by the school district for public schools shall be to the school district within 30 days of the issuance of the determination. 
PART 6-2 - PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE MITIGATION 

Sec. 6-2.1. - Transportation Facilities Proportionate Fair-Share Mitigation. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180. 
(b)  Findings. The City Council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the City proportionate fair-share program: 
(1)  Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
(2)  Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair share of the cost of expanding or improving a transportation facility; 
(3)  Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; and 
(4)  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the City to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element. 
(c)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to any development project in the City where the project's traffic impact study or the City's community development or public works directors determine that there is insufficient capacity on one or more segments to satisfy the development project's transportation concurrency requirements. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in this Article. 
(d)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant whose project meets the criteria of this section may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations, and 
b.  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City or county capital improvements element (CIE) includes one or more transportation improvements that, upon completion, will provide sufficient capacity for the deficient segments to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  The City may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment, through the proportionate fair-share program, by the developer contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will create additional capacity on the deficient segment sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicant's proposed development even if the improvement project for the deficient segment is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE where: 
a.  The City Council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate share agreement and corresponding future changes to the five-year CIE, and 
b.  The City adopts, by ordinance or resolution, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year CIE. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed schedule of capital improvements in the CIE must be reviewed by the City Council. 
(3)  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system, the City may enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair share is calculated if the proportionate fair share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the government entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
(4)  Improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule at the next annual capital improvements update. 
(5)  Any improvement project proposed to meet a developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the City or county for locally maintained roadways in their jurisdiction and those of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for the state highway system. 
(e)  Application process. 
(1)  Upon identification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall attend a pre-application meeting with appropriate staff to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), then the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will be notified and invited to Participate in the preapplication meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the City that includes nonrefundable application fee as established by resolution, and the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of property; 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity, and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); 
g.  Copy of concurrency application; 
h.  Copy of the project's traffic impact statement (TIS) or traffic impact analysis (TIA); and 
i.  Location map depicting the site and affected road network. 
(4)  Within ten business days, the Chief Administrative Officer shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in this section, then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The City Council may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. ch. 163.3180, proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires consultation with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). If an SIS facility is proposed for proportionate share mitigation, the applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the City or the applicant with direction from the City and delivered to the appropriate Parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a strategic intermodal system (SIS) facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which the application was determined to be sufficient and no fewer than 14 days prior to the City Council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The City shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the City Council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the City Council. 
(f)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. ch. 163 as follows: 
The cumulative number of peak hour, peak direction trips from the complete build out of the proposed development, or build out of the stage or phase being approved, that are assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided by the change in the peak hour directional maximum service volume (MSV) of the proportionate share program segment resulting from construction of the proportionate share program improvement, multiplied by the anticipated construction cost of the proportionate share project in the year that construction will occur. 
This methodology is expressed by the following formula: 
Proportionate fair share = S[[(Development Trips i ) ÷ (SV Increase i )] × Cost i ] 
(Note: In the context of the formula, the term "cumulative" does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development.) 
Where: 
S= Sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fair-share mitigation for a project. 
Development Trips i = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system. 
SV Increase i = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i". 
Cost i = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs, including design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs, directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur. 
In using the proportionate-share formula provided herein, the applicant, in its traffic analysis, shall identify those roads or facilities that have a transportation deficiency in accordance with the transportation deficiency as defined below. The proportionate-share formula provided in this subsection shall be applied only to those facilities that are determined to be significantly impacted by the project traffic under review. If any road is determined to be transportation deficient without the project traffic under review, the costs of correcting that deficiency shall be removed from the project's proportionate-share calculation and the necessary transportation improvements to correct that deficiency shall be considered to be in place for purposes of the proportionate-share calculation. The improvement necessary to correct the transportation deficiency is the funding responsibility of the entity that has maintenance responsibility for the facility. The development's proportionate share shall be calculated only for the needed transportation improvements that are greater than the identified deficiency. 
When the provisions of this subsection have been satisfied for a particular stage or phase of development, all transportation impacts from that stage or phase for which mitigation was required and provided shall be deemed fully mitigated in any transportation analysis for a subsequent stage or phase of development. Trips from a previous stage or phase that did not result in impacts for which mitigation was required or provided may be cumulatively analyzed with trips from a subsequent stage or phase to determine whether an impact requires mitigation for the subsequent stage or phase. In projecting the number of trips to be generated by the development under review, any trips assigned to a toll-financed facility shall be eliminated from the analysis. 
As used in this subsection, the term "transportation deficiency" means a facility or facilities on which the adopted level-of-service standard is exceeded by the existing, committed, and vested trips, plus additional projected background trips from any source other than the development project under review, and trips that are forecast by established traffic standards, including traffic modeling, consistent with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research medium population projections. Additional projected background trips are to be coincident with the particular stage or phase of development under review. 
(4)  For purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the City shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. These costs will be determined by the City's Public Works Department. Accepted sources for determining improvement costs may include, but not be limited to, the most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted, based upon the type of cross-section, and locally available data from recent projects. 
(5)  If the City has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the City's public works director or other method approved by the City's public works director. 
(6)  If the City has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the City and will be at no expense to the City. Said appraisal shall assume no approved development plan for the site. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the City at no expense to the City. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant (based on a City-approved appraisal) is less than the City estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant (based on a City-approved appraisal) is more than the City estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for the development, then the City will give the applicant roads impact fee credit for the difference. 
(g)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation payments for a development project shall be applied as a credit toward the roads impact fees assessed to that development project to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the applicable impact fee ordinance. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for a proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the roads impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated roads impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant must pay the remaining impact fee amount. 
(3)  A proportionate fair-share contribution is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any roads impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development may not be transferred to any other location. 
(4)  The amount of roads impact fee (RIF) credit for a proportionate fair-share contribution may be up to but shall not exceed the project's proportionate fair share amount. 
(5)  A proportionate fair share impact fee credit shall be applied consistent with the following formula: 
Applicant payment = [(Total project roads impact fees assessed) + (Proportionate Share Payment)] - (RIF CREDIT) 
(h)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon executing a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) and satisfying other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive a City certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for building permits within the time frame provided for in the City concurrency certificate, then the project's concurrency vesting shall expire, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. Once a proportionate share payment for a project is made and other impact fees for the project are paid, no refunds shall be given. All payments, however, shall run with the land. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution for a project and payment of other impact fees assessed to that project shall be due and must be paid prior to the effective date of the proportionate fair share agreement. The effective date shall be specified in the agreement and shall be the date the agreement is approved by the City Council. 
(3)  All developer improvements accepted as proportionate fair share contributions must be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share agreement and be accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. The security instrument shall conform to the subdivision construction security requirements utilized by the City Community Development Department. It is the intent of this Article that any required improvements be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share agreement. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must occur prior to the effective date of the proportionate fair share agreement. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may withdraw from a proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the City are nonrefundable. 
(7)  The City may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(i)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the City capital improvements element, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the capital improvements element (CIE), then the proportionate fair share revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that same corridor or sector where the alternative improvement will mitigate the impacts of the development project on the congested roadway(s) for which the original proportionate fair share contribution was made. 
Sec. 6-2.2. - Public School Facilities Proportionate Fair-Share Mitigation. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of proposed residential development on public school facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180. It is acknowledged that State Statutes and standards may change and, given such, that the school district may identify alternatives to the mitigation methods provided in this section. The City shall therefore recognize a certificate of concurrency issued by the school district that utilizes mitigation methods not identified in this section. 
(b)  Findings. The Brooksville City Council finds and determines that public school facilities capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the City proportionate fair-share program: 
(1)  Provides a method by which the impacts of development on public school facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
(2)  Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of public school facilities concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair share of the cost of expanding or improving a public school facility; 
(3)  Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of overcrowding at public school facilities; and 
(4)  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate public school facilities to serve future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the school board to expedite public school facilities improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for public school facilities improvements in the capital improvements element. 
(c)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to any residential development project in the City of Brooksville where the project's impact indicates that there is insufficient capacity to satisfy the development project's public school facilities concurrency requirements. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in this Article. 
(d)  General requirements. An applicant whose project meets the criteria of this section may choose to satisfy public schools facilities concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations, and 
(2)  The school district determines that adequate capacity does not exist but that mitigation is an acceptable alternative, and the developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation acceptable to the school district proportionate to the demand for public school facilities created by the actual development project. 
(e)  Mitigation alternatives. 
(1)  In the event the proposed project meets the requirements for proportionate fair share contribution, the following procedure shall be used. 
a.  The applicant shall initiate in writing a mitigation negotiation period with the school board in order to establish an acceptable form of mitigation. 
b.  Acceptable forms of mitigation may include: 
i.  The donation, construction, or funding of school facilities sufficient to offset the demand for public school facilities to be created by the proposed development. 
ii.  Construction of a charter school that complies with the requirements of F.S. § 1002.33(18). 
iii.  The creation of mitigation banking based on the developer's construction and/or financing of a public school facility in exchange for the right to sell excess capacity credits (the selling of excess credits shall be limited to that area within the subject CSA or any abutting CSA) and as may be further limited by this Article. 
(2)  The following standards apply to any proportionate share mitigation agreement: 
a.  Relocatable classrooms will not be accepted as mitigation. 
b.  Mitigation shall be directed to projects on the school board's five-year work plan that the school district agrees will satisfy the demand created by that development approval, and shall be assured by a legally binding development agreement between the school board, the City and the applicant. The development agreement shall be executed prior to the issuance of the applicable subdivision plat, site plan or functional equivalent in the development review process. 
c.  The student generation formula used for calculating mitigation shall be as follows: 
Number of Student Stations (by school type) = Number of Dwelling units (by housing type) × Student Generation Multiplier (by housing type and school type)* 
* Student Generation Multipliers shall be based upon the best available data and professionally accepted methodology as presented in the supporting data and analysis of the comprehensive plan public school facilities element. 
d.  For purposes of this Article, cost per student station estimates shall include, at a minimum, all costs of providing instructional and core capacity including land, site improvements, design, buildings, equipment, furniture, and costs of financing (if applicable). The capital costs associated with transportation of students shall not be included in the cost per student station estimate used for mitigation. 
e.  The proportionate mitigation share amount shall be calculated as follows: 
Proportionate Share Amount = Number of Student Stations (by school type) × Cost per Student Station (by school type)** 
** The above formula shall be calculated for each housing type within the proposed development and for each school type (elementary, middle, high) for which a capacity deficiency has been identified. The sum of these calculations shall be the proportionate share amount for the development under review. 
f.  If the school district agrees to the mitigation, the school district must commit to adding the improvement required for mitigation to its work plan and the City shall amend its capital improvements element/capital improvements schedule to adopt the school board's revised work program. 
(3)  The applicant's total proportionate-share mitigation obligation to resolve a capacity deficiency shall be based on the following formula, for each public school type (elementary, middle, high, magnet): 
a.  Multiply the number of new student stations required to serve the new development by the cost per student station (as estimated pursuant to subsection (2) above). 
b.  The applicant's proportionate-share mitigation obligation will be credited toward any other impact fee or exaction imposed by local ordinance for the same need. 
(4)  Mitigation negotiation period. 
a.  If within 90 days of the date the applicant initiates the mitigation negotiation period, the applicant and the school district are able to agree to an acceptable form of mitigation, a legally binding mitigation agreement shall be executed by the applicant and the school district (together with the City) which sets forth the terms of the mitigation, including such issues as the amount, nature, and timing of donations, construction, or funding to be provided by the developer, and any other matters necessary to effectuate mitigation in accordance with the City's comprehensive plan and this Article. The mitigation agreement shall specify the amount and timing of any impact fee credits or reimbursements, if any, that the developer expects to receive in connection with its mitigation payment/donation under said agreement. 
b.  If, after 90 days, the applicant and the school district are unable to agree to an acceptable form of mitigation, the school district will report an impasse to the City, in writing and the City will not issue a finding of adequate school capacity and associated certificate of school concurrency for the proposed development. 
c.  The school district may grant up to two 90-day extensions to the mitigation negotiation period. 
(5)  To the extent required under Florida law, mitigation must be proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the actual development of the property.

Defense of such civil action shall include, but not be limited to, any civil rights lawsuits seeking relief against such officers, employees or agents for acts or omissions under color of State Law, custom or usage, wherein it is alleged that such officer, employee or agent has deprived another person of his rights secured under Federal Constitution or Laws. The City Council of the City of Brooksville shall pay, within the limitations provided by law and available funds, any final judgment, including damages, costs and attorney's fees, against any officer, employee or agent of the Planning and Zoning Commission held to be liable in a civil or civil rights lawsuit or any compromise or settlement thereof prior to judgment, provided that such judgment is not based upon any such officer, employee or agent acting in bad faith, with malicious purpose, or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety and/or property. This provision is not, however, intended to waive sovereign immunity, any limitation or liability or any other defense or immunity to such lawsuits. 
(Ord. No. 831, § 2, 8-6-2012) 
Sec. 8-1.5. - Enforcement. 
    It is the purpose of this Section to establish a code enforcement system which will promote the health, safety and welfare of the City's residents. Further, it is intended that such system will support the goals, policies and objectives of the City's comprehensive plan and enforce the land development regulations created to implement the plan. 
(a)  Violations and applicability. 
(1)  Any person owning and/or occupying any building or structure that is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered or moved or maintained or any building, structure, land or water used in violation of this Code shall be subject to the penalties as provided for in this Code. The City may institute any appropriate action or proceedings in a City code enforcement action or civil action in the circuit court to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, movement, maintenance, or use; or, to restrain, correct or abate such violation; or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, land or water, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct of business or use in or about such premises. 
(2)  Pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, Part II, the City of Brooksville may establish a code enforcement system to take corrective action against violators of the provisions of the land development regulations and/or any other willful violations of City codes and ordinances and to assess fines when applicable. 
(3)  This regulation does hereby incorporate and shall be used for the enforcement of all ordinances and codes duly adopted by the City of Brooksville and hereinafter adopted by the City of Brooksville as well as all state statutes presently existing together with all amendments, revisions, changes and/or additions thereto. 
(b)  Code enforcement officers and violations. The City of Brooksville through its Chief Administrative Officer may designate certain of its employees as code enforcement officers. Such employees may include but are not limited to code enforcement officers, law enforcement officers or fire safety inspectors. The designation of an employee as a code enforcement officer shall not provide the code enforcement officer with the power of arrest. 
(1)  A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance. 
(2)  Prior to issuing a citation, a code enforcement officer shall provide due notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of a code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no more than 30 days. If upon personal investigation, the code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the specified time period, the code enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. A code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(3)  A code enforcement officer shall issue a citation in such form as may be approved by the Chief Administrative Officer and it shall contain: 
a.  The date and time of issuance. 
b.  The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued. 
c.  The date and time the civil infraction was committed. 
d.  The facts constituting probable cause. 
e.  If the violation was committed on private property owned by the violator, the tax parcel number or the property appraiser's alternate key number for the private property on which the violation occurred. 
f.  The number and Section of the code or ordinance violated. 
g.  The name and title of the code enforcement officer. 
h.  The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to appeal the citation. 
i.  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to pay the penalty within the 30-day period allowed. 
j.  The possible maximum civil penalty if the person elects to appeal the citation. 
k.  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty and fails to appeal the citation within 30 days after issuance, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the citation, and that, in such case, the penalty shall automatically increase to the maximum civil penalty for such violation. 
(4)  Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. § 775.082 or F.S. § 775.083. 
(5)  Any person who fails to pay the civil penalty stated on the citation within the prescribed 30-day period, and who fails to appeal the citation within the prescribed 30-day period, shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the citation. In such case, the penalty shall automatically increase to the maximum civil penalty for such violation. 
(6)  The civil penalty assessed by a hearing officer after hearing an appeal, along with any enforcement costs assessed against the violator, shall bear interest at the legal rate. The maximum civil penalty assessed upon the failure of the violator to either pay the civil penalty stated on the citation or appeal the citation shall bear interest at the legal rate. 
(c)  Infraction penalties. Unless a different penalty is specifically set out elsewhere in the City of Brooksville Code of Ordinances for a particular civil infraction, penalties for civil infractions cited hereunder shall be assessed as follows: 
(1)  For the first violation, $50.00. 
(2)  For a second violation of the same code or ordinance Section within a five-year period, $125.00. 
(3)  For a third and each subsequent violation of the same code or ordinance Section within a five-year period, $200.00. 
(4)  For a second violation of any type by the same violator on the same property owned by the violator within a five-year period, $125.00. 
(5)  For a third and each subsequent violation of any type by the same violator on the same property owned by the violator within a five-year period, $200.00. 
(6)  The maximum civil penalty for any violation shall be $500.00. 
(7)  Attorney's fees and administration costs for appealed citations shall be set by the hearing officer and assessed by the hearing officer against any person found to have committed a civil infraction. 
(d)  Uncontested violations. Any person not wishing to appeal the citation may pay the amount set forth in the citation as the uncontested penalty, by the date set forth in the citation. 
(e)  Citation appeal. 
(1)  Within 30 days after issuance of a citation, the person to whom the citation was issued may appeal the citation by filing a notice of appeal with the Chief Administrative Officer on such form as may be approved by the Chief Administrative Officer, and by paying a filing fee of $250.00. If the appeal is successful and the violation is dismissed, the filing fee shall be returned to the person who filed the appeal. If the appeal is not successful, the filing fee shall be retained by the City to cover the costs of the hearing officer. The appeal form shall include, at a minimum, the name, mailing address and telephone number of the person filing the appeal, and a copy of the citation appealed shall be attached to the form. 
(2)  Within 60 days after the filing of a notice of appeal, the Chief Administrative Officer shall arrange for a hearing officer, who shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in Florida, and shall schedule the hearing at a time agreeable to the person filing the appeal and to the code enforcement officer, but in no event later than 90 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. 
(3)  Within 15 days after the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision either dismissing the citation or affirming the citation, assessing a fine, and assessing attorney's fees and administration costs of the City. The decision shall be mailed to the Chief Administrative Officer and to the person filing the appeal at the address listed on the appeal form. 
(f)  Unpaid civil penalties. The City may record on the public records of the county a lien for any civil penalty, together with assessed attorney's fees and administration costs, if applicable, and accrued interest, whenever such civil penalty has remained unpaid for a period of six months. When so filed, the lien shall attach to all real and personal property of the violator located in the county. 
(g)  Code enforcement hearing officer. Pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, the City Council shall appoint at least one code enforcement hearing officer, and may appoint others as necessary. A hearing officer shall be an attorney, licensed to practice law within the state, whose practice is substantially in the area of administrative, governmental, zoning, land use, or real estate law. A hearing officer shall not hear any matter in which the hearing officer has a conflict of interest. If such a conflict exists, the hearing officer shall request that the City Council designate another hearing officer, who may be appointed on a temporary basis to hear the case. A hearing officer shall serve at the pleasure of the City Council and may be removed from service at any time, without cause, by a majority vote of the City Council. A hearing officer shall not be a City employee, but shall enter into an agreement to provide professional services at a rate established by the City Council. A hearing officer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such travel, mileage, and per diem expenses as may be authorized in the agreement with the City. 
(1)  Prosecution of cases. 
a.  The City Attorney shall represent the City and the code enforcement officers before the hearing officer. 
b.  The City Attorney shall present the City's case on all formal hearings and shall have prosecutorial discretion including, but not limited to, the right to negotiate a settlement with a violator and present that settlement to the hearing officer for approval, and to recommend the disposition of a case to the hearing officer. 
c.  If an appeal is taken from a decision of a hearing officer, the City Attorney shall represent the City in such proceedings. 
2.  Jurisdiction. 
a.  The hearing officer shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide alleged violations of all codes and ordinances in force in the City. 
b.  The jurisdiction of the hearing officer shall not be exclusive. Any alleged violation of any of the aforesaid codes and ordinances may be pursued by appropriate remedy in court at the option of the administering official whose responsibility it is to enforce that respective code or ordinance. Nothing contained in this Code shall prohibit the City from enforcing its codes and ordinances by any other means. 
(3)  Powers of hearing officer. The hearing officer shall have power to: 
a.  Adopt rules for the conduct of hearings. 
b.  Subpoena alleged violators, witnesses, and evidence to hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the county sheriff or other sheriffs of the state. 
c.  Take testimony under oath. 
d.  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(4)  Notices. 
a.  Notice of each hearing of the hearing officer shall be given in compliance with the requirements of due process and the Florida Open Meetings Law. 
b.  In addition, all notices to alleged violators required by this division shall be by one of the following methods: 
i.  Certified mail, return receipt requested; 
ii.  Hand delivery by the sheriff, or other law enforcement officer, the code enforcement officer, or other person designated by the City Council;

c.  In lieu of providing notice as set forth in subsection b. of this Section, at the option of the hearing officer, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
i.  Notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50, for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
ii.  In lieu of publication as described in subsubsection c.i. of this Section, notice may be posted for at least ten days in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property on which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at City Hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
iii.  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required pursuant to subsection b. of this Section. 
iv.  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand-deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (b) of this Section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (c) of this Section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this Section have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(5)  Enforcement procedure. 
a.  It shall be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances. The hearing officer shall not have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
b.  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section, if a violation of the codes or ordinances is found, the code enforcement officer shall first notify the violator and give such person a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code enforcement officer shall notify the hearing officer and request a hearing. The hearing officer shall schedule a hearing and, through the clerical staff of the City, provide notice of the hearing as required herein. If the violation is corrected and then recurs, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer, the case may be presented to the hearing officer even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
c.  If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the hearing officer and request a hearing. The hearing officer shall schedule a hearing and, through clerical staff of the City, provide notice as required herein. The case may be presented to the hearing officer even if a repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. 
d.  If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or a condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the hearing officer and request a hearing. 
(6)  Conduct of hearing. 
a.  Upon request of a code enforcement officer, or at such other time as may be necessary, the hearing officer shall set hearings. 
b.  Every effort shall be made to set hearings within 30 days of the hearing officer receiving a request for hearing from the code enforcement officer. In general, the hearing officer shall endeavor to set hearings, and move matters to conclusion, as expeditiously as possible, allowing for notice as required herein. 
c.  Upon scheduling a hearing, the hearing officer shall cause notice thereof to be furnished to the alleged violator as provided herein. Such notice of hearing shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing, and shall state the nature of the violation and reference to the appropriate code or ordinance. 
d.  At the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the code enforcement officer to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a violation exists or occurred. 
e.  All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The hearing officer shall take testimony from the code enforcement officer and alleged violator and from such other witnesses as may be called by the respective sides. 
f.  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern such proceedings. All relevant evidence shall be admitted if, in the opinion of the hearing officer, it is the type of evidence upon which reasonable and responsible persons would normally rely in the conduct of business affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make the evidence inadmissible over objections in civil actions. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but such hearsay evidence shall not in and of itself be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision unless the evidence would be admissible over objections in a civil action. 
g.  The hearing officer may inquire of any witness before the hearing officer. The alleged violator, or his attorney, and the attorney representing the City shall be permitted to inquire of any witness before the hearing officer and shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements. 
h.  The hearing officer may, for good cause shown, postpone or continue a formal hearing. 
i.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein and by F.S. ch. 162. The order shall be stated orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed to the alleged violator within ten days after the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date, and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date. 
j.  A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute a notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns, if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the hearing officer shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(7)  Penalties. 
a.  The hearing officer may, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of the hearing officer has not been complied with by the set time, or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this Section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the hearing officer for compliance, or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code enforcement officer. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided for in this division, a hearing shall be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine, but notice of such hearing shall be sufficient if given by regular mail to the violator's last known mailing address. 
b.  A fine imposed pursuant to this Section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. If the hearing officer finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, the hearing officer may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the hearing officer shall consider the following factors: 
i.  The gravity of the violation; 
ii.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
iii.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
c.  If a repeat violation is corrected prior to a hearing, the hearing officer may conduct a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement costs upon the repeat violator. 
d.  The hearing officer shall award the City all costs incurred in prosecuting a case before the hearing officer if the City prevails and requests that it recover its costs incurred. Such costs may include the fees paid by the City to its City Attorney and to the hearing officer and the hourly pay and corresponding benefits paid to the code enforcement officer for time spent on the violation. 
e.  The hearing officer may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this Section and may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this Section. 
f.  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of the county, and shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriff's office of the state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. 
g.  A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this Section, whichever occurs first. If, after three months from the filing of any such lien, the lien remains unpaid, the hearing officer may authorize the City Attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this division may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X, of the Florida Constitution. 
h.  Pursuant to F.S. ch. 55, no lien provided for in this division shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded unless, within that time, an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, incurred in the foreclosure. The City shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in a recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration with notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(8)  Appeals. 
a.  An aggrieved party, including the City Council, may appeal a final administrative order of the hearing officer to the circuit court. Any such appeal shall be filed as a petition for writ of certiorari within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
b.  Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the hearing officer. 
c.  The appealing party shall pay the costs for preparation of the record to be appealed, based on the City's usual charges for copies of public records.

b.  That such special conditions and circumstances did not result from the action or negligence of the applicant, 
c.  That granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges denied by this Code to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district, 
d.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of the Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in this same zoning district under the terms of this Code and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant, 
e.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure, and 
f.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Code and that such variance will not interfere with the rights of or be injurious to others or otherwise detrimental to the public interest or welfare.

(4)  Issuing permits. 
a.  Action on permits. 
1.  The Building Official shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the Building Official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the technical codes referred to in Section 10-1.2(e) and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he shall issue a permit to the applicant. When authorized through contractual agreement with a school board, in acting on applications for permits, the Building Official shall give first priority to any applications for the construction of, or addition or renovation to, any school or educational facility. 
2.  If a state university, state community college, or public school district elects to use the City's code enforcement offices, fees charged for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures and facilities of state universities, state colleges, and public school districts shall not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the Code. 
3.  No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the City any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under F.S. ch. 471: 
a.  Electrical documents for any new building or addition which requires an aggregate service capacity of 600 amperes (240 volts) or more on a residential electrical system or 800 amperes (240 volts) on a commercial or industrial electrical system and which costs more than $50,000.00. 
b.  Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $50,000.00. 
c.  Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. A contractor I, contractor II, or contractor IV, certified under F.S. § 633.521, may design a fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of not more than 49 heads, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system. 
d.  Heating, ventilation and air conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $50,000.00. This subsection does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering a structural part of the building or for work on a residential one-family, two-family, three-family or four-family structure. An air conditioning system may be designed by an installing air conditioning contractor certified under F.S. ch. 489, to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air conditioning system with a value of $50,000.00 or less; and when a 15-ton-per-system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above required design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. 
1.  Example 1. When a space has two ten-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each system is less than 15 tons. 
2.  Example 2. Consider a small single story office building which consists of six individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air conditioning work is $47,000.00 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. 
    Note: The limiting criteria of 100 persons and $50,000.00 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost of the total air conditioning system of the building.

4.  The Building Official may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county, and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies or federal agencies." 
5.  A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 working days of application therefor unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code or City's Code. 
b.  Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the technical codes referred to in Section 10-1.2(e) or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the Building Official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
c.  Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in F.S. ch. 440, workers compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in F.S. §§ 440.10 and 440.38. 
d.  Asbestos removal. Moving, removal or disposal of asbestos-containing materials may be permitted on a residential building where the owner occupies the building, the building is not for sale or lease, and the work is performed according to the owner-builder limitations provided in the disclosure statement. To qualify for exemption under this subsection, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application. The Building Official shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
Disclosure Statement 
State law requires asbestos abatement to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within one year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. 
e.  Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the Building Official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at their own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the technical codes referred to in Section 10-1.2(e). 
f.  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the Building Official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where such building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application for right-of-way permits from the authority having jurisdiction over the street, alley or public lane. 
(5)  Conditions of the permit. 
a.  Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes referred to in Section 10-1.2(e) nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this Article. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. Failure to obtain an approved inspection within 180 days of the previous approved inspection shall constitute suspension or abandonment. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed by the Building Official for the permit, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated prior to the expiration date. The Building Official shall record the extension of time granted. 
1.  If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void, expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, or a change in the primary contractor is made, a new permit covering the proposed or remaining construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. 
2.  If a new permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the Building Official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the work in place and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit. 
3.  Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection within 180 days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. 
4.  The fee for renewal, reissuance and extension of a permit shall be set forth by the City Council. 
5.  Permits issued for the demolition of a structure shall expire 60 days from the date of issuance. For a justifiable cause, one extension of time for a period not exceeding 30 days may be allowed. Such request shall be in writing to the Building Official. 
6.  Unless otherwise stated in this Article, a permit shall be valid for a period not exceeding two years from the date of issuance. 
b.  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the Building Official, are hazardous or complex, the Building Official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity to the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the Building Official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity to the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes referred to in Section 10-1.2(e). In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the Building Official. The Building Official shall ensure that any person conducting plans review is qualified as a plans examiner under F.S. ch. 468, pt. XII (F.S. § 468.601 et seq.) and that any person conducting inspections is qualified as a building inspector under F.S. ch. 468, pt. III (F.S. § 468.201 et seq.). 
c.  Plans. When the Building Official issues a permit, the Building Official shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of reviewed plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of reviewed drawings shall be retained by the Building Official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permit drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the Building Official or his authorized representative. 
d.  Work starting before permit issuance. Upon approval of the Building Official, the scope of work delineated in the building permit application and plans may be started prior to the final approval and issuance of the permit provided any work completed is entirely at risk of the permit applicant and the work does not proceed past the first required inspection. 
(6)  Fees. 
a.  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until fees authorized under F.S. § 553.80 have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid. 
b.  Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the Building Official's approval or the necessary permits shall be subject to a penalty of double (200 percent) the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees or as provided by City Council resolution. This provision shall not apply to emergency work when delay would clearly have placed life or property in imminent danger, but in all such cases the required permits must be obtained within three business days and any unreasonable delay in obtaining those permits shall result in the charge of a double fee in addition to the required permit fees. The payment of a double fee shall not preclude or be deemed a substitute for prosecution for commencing work without first obtaining a permit. The Building Official may grant extensions of time or waive fees when justifiable cause has been demonstrated in writing. 
c.  Accounting. The Building Official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
d.  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the schedule as established by City Council.

7.  Administrative appeals. 
8.  Violations. 
9.  Other fees as established by City Council resolution. 
f.  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the Building Official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the Building Official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. The permit valuation may be calculated using the latest building valuation data published by the Southern Building Code Congress International or other applicable model code organization, at the option of the Building Official. 
(7)  Inspections. 
a.  Existing building inspections. Before issuing a permit, the Building Official may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems for which an application has been received for a permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install or change the occupancy. He shall inspect all buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems, from time to time, during and upon completion of the work for which a permit was issued.

A certificate required by any provision of this Article shall not be based on such reports unless the same are recorded by the building code inspector or the architect or engineer performing building code inspections in a manner specified by the Building Official. The Building Official shall ensure that all persons making such inspections shall be certified in accordance to F.S. ch. 468. 
d.  Inspections prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy or completion. The Building Official shall inspect or cause to be inspected, at various intervals, all construction or work for which a permit is required, and a final inspection shall be made of every building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system upon completion, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion. In performing inspections, the Building Official shall give first priority to inspections of the construction, addition or renovation to any facilities owned or controlled by a state university, state community college or public school district. 
e.  Posting of permit. Work requiring a permit shall not commence until the permit holder or his agent posts the permit card in a conspicuous place on the premises.
