PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rayne, Louisiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1958 Code, as supplemented through July 10, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1958 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert D. Hebert, CMC/AAE, City Clerk, and Mr. Larry T. Richard, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-3. - Catchlines of sections. 
    The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

(Code 1958, § 1-3)

Sec. 1-9. - Amendments to Code; effect of new ordinances; amendatory language. 
(a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion therein. When subsequent ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions, may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the board of aldermen. 
(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Rayne, Louisiana, is hereby amended to read as follows:...."

(Code 1958, § 1-6) 
Sec. 1-10. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the board of aldermen. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and general ordinances passed by the board of aldermen during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete. The new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-11. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
(Code 1958, § 1-7) 
Sec. 1-12. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any provision of this Code and where no specific penalty is provided therefore, the violation of any provision of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code shall continue constitutes a separate offense. Punishment by imprisonment a provided in this section may include mandatory performance of manual labor on the public streets or not, at the discretion of the court imposing such penalty. Where punishment by imprisonment, as provided in this section does not include mandatory labor on the public street, and the prisoner so sentenced shall be willing of his own free will to perform manual labor upon any of the public roads, streets or public buildings, works or improvements inside or outside of the jail or upon any cemetery or graveyard, the chief of police shall, with the consent of the sentencing court, set the prisoner to work upon labor to be determined from time to time by the mayor and board of aldermen in any regular or special meeting. This [The] prisoners shall always remain under the custody and control of the police. Any prisoner not sentenced to work on the public streets by voluntarily consenting to work under the provisions of this section shall have as many days taken off or remitted from his sentence as he shall have worked, provided always that he shall have demonstrated good behavior during the term of his imprisonment and custody.

(Code 1958, §§ 2-6.1-2-9, 2-29; Ord. No. 980, 2-10-03) 
Sec. 2-95. - Leave. 
(a)  Eligibility of full-time employees; types of leave enumerated. Full-time employees shall be eligible for annual leave, sick leave, family and medical leave, civil leave, funeral leave, military leave, education leave, maternity leave, and leave of absence without pay, as provided in this section. 
(b)  Annual leave. Annual leave is leave with pay granted to a full-time employee for the purpose of rehabilitation, restoration and maintenance of work efficiency, or transaction of personal affairs. For the first six years of full-time employment, each employee shall be credited with 12 days of annual leave on his employment anniversary date. Each employee with between seven and 14 years of service as a full-time employee shall be credited with 15 days of annual leave annually on his employment anniversary date. Each employee with over 14 years of service as a full-time employee shall be credited with 18 days of annual leave annually on his employment anniversary date. An employee may not carry over or accumulate annual leave from one employment anniversary date to another except as provided under rule VIII, section 1.3(a), (b), (c) of the Municipal Employees Civil Service Rules and Regulations. Annual leave may be taken as earned by an employee with the approval of the employee's department head. However, annual leave is permissive and may be denied by the employee's department head or the mayor when conditions are such that the ordinary work of the city could not be performed adequately if annual leave were granted. Annual leave may not be taken in less than one-half-day increments. The mayor or authorized department head may require an employee, other than a police officer, to take annual leave whenever in his administrative judgment such action would be in the best interest of the city. The chief of police may require police personnel to take annual leave whenever in his administrative judgment such action would be in the best interest of the city. No employee shall be granted any annual leave not credited to the employee's account at the time the absence occurs. Upon termination, all annual leave accrued by an employee for which he is not paid upon termination shall be canceled. 
(c)  Sick leave. Sick leave is leave with pay granted a full-time employee who is suffering with a disability which prevents him from performing his usual duties and responsibilities or who requires medical, dental or optical consultation or treatment. After an employee's first full-time employment anniversary date, sick leave may also be used for immediate family. For this purpose, the term "immediate family" includes spouse, child, grandchild, mother, father, grandparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother and sister. Sick leave with pay is not a right, which an employee may demand, but a privilege granted by the city. Leave from work with pay may be charged as sick leave if the absence is due to sickness, bodily injury, quarantine, required physical or dental examination or treatment, or exposure to a contagious disease when continued work might jeopardize the health of others. All such absences except those resulting from intemperance or immorality shall be charged against the sick leave credit of the employee. Sick leave credits accumulated by each employee as of the effective date of Ordinance No. 918 shall be retained. Each full-time employee shall earn sick leave at the rate of one workday for each month worked. However, no employee may accumulate more than 12 days of sick leave per year. The mayor shall determine when a doctor's certificate is required and under what conditions certificates are required. Department heads shall be responsible for the application of this provision so that there will be no abuse of sick leave privileges. Employees who resign or who are dismissed from employment shall not be paid for any accrued sick leave and all such sick leave shall be canceled with the exception of retirement. Upon notification to the appointing authority of his intention to retire, an employee may, at his election, use accrued sick leave (not to exceed 120 days) towards extension of his retirement date. The employee would receive sick leave pay until the accrued dates are used at which time his retirement would become effective. 
(1)  The minimum requirements for retirement must be met prior to election of this plan. 
(2)  The employee's rate of pay, for the period of time equal to his unused sick leave, shall be fixed as of the date of election of this plan. 
(3)  The employee shall not be entitled to pay raises which occur during this period under this plan. 
(4)  The employee shall not earn additional sick or annual leave under this plan (leave on leave). 
(5)  The employee must notify the appointing authority 30 days prior to the start of using accrued sick days to extend retirement date. 
The mayor or authorized department head may place an employee, other than a police officer, on sick leave when the employee asserts the need to be absent from the workplace because of the employee's illness or injury. The chief of police may place personnel on sick leave when the employee asserts the need to be absent from the workplace because of the employee's illness or injury. No employee shall be granted any sick leave not credited to the employee's account at the time the absence occurs. 
(d)  Family and medical leave. Each eligible employee under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 must substitute accumulated annual leave and sick leave for any part or all of the weeks of leave to which the employee is entitled under that act. An employee on family and medical leave shall report periodically during the leave period on his leave status and intention to return to work. An employee who has taken family and medical leave shall provide a certificate signed by a doctor to support his claim for leave for his own serious health condition or to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent. If the leave is due to the employee's own medical condition, the certificate must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his position. If the leave is to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent, the certificate must include an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to care for the child, spouse, or parent. The city may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the city, at its own expense, may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the city and the employee. If an employee takes such leave on an intermittent or on a reduced leave schedule that reduces the employee's usual number of hours worked per week or per workday, the city may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates the leave than the employee's regular position, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits. An employee who takes such leave to care for a newborn child or a child which has been placed with the employee for adoption or foster care may not take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the city and the employee agree to such an arrangement. 
(e)  Civil leave. An employee shall be given time off without loss of pay, annual leave, or sick leave when: 
(1)  Performing jury duty. 
(2)  Summoned to appear as a witness before a court, grand jury, or other public body or commission, provided that for purposes of this provision a plaintiff or defendant shall not be considered a witness. Nor does this provision apply to an employee summoned as a witness as a result of employment other than municipal employment. 
(3)  Performing emergency civilian duty in relation to national defense. 
(4)  The mayor determines that he is prevented by an act of God from performing duty. 
(5)  The mayor determines that because of local conditions or celebrations it is impracticable for employees to work. 
(6)  The employee is ordered to report for preinduction examination incident to possible entry into the military forces of the United States. 
(7)  The employee is a member of the National Guard and is ordered to active duty incident to local emergency, act of God, civil or criminal insurrection, civil or criminal disobedience, or similar occurrences of an extraordinary and emergency nature which threatens or affects the peace or property of the people. 
Employees may keep all fees received from jury duty in addition to regular compensation. Police officers may not receive or keep any witness fees for appearing in mayor's court in connection with their official duties while on duty. 
(f)  Funeral leave. An employee may be granted time off without loss of pay, annual leave or sick leave when attending the funeral or burial rites of a mother, mother-in-law, father, father-in-law, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent, grandchild, brother-in-law or sister-in-law; provided, however, that such time off shall not exceed three days on any one occasion. If additional time is needed, an employee may revert to annual leave. 
(g)  Military leave. An employee who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States is entitled to military leave with pay when placed on military active duty for training by order of an authority of the Armed Forces of the United States and when given constructive credit for such training. The maximum military leave with pay for military active duty for training is ten working days per calendar year. An employee may apply for but shall be required to take annual leave or compensatory leave for military purposes. However, the employee shall be entitled to leave without pay for a period of up to 90 consecutive calendar days: 
(1)  When ordered to military active duty. 
(2)  When placed on military active duty for training. 
(3)  When placed on military training duty and the maximum authorized military leave with pay has been exhausted or is not authorized. 
Military active duty means full-time duty in the active military service, other than military active duty for training. Military active duty for training means full-time paid duty in the active military service for training purposes. Military training duty includes active and inactive duty for training such as annual two-week summer encampments and cruises, weekly and weekend drills or training meetings, attendance at service schools for refresher training or the upgrading of military skills, field exercises, and the like. 
(h)  Education leave. A leave of absence at full or part pay must be granted by the mayor and board to permit a full-time employee to take courses of study which will better equip the employee to perform his duties for the city. 
(i)  Maternity leave. Absence from work caused by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions is considered to be a temporary disability which prevents an employee from performing the usual duties associated with employment. An employee may take up to six weeks of sick leave for maternity reasons, unless a doctor certifies, in writing, that an extended amount of time is needed due to medical causes. If accrued sick leave is exhausted, and additional leave is needed due to illness or disability, annual leave may be used, subject to the approval of the appropriate department head. 
(j)  Leave of absence without pay. Leave of absence without pay means time off from work without pay granted by the mayor, or authorized department head, or imposed by the mayor, or authorized department head, for an unapproved absence. The mayor, or authorized department head, may extend leave of absence without pay to any employee for a period not to exceed six months, provided that such leave shall not prolong the period of his appointment. 
(Code 1958, § 2-30; Ord. No. 943, 3-9-98) 
Sec. 2-96. - Filling vacancies. 
(a)  The term "vacancy," as used in this section, includes a new position and the filling of a vacancy in an existing position. Vacancies shall be publicized in order that qualified persons shall be encouraged to apply and qualify. When a vacancy is a position listed in R.S. 33:404(A)(3), it shall be filled as provided by law. A vacancy in any other position shall be filled from among qualified applicants using the guidelines as set out in the city municipal employee's civil service rules and regulations. 
(b)  A personnel committee is established which shall consist of two members of the board appointed by the mayor who shall serve as chairperson. The committee shall ensure all employees that every effort will be made to see that they are treated fairly, given the opportunity to advance when possible, and have the right to discuss work problems, salary or any job-related subject with the mayor and board by going through proper channels. 
(c)  Applicants shall complete the application form provided by the city. The application form shall require the applicant to disclose the conviction of any crime. Applicants for a position which requires the operation of a motor vehicle shall provide proof of a valid driver's license. Any applicant falsifying any information on the application may be dropped for consideration of employment.

Sec. 2-98. - Probation. 
(a)  Each appointment shall commence with a probationary period of six months. This period allows the city to determine whether the employee's performance meets accepted municipal standards and the employee with an opportunity to determine whether he is satisfied with the position. Upon agreement by the employee and the mayor, this probationary period may be extended for an additional period not to exceed six months. 
(b)  During this probationary period, no classification or pay change shall occur and employment can be terminated by the city or by the employee without notice. 
(c)  Successful completion of the probationary period does not require any classification or pay change nor is such successful completion of the probationary period to be interpreted as a contract with the employee for employment for any definite or specified term. 
(Code 1958, § 2-33) 
Sec. 2-99. - Development.

(b)  Attendance at workshops, conventions, seminars, short courses or professional meetings which will enhance the development of employees is encouraged. The attendees may be asked to provide a written summary of their activities or to conduct short courses or workshops for other employees when they return.

Complaints must be made within one year after occurrence of the alleged prohibited conduct. All complaints of sexual harassment, and information and proceedings relating thereto shall be kept in strict confidence except as otherwise specified in this subsection (l). 
(4)  The department head shall, in a timely manner, conduct an investigation of the complaint, interviewing appropriate persons, examining relevant records, and consulting with and utilizing any appropriate employee.

(8)  The record maintained with respect to each complaint of sexual harassment shall contain the written complaint, if any; any written statement produced during the investigation; the recommendation of the department head; if a formal hearing is conducted, a record thereof in a form determined by the mayor, the mayor's statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law; and the mayor's written determination.

(j)  Violation of section. Violation of this section shall be grounds for discipline, including dismissal. An unexplained positive test result shall be grounds for action by the mayor. This action may require the employee or volunteer to submit to a mandatory substance abuse program, psychological counseling or medical treatment, all at the employee's or volunteer's expense. Each case shall be dealt with on an individual basis with all facts and circumstances being taken into consideration. Discipline, including dismissal, may result from cases of illegal use of a nonprescribed controlled substance or controlled dangerous substance or abuse of prescription medicine. Any employee with a positive alcohol test result for the first time shall be subject to suspension without pay for a period of five days. A second positive test shall result in dismissal. 
(k)  Confidentiality of information; exceptions.

c.  Each customer shall survey the activities and processes which receives water service and shall report to the water purveyor if cross-connections exist and the degree of hazard. Upon a finding of hazard, the customer shall cause the appropriate backflow prevention assembly or method to be installed in a timely fashion. 
d.  For existing water services, the water purveyor may inspect the premises to determine the degree of hazard. When high hazard cross-connections are found the water purveyor shall: 
1.  Develop a schedule of compliance which the customer shall follow, or 
2.  Terminate the water service until a backflow prevention assembly or method for containment required by the Water Purveyor has been installed. 
e.  Failure of the water purveyor to notify a customer that the customer has a high hazard cross-connection and should install backflow prevention assemblies or methods for containment in no way relieves the customer of the responsibility to comply with all requirements of this section. 
(e)  Customer duties. 
(1)  The customer shall be responsible for ensuring that no cross-connections exist without approved backflow protection within the customer's premises starting at the point of service from the public potable water system. 
(2)  The customer shall, at the customer's own expense, cause installation, operation, testing and maintenance of the backflow prevention assemblies required by the administrative authority. The customer shall advise the water purveyor in advance of when a device is to be tested to allow the water purveyor the opportunity to witness the test. 
(3)  Within 15 days after testing and/or repairs are completed, the customer shall provide the administrative authority with copies of records of the installation and of all tests and repairs made to the backflow prevention assembly. 
(4)  In the event of a backflow incident, the customer shall immediately notify the Water Purveyor of the incident and take steps to confine the contamination or pollution. Water service will not be restored until corrective action is taken and approved after inspection by the water purveyor. 
(5)  In accordance with section D108.3.4 of the LSPC, 2000 Edition, the customer shall maintain records of installations, tests, repairs, overhauls, or replacements of backflow prevention devices or methods for at least five years and, upon request, such records shall be made available to the administrative authority. 
(f)  Requirements. 
(1)  Water purveyor requirements: 
a.  For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the water purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the customer by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed, however, this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s) in question. 
b.  The water purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer or an air gap for which a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation. 
c.  The water purveyor shall notify the customer by letter of any failure to comply at the time of the first re-inspection or immediately following the first re-inspection. The water purveyor will allow an additional 15 days for the correction. In the event the customer fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second re-inspection, the water purveyor will notify the customer by letter that the water service to the customer's premises will be terminated within five days from the customer's receipt of such letter. In the event that the customer informs the water purveyor of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the water purveyor but in no case will exceed an additional 30 days. 
d.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the water purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately. 
e.  The water purveyor shall have on file a list of private contractors who are certified backflow device testers and/or repairers. All charges for these tests, repairs, etc., will be paid by the customer of the building or property. 
f.  The water purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the approval of this program by the city council and mayor, during the calendar year. (2008) Initial focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises. 
(2)  Customer requirements: 
a.  The customer shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on his premises. 
b.  The customer, after having been informed by a letter from the water purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test or have tested, any and all backflow prevention devices or methods on his premises. 
c.  The customer shall correct any malfunction of the backflow prevention device or method which is revealed by periodic testing. 
d.  The Customer shall inform the water purveyor of any proposed or modified cross-connection and also any existing cross-connection of which the customer is aware but has not been found by the water purveyor. 
e.  The customer shall not install a bypass around any backflow prevention device or method unless there is a backflow prevention device or method of the same type on the bypass. Customers who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) or method(s) must supply additional devices or methods necessary to allow testing to take place. 
f.  The customer shall install backflow prevention devices or methods in a manner approved by the water purveyor and in conformance with the installation requirements of section 606 of the LSPC, 2000 Edition. In addition, devices having an atmospheric port or discharge shall be installed such that the port or discharge point is located at least 24 inches above the highest flood level which may have occurred in the previous ten-year period. 
g.  The customer shall install only backflow prevention devices or methods approved by the water purveyor. 
h.  A customer that has a private potable water well is required to have an "air gap" at all times between the plumbing served by the private well and the plumbing served by the city water system. If the water system knows that a private well is on the premises, they may choose to require a backflow preventer downstream of the water meter in addition to the air gap. But in all cases an air gap is required because the private well is not monitored according to the Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. 
i.  In the event the customer installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the water purveyor's side of the backflow prevention device or method, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed. 
j.  The customer shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semi-annual device or method testing, re-testing in the case that the device or method fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance with the water purveyor's requirements. 
(g)  Required backflow prevention assemblies or methods for containment. 
(1)  Water service assemblies: An air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly is required for water services having one or more potential cross-connections which the administrative authority classifies as high hazard as defined by tables D104 and D105. 
(2)  Fire protection system assemblies: 
a.  All proposed installations of fire suppression systems shall be reviewed by the city department of inspections to determine the appropriate type of backflow prevention devices or methods required. 
b.  For all proposed fire suppression systems using antifreeze, a reduced pressure principle (#10 on Table D104) backflow prevention device shall be installed at the point of entry. The customer shall provide the city with the design and chemical usage of the fire suppression system. 
c.  All existing fire suppression systems shall meet the requirements of subsection (g)(2) above. An inspection by a fire suppression specialist shall be done to determine whether antifreeze has been utilized in the suppression system. The inspection shall be done at the expense of the customer. If it cannot be certified that antifreeze has been used, then a backflow prevention device shall be installed as prescribed by table d104 and as approved by the city department of inspections. Installation shall be at the expense of the customer. The required backflow prevention devices or methods shall be installed at the time the system is repaired or changed, or within 12 months after adoption of this ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
d.  In the event cross-connections, such as those found in using auxiliary water supply systems or in providing other water additives such as foaming agents, are necessary for the proper operation of the fire suppression system, then an air gap or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed in an approved manner. 
(h)  Registration. 
(1)  Technician registration: Any backflow prevention assembly technician licensed by the state must register with the administrative authority before performing work within the city. Any licensed backflow prevention assembly technician shall include his or her state registration number on all correspondence and forms required by or associated with this section. 
(2)  General tester registration: Any backflow prevention assembly general tester shall present a copy of his/her testing certificate from a nationally recognized backflow certification organization and shall register with the administrative authority before performing work within the city. 
(i)  Non-compliance by registered technicians or general testers. 
(1)  The local registration of a technician or general tester may be revoked or suspended for a period of up to two years for non-compliance with this section. 
(2)  Any of the following conditions constitute non-compliance: 
a.  Improper testing or repair of backflow prevention assemblies or methods; 
b.  Improper reporting of the results of testing or of repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies or methods; 
c.  Failure to meet registration requirements; 
d.  Related unethical practices. 
(j)  Installation of backflow prevention assemblies or methods. 
(1)  The required backflow prevention assemblies or methods for containment shall be installed in the manner recommended by the manufacturer and in accord with the requirements of section 606 of the LSPC, 2000 Edition, immediately following the meter or as close to that location as deemed practical by the administrative authority. In any case, it shall be located upstream from any branch piping. Installation at this point does not eliminate the responsibility of the customer to protect the water supply system from contamination or pollution between the backflow prevention assembly or methods and the water main. 
(2)  Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed so as to be protected from flooding. The port or discharge point shall be installed such that it is located at least 24 inches above the highest flood level which may have occurred in the previous ten-year period. 
(3)  Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall not be installed in underground vaults or pits, unless a gravity drainage system (designed by a Louisiana registered engineer) for the particular site has been approved by the state health officer. (The intent of the exception to this section is to possibly allow below grade installations on particular sites or lots having sufficiently hilly ground at the proposed location of the device such that when the vault or pit is constructed it may be equipped with positive gravity drainage openings as to prevent any part of the device from being submerged. A recommended design standard for such an installation may be found in sections 606.4.1 and 606.4.2 of the 1994 Standard Plumbing Code.) 
(4)  All backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be protected from freezing. Those devices used for seasonal services may be removed in lieu of being protected from freezing; however, the devices must be reinstalled and tested by a registered backflow prevention assembly technician prior to service being reactivated. 
(5)  If hot water is used within the water supply system, thermal expansion shall be provided for when installing a backflow prevention assembly or method for containment in accordance with section 613.2 of the LSPC, 2000 Edition. 
(6)  Provisions shall be made to convey the discharge of water from reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies or methods to a suitable drain through an air gap. 
(7)  No backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be installed in a place where they would create a safety hazard, such as, but not limited to, over an electrical panel, or above ceiling level. 
(8)  If interruption of water service during testing and repair of backflow prevention assemblies or methods for containment is unacceptable to the customer, another backflow prevention assembly or method of equivalent or higher protection, sized to handle the temporary water flow needed during the time of testing or repair, shall be installed in parallel piping. 
(9)  All backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be installed so that they are accessible for testing. 
(10)  All shut-off valves shall conform with the current edition of the 2000 Edition Louisiana State Plumbing Code requirements for either ball or resilient seat gate valves. Full port ball valves shall be used on assemblies installed in piping two inches or smaller, and full port resilient wedge-type shut off valves on assemblies installed in piping larger than two inches. 
(k)  Testing of backflow prevention assemblies or methods. 
(1)  Testing of backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be performed by a backflow prevention assembly technician or by a backflow prevention assembly general tester registered with the administrative authority. The costs of tests required in the following paragraphs shall be borne by the customer. 
(2)  Backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be tested upon installation; when cleaned, repaired, or overhauled; when relocated; and, shall be tested and inspected at least once annually. Backflow prevention devices shall be tested in accordance with CAN/CSA Standard B64.10-1994 or ASSE Standard 5010-1998. 
(3)  Backflow prevention assemblies or methods which are in place, but have been out of operation for more than three months, shall be tested before being put back into operation. Backflow prevention assemblies or methods used in seasonal applications shall be tested before being put into operation each season. 
(4)  Any backflow prevention assembly or method which fails a periodic test shall be repaired or replaced by a backflow prevention assembly technician when such assembly is located on private property. When such a device is located on public property, a backflow prevention assembly general tester may repair or replace the device if authorized by the water purveyor. When water service has been terminated for non-compliance, the backflow prevention assembly or method shall be repaired or replaced prior to the resumption of water service. Backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall be re-tested by a registered backflow prevention assembly technician or by a backflow prevention assembly general tester immediately after repair or replacement. 
(5)  The city department of inspections may require backflow prevention assemblies or methods to be tested at any time in addition to the annual testing requirement. 
(6)  The registered backflow prevention assembly technician or backflow prevention assembly general tester shall report the testing of backflow prevention assembly or method to the customer and to the administrative authority within 15 days of the test. 
(7)  The administrative authority may require, at its own cost, additional tests of individual backflow prevention assemblies or methods as it shall deem necessary to verify test procedures and results. 
(l)  Repair of backflow prevention assemblies or methods. 
(1)  All repairs to backflow prevention assemblies or methods on private property shall be performed by a licensed plumber holding a special "water supply protection specialist" endorsement on his plumbing license, herein defined as "backflow prevention assembly technician." 
(2)  After obtaining approval from the water purveyor, a "backflow prevention assembly general tester" may perform repairs to backflow prevention assemblies or methods located on public property. 
(3)  The registered backflow prevention assembly technician or backflow prevention assembly general tester shall not change the design, material, or operational characteristics of a backflow prevention assembly or method during repair or maintenance, and shall use only original manufacturer replacement parts, if available; if not available, shall use replacement parts approved by the Department of Inspections. 
(4)  The registered backflow prevention assembly technician or backflow prevention assembly general tester shall report the repair, overhaul, or replacement of any backflow prevention assembly or method to the customer and to the City of Rayne Water Purveyor. 
(m)  Customer non-compliance. 
(1)  The water service may be discontinued in the case of non-compliance with this ordinance. Non-compliance includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  Refusal to allow the administrative authority or water purveyor access to the property to inspect for cross-connection; 
b.  Removal of a backflow prevention assembly or method which has been required by the administrative authority. 
c.  Bypassing of a backflow prevention assembly or method which has been required by the administrative authority. 
d.  Providing inadequate backflow prevention when potential or actual cross-connections exist. 
e.  Failure to install a backflow prevention assembly or method which has been required by the administrative authority. 
f.  Failure to test and/or properly repair a backflow prevention assembly or method as required by the administrative authority. 
g.  Failure to comply with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(n)  Customer notification policy. 
(1)  If the water purveyor has not received testing results by the annual testing due date, they will issue a second notice to customer giving the customer an additional 30-day deadline to have results submitted. 
(2)  If customer fails to submit results within the 30-day extension period, a final notice will be sent to the customer notifying them that water services will be discontinued. 
(o)  Penalty for violation. Apart from any other penalties or sanctions imposed by local or state laws, any person found guilty of violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished in accordance with section 1-12. Each day that a violation is allowed to continue shall constitute a separate and distinct violation.

(1)  The cost to the city of maintenance of the immovable or improvements; and 
(2)  The cost to the city of demolishing or removing, or both, a building or other structure situated upon the immovable or improvements, and all attorney fees incurred by the city in connection with such demolition or removal. 
(b)  The word "maintenance" shall include, but not be limited to, grass cutting, weed abatement and trash and garbage removal. 
(c)  The privilege and lien shall be preserved and enforced only after the owner has refused, after notification by the city and reasonable opportunity to be heard, to pay the costs incurred by the city. 
(d)  The privilege and lien shall be preserved by the filing and recording of an affidavit signed by the mayor of the city in the mortgage office of the parish in which the immovable is situated. The affidavit shall include a description of the property sufficient to reasonably identify the immovable and a statement of facts listing the approximate cost or costs incurred by the city. 
(e)  The privilege and lien shall be enforced by ordinary process in the district court having jurisdiction of the immovable within three years after it is perfected. Alternatively, the privilege and lien may be enforced by assessing the amount of the privilege and lien against the immovable as a tax against the immovable, to be enforced and collected as any ordinary property tax lien to be assessed against the property. Such lien and privilege may be collected in the manner fixed for collection of taxes and shall be subject to the same civil penalties for delinquencies. After the city has incurred such costs as constitute the lien and privilege on the property, the mayor and/or any director of any community development department of the city may send an attested bill of such costs and expenses which constitute the lien and privilege to the director of administration, who shall add the amount of such bill to the next tax bill of the owner. The lien obtained by the city pursuant to proper notification and filing shall include not only the costs provided for in subsection (a) of this section but shall include all attorney's fees and/or all costs of court incurred in the locating of the owner, the notification of the owner, and the enforcement and collection of the amount secured by the lien against the immovable and the improvements. If authorized by municipal ordinance, the city may also recover interest on the amounts secured by the lien. The interest shall not exceed the rate of legal interest provided in Civil Code, article 2924 and shall be computed from the date of recordation of the lien until paid. The city's privilege and lien shall prime all other liens or privileges against the property filed after the notice to the owner to show cause is filed with the recorder of mortgages pursuant to R.S. 33:4762(D), regardless of the date on which the city's lien and privilege is perfected, except that the city's lien and privilege will not prime other tax liens against the property. 
(f)  The lien shall not be cancelled until after payment of all amounts, including costs, attorney fees and interest. 
(g)  In addition to the lien and enforcement procedures authorized under this section, the city has a cause of action against the owner personally for the costs incurred by the city, if such owner is not indigent and has the ability to pay a judgment obtained by the city. Such action may be brought by ordinary proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(h)  If property, which may be subject to a lien and privilege granted in favor of a city under this section, is owned in indivision and the owners in indivision, with their proportionate share in the property, are listed separately by the tax assessor on the ad valorem tax roll for the city, then the city shall notify each owner in indivision of his liability under this section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1048, adopted Oct. 11, 2010, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 42-31-42-94, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1958, §§ 8A and Ord. No. 954, adopted Feb. 14, 2000. 

DIVISION 1. - ADMINISTRATION-STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 42-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Louisiana has in statute L.R.S. 38:84 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Rayne, Louisiana, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 42-32. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Rayne are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 42-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 42-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 42-35. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.

    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).

    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) - See flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area - See area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction - (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) section 42-37, (ii) subsection 42-44(8), or (iii) subsection 42-49(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation or one foot above the crown of the street, whichever is greater. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 42-45(1), is satisfied. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure within zones X, shaded and unshaded as shown on the flood insurance rate map, shall have the lowest floor elevated to one foot above the crown of the street. The contractor (with the floodplain administrator as witness), a registered professional engineer, architect or licensed land surveyor shall submit a certificate to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or one foot above the crown of the street, whichever is greater, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. New construction or substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure within zone X, shaded or unshaded as shown on the flood insurance rate map, shall have the lowest floor elevated to one foot above the crown of the street. The contractor (with the floodplain administrator as witness), a registered professional engineer, architect or licensed land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.

(4)  Manufactured homes. 
(a)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(b)  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the longitudinal structural I beam of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(c)  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The bottom of the longitudinal structural I beam of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 42-45 (1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 1053, 4-11-11) 
Sec. 42-49. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 42-32, 42-33 and 42-34 of this article. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 42-38; section 42-45; and the provisions of division 3 of this article. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 42-37 or subsection 42-44(8) of this article. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

Sec. 42-50. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or one foot above the crown of the street, whichever is greater, or 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or one foot above the crown of the street, whichever is greater, or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 42-45 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1048, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 1053, 4-11-11) 
Sec. 42-51. - Severability.

In the case of tangible personal property which has acquired a state tax situs and is thereafter transported outside the state for repairs performed outside the state and is thereafter returned to the state, the cost price shall be deemed to be the actual cost of any parts and/or materials used in performing such repairs, if applicable labor charges are separately stated on the invoice. If the applicable labor charges are not separately stated on the invoice, it shall be presumed that the cost price is the total charge reflected on the invoice. Cost price shall not include the supplying and installation of board roads to oil field operators if the installation charges are separately billed to the customer at the time of installation. In the case of interchangeable components located in the state, a taxpayer may elect to determine the cost price of such components as follows: 
(1)  The taxpayer shall send to the secretary written notice of the calendar month selected by the taxpayer as the first month for the determination of cost price under this definition (the "first month"). The taxpayer may select any month. The taxpayer shall send to the secretary notice of an election to designate a first month on the first day of the designated first month, or 90 days from July 1, 1990, whichever is later. 
(2)  For the first month and each month thereafter, cost price shall be based and use tax shall be paid only on 1/60 of the aggregate cost price of the interchangeable components deployed and earning revenue within the state during the month, without regard to any credit or other consideration for state, political subdivision or school board use tax previously paid on such interchangeable components. 
(3)  Any election made under this definition shall be irrevocable for a period of 60 consecutive months inclusive of the first month. If at any time after the 60-month period the taxpayer revokes its election, no credit or other consideration for use taxes paid pursuant thereto shall be applied to any use tax liability arising after such revocation.

Cost price, for purposes of the use tax imposed by the state and its political subdivisions, shall exclude any amount that a manufacturer pays directly to a dealer of the manufacturer's product for the purpose of reducing and that actually results in an equivalent reduction in the retail cost price of that product. This exclusion shall not apply to the value of the coupons that dealers accept from purchasers as part payment of the sales price and that are redeemable by the dealers through manufacturers or their agents.

The collector shall, within five days after such registration, issue without charge to each dealer who purchases or imports for resale, a certificate of authority empowering such dealer to collect the tax from the purchaser, and duplicates therefor, for each additional place of business of such dealer. Each certificate or duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable. Such certificate of authority shall be prominently displayed in all places of business of the dealer.

Such certificate shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the collector upon the dealer's ceasing to do business at the place therein named.

(1)  The tax levied by this article on any such vehicle shall be paid to the vehicle commissioner as the agent of the collector of revenue of the state at the time of application for a certificate of title or vehicle registration license and no certificate of title or vehicle registration license shall be issued until the tax has been paid.

(3)  It is not the intention of this section to grant an exemption from the tax levied by this article to any sale, use, item or transaction which has heretofore been taxable, and this section shall not be construed as so doing. It is the intention of this section to transfer the collection of sales and use tax on vehicles from the vendor to the vehicle commissioner as agent for the collector of revenue of the state, and to provide a method of collection of the tax directly from the vendee or user by the vehicle commissioner as agent of the collector of revenue in accordance with an agreement by and between the collector of revenue or the vehicle commissioner as agent therefor and the board of aldermen, the execution of which agreement is hereby authorized. Such tax so collected for the collector of revenue shall be paid to the board of aldermen and sent to the collector as soon as possible, and in any event at least once each quarter, all in accordance with the agreement. 
(4)  The provisions contained in section 70-31 which exclude isolated or occasional sales from the definition of a sale at retail are not to apply to the sale of vehicles which are the subject to this subsection.

Thereafter, the collector shall grant a hearing to such dealer, if a hearing has been requested, and may make an order confirming, modifying or vacating any such finding or assessment. The filing of any such protest shall not abate any penalty for nonpayment, nor shall it stay the right of the collector to collect the tax in any manner provided in this section unless the dealer shall furnish security of a kind and in an amount satisfactory to the collector.

(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities but in no case will any user discharge solids greater than one-half-inch in any dimension. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater or unless specific written authorization is given by the city, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. The city reserves the right, at its own discretion, to establish upper pH limits and such upper pH limits will be described in the industrial users' wastewater contribution permit. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its LPDES and/or the receiving water quality standards. 
(7)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(8)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40°C (104°F) unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature. 
(9)  Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation. 
(10)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(11)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(12)  Any visible free animal or vegetable oil and grease which would cause the POTW interference, pass through, or treatment upset, or total animal or vegetable oil and grease exceeding 100 milligrams per liter. This limit will be monitored by the city when deemed appropriate by the city. 
(13)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
(14)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(15)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, unless specifically authorized by the superintendent.

Storage, handling, disposal and transportation of the waste material removed from pre-discharge facilities shall be done according to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations that pertain to the type and/or class of waste generated. Any industry with grease and sand trap pretreatment tanks shall keep accurate records as to when the tank was cleaned, who performed the cleaning, and the method and location of disposal of the contents removed. These records shall be made available to the superintendent or his representative upon request. This information shall be kept on file by the user for a minimum of three years. 
(c)  Suspension of services. The city shall suspend the wastewater treatment service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes or has the ability to cause interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its LPDES Permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment services shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City of Rayne shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection or suspension of electric and water services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of occurrence. 
    Any user who is found to have violated, or continues to violate, an order of the city or who willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provisions of this section shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
