PREFACE 
    This Code, Subpart A constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances 
of the City of Treasure Island, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code, Subpart A were the 1985 Code, as 
supplemented through February 17, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. 
The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. 
The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the 
adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader 
can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included 
herein. 
    The chapters of the Code, Subpart A have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the 
various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related 
sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the 
state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code, Subpart A is the same system used in 
many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. 
The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the 
position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the 
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the 
same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for 
amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between 
sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles 
and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end 
of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article 
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New 
chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the 
alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and John 
Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bonnie Williams, Deputy City Clerk, and James Denhardt, City 
Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is 
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make 
the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-
day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-1. - How Code designated and cited.

Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
    In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances of the city, the following rules shall be 
observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the city commission, 
or the context clearly requires otherwise: 
    Charter. The term "Charter" shall mean the Charter of the City of Treasure Island, Florida, as printed

The Code consists of subparts A and B. While subpart A is a codification of general ordinances of the city 
and subpart B is a codification of ordinances pertaining to land development, the misclassification of a 
provision (i.e., the inclusion of a provision that pertains to land development in subpart A or the inclusion 
of a provision in subpart B that does not pertain to land development) does not excuse noncompliance 
with such provision. 
    Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done a certain length 
of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given or such act is done 
shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be 
counted.

to authorize the head of the department or other officer or employee to designate, delegate and authorize 
subordinates to perform the required act or perform the duty unless the terms of the provision or section 
specify otherwise. 
    F.S. Whenever the abbreviation "F.S." is used, it shall refer to the latest edition or supplement of the 
Florida Statutes. 
    Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and to 
firms, partnerships and corporations as well as to males. 
    Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three or more persons or officers shall be 
construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers.

and things as well as to one person and thing.

affirmation may be substituted for an oath; and in such cases the words "swear" and "sworn" shall be 
equivalent to the words "affirm" and "affirmed." 
    Or, and. "Or" may be read "and," and "and" may be read "or" if the sense requires it. 
    Owner. The word "owner," applied to a building or land, shall include any part owner, joint owner, 
tenant in common, tenant in partnership, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety of the whole or of a part of

alone or with others.

(f) ?The code enforcement board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day; however, 
the code enforcement board may, in its discretion, continue any case until the next agenda upon a 
showing of good cause at the time of or prior to the scheduled hearing. The code enforcement board

him a reasonable time to correct the violation.

the code enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical 
staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed 
as provided in section 2-161 to the violator. At the option of the code enforcement board, notice may 
additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 2-161. If the violation is 
corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the 
code inspector, the case may be presented to the code enforcement board even if the violation has 
been corrected prior to the hearing; and the notice shall so state. The notice shall also state that if 
the alleged violator fails to appear, that the hearing will take place in his absence. 
(d) ?If an alleged repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator of same, but is not 
required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon 
notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code enforcement board and request a 
hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall 
provide notice pursuant to section 2-161. The case may be presented to the code enforcement board

enforcement board, the code enforcement board may proceed with the hearing. 
(e) ?If the code inspector has reason to believe that a violation presents a serious threat to the public 
health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector 
shall make a reasonable effort to notify the alleged violator of the violation and of the hearing and 
may immediately notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement 
board shall conduct a hearing to determine if a violation exists and may enter appropriate orders.

State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.07. 


Sec. 2-164. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a) ?The code enforcement board, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the code 
enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation 
has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for 
each day the violation continues past the date set by the code enforcement board for compliance or, 
in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date 
the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a 
violation described in section 2-163(d), the code enforcement board shall notify the city commission, 
which may make all reasonable repairs required to bring the property into compliance and charge the 
violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. If 
a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a hearing 
shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If after due notice and hearing the 
code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the

State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09(2)(a). 


Sec. 2-165. - Factors determining amount of fine. 
    In determining the amount of fine authorized by section 2-164, if any, the code enforcement board 
shall consider the following factors: 
(1) ?The gravity of the violation; 
(2) ?Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and

State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09(2)(b). 


Sec. 2-166. - Reduction, elimination of fine. 
    The code enforcement board may reduce or eliminate a fine imposed by it pursuant to section 2-164. 
The request to reduce or eliminate a fine shall be made within 60 days of correcting the violation for which 
the fine was assessed. If the violator fails to appear before the code enforcement board because he did 
not receive actual notice of the hearing on his violation, and so long as the lack of actual notice was not 
the result of the violator's own act or omission, the code enforcement board may consider a request to 
reduce or eliminate a fine notwithstanding the request is untimely made. 
(Ord. No. 93-6, § 8 C., 12-7-93) 


Sec. 2-167. - Fine constitutes lien. 
    A certified copy of an order imposing a fine shall be recorded in the public records of the county and 
thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or 
personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in 
the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal 
property; but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A 
fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or 
until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this division, whichever first 
occurs. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this division runs in favor of the city commission, 
and the city commission may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. 
Upon filing and recording of such a lien, the lien shall be and constitute a lien superior in dignity to all 
other liens and encumbrances of whatever kind and character save and except ad valorem taxes levied 
and assessed by the city, county or state, and shall remain a lien against each such real or personal 
property owned by the violator until paid. 
    After three months from the filing of any such lien remaining unpaid, the code enforcement board 
may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this 
section may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Fla. Const., art. X, § 4.

State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09(3). 


Sec. 2-168. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided under section 2-167 shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the 
certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded unless within that time an action to foreclose 
on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the 
prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the 
foreclosure. The city commission shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a 
valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good 
against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice unless a notice of lis 
pendens is recorded. 
State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.10. 


Sec. 2-169. - Appeal. 
    An aggrieved party, including the city commission, may appeal a final administrative order of the 
code enforcement board to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be 
limited to appellate review of the record created before the code enforcement board. An appeal shall be 
filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 93-6, § 9, 12-7-93) 
State Law reference— Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.11. 


Sec. 2-170. - Notices. 
(a) ?All notices required pursuant to this article shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, 
return receipt requested; by hand delivery by a law enforcement officer or code inspector; or by 
leaving the notice at the alleged violator's usual place of residence with any person residing there 
who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice. 
(b) ?In addition to providing notices as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code 
enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication as follows: 
(1) ?Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four 
publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The 
newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and 
official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 
50.051. 
(2) ?In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b)(1) of this subsection, such notice may be 
posted for at least ten days in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon 
which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting 
shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the 
notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(c) ?Notice of publication may run concurrently with or may follow an attempt or attempts to provide 
notice by hand delivery or by mail. Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail 
notice in compliance with this section, together with proof of publication as required in this 
subsection, shall be sufficient to show that notice requirements of this division have been met without 
regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 


Sec. 2-276. - Purchasing procedures for goods, materials and services. 
(a) ?Expenditures up to $10,000.00. The city manager is authorized to approve expenditures up to 
$10,000.00 without prior approval of the city commission for the purchase of goods, materials, 
equipment or services, upon receipt of at least two written bids, telephone quotes or proposals, 
provided sufficient funding is available in the approved city budget. 
(b) ?Expenditures in excess of $10,000.00 . The city commission may authorize an expenditure in 
excess of $10,000.00 for goods, materials, equipment or services after the issuance of a request for 
proposal or bid and the receipt of sealed bids or proposals, which shall be publicly opened in a 
manner set forth in an administrative policy established by the city manager for bidding expenditures 
in excess of $10,000.00. 
(c) ?[Exceptions.] The requirements of subsection (b) are not intended to apply to routine operating 
expenses such as salaries, utilities and supplies for which budget appropriations have been made. 
Performance bonds and bid bonds may be required if deemed necessary by the city manager. 
(d) ?[Award of contract.] The city commission shall award the contract to the lowest responsive and 
responsible bidder. For the purpose of determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, the 
city commission may consider factors including the cost of the product or service; qualifications of 
the bidder; prior experience of the bidder in similar activities; prior work performed by the bidder on 
behalf of the city or other units of government or their agencies; and any other factors deemed 
relevant by the city commission in its sole discretion. If the city manager recommends the 
acceptance of a bid other than the bid with the lowest total price, the reason for the recommendation 
shall be given. 
(e) ?Rejection. The city commission may reject any or all bids if it is deemed in the best interests of the 
city to do so, and to rebid the proposed purchase. All bid proposals submitted to the city must 
address and conform to the bid specifications and the scope of the work to be performed. Any 
deviations or substitutions from the bid specifications or the scope of work must be identified with a 
written explanation. Failure to comply with the provisions of the bid specification may result in a 
rejection of the bid proposal. Incomplete bid proposals may be rejected by the city. The city reserves 
the right to waive minor technical defects in a bid submittal as determined in its sole discretion. A 
late-filed bid may be accepted if it has been postmarked, dropped off with a delivery service or 
otherwise placed in transit to the city prior to the time of bid opening so that the city is reasonably 
certain that the prices contained within the bid could not have been altered as a result of the opening 
of the bids that had been submitted by the time established for bid opening. 
(g) ?Applicability. The bid requirements set forth in this section shall not apply to professional services 
covered by the Florida Consultant's Competitive Negotiations Act which services shall be obtained 
following the procedures set forth by state statute. To the extent the monetary amounts or subject 
matters set forth in the Consultant's Competitive Negotiations Act are inapplicable to a proposed 
service agreement, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in this section. The requirements of 
this division may be waived by the city manager when purchasing used or surplus equipment 
provided that such a purchase is in the best interest of the city. 
(h) ?Exemptions. The following situations are exempted or modified from the competitive bid 
requirements of this section:

are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements of this section; however, a formal, written 
contract, approved by the city commission, shall be required for all such contracts in excess of 
$20,000.00, and any applicable state law, such as the Consultant's Competitive Negotiation Act 
shall be followed. 
(2) ?Noncompetitive supplies. Noncompetitive supplies, available only from one source, such as 
unique, patented or franchised supplies are exempt for the competitive requirements of this 
section. The city manager is authorized to purchase and contract for noncompetitive supplies up 
to $10,000.00, provided authorized funds are available in the annual budget. The city 
commission must approve purchases in excess of $10,000.00. 
(3) ?No bid received. Where no bid has been received after publication of a bid/proposal; however, 
such purchases in excess of $20,000.00 require a formal, written contract approved by the city 
commission. 
(4) ?Unique circumstances. Where the city commission finds unique circumstances to establish that 
competitive bidding is not in the best interest of the city; however, such purchases in excess of 
$20,000.00 shall require a formal, written contract approved by the city commission. The city 
commission, upon request by the city manager, may waive the requirement for a formal written 
contract when such a contract would not be in the best interest of the city. 
(5) ?Bids and contracts from other entities. The city manager is authorized to use competitive bids 
and formal contracts from other entities as provided in section 2-278.

open market procedure at the lowest obtainable price, any supplies or services not exceeding 
$25,000.00. A full report of the circumstances of all emergency purchases shall be filed with the city 
commission by the city manager at its next regular or special meeting. In the event an emergency 
requires the expenditure of more than $25,000.00, the city manager may approve the purchase and shall 
bring the expenditure to the city commission for ratification at the next regular, special or emergency 
meeting of the city commission.

exists in a building or structure, or upon a premises or property a condition that is contrary 
to or in violation of this building code which makes the building, structure, premises, or 
property, or any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems unsafe, dangerous or 
hazardous, the building official may enter the building, structure, premises or property at 
reasonable times to inspect or to perform any duties imposed by this building code. If such 
building, structure, premises or property are occupied, the building official shall present 
identification to the occupant and request entry. If such building, structure premises or 
property are unoccupied, the building official shall make a reasonable effort to locate the 
owner or other person having charge or control of the building, structure, premises or 
property and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to 
the remedies provided by law to secure entry.

warrant or other authorization provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or 
any persons having charge, care or control of any building, structure, or premises, or 
property shall fail or neglect, after request is made, to promptly permit entry by the building 
official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this building code.

or other construction related work is being done contrary to the provisions of this building 
code, or other laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this building 
code, or contrary to the condition of a permit, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the 
building official shall require the work stopped by posting a written notice in a conspicuous 
place on the site or served on any persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to 
be done. Such persons shall immediately cease and desist the identified work until 
authorized by the issuance of a new permit, issuance of a revised permit, or when 
authorized in writing by the building official to proceed with the work. Such notice shall be 
posted on the site or given either to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the 
person doing the work. Where an emergency exists, the building official may provide verbal 
notice and shall not be required to give written notice prior to stopping the work but shall 
provide such written notice within a reasonable time after stopping the work. Failure to 
cease work after receipt of either the verbal or written notice provided herein shall be a 
violation of this section. Stop work notices may be issued for all or a portion of the work 
performed on a site or pursuant to a permit. 
d. ?Rejection, suspension, revocation. The building official is authorized to reject a permit 
application and to suspend or revoke any approval or permit issued under the provisions of 
this building code whenever the application or approval was made or permit issued in error 
or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in violation of any 
ordinance or regulation, or any provision of this building code. 
e. ?Violation of code provisions. The building official is authorized to suspend or revoke a 
permit upon determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, 
demolition, installation, or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical 
or plumbing systems for which a permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity 
with, the provisions of this building code or the conditions of the permit. 
f. ?Unsafe buildings, structures, or systems. All buildings, structures or systems (electrical, 
gas, mechanical, plumbing) regulated by this building code that are structurally unsafe or 
not provided with adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise 
dangerous to human life are, for the purpose of this section, unsafe. Any use of buildings 
or structures or systems constituting a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason 
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster, damage or 
abandonment is, for the purpose of this section, an unsafe use. Parapet walls, cornices, 
spires, towers, tanks, statuary and other structural members that are supported by, 
attached to, or a part of a building or structure or systems and that are in deteriorated 
condition or otherwise unable to sustain the design loads that are specified in this building 
code are hereby designated as unsafe. 
All unsafe buildings, structures, or systems are hereby declared to be public nuisances and 
shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in chapter 2, administration, article III, code enforcement as amended. 
The building official may initiate any action to prevent, restrain, correct or abate the public 
nuisance.

requirements necessary for the strength, stability, safety or proper operation of an existing 
or proposed building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or for the

by this building code is being used in violation of the provisions of chapter 8 "Building 
Regulations and Fire Code", the building official may order such use discontinued and the 
structure, or portion thereof, vacated by serving written notice on any person causing such 
use (e.g. the owner, tenant, occupant or their agents) until such use complies with the 
requirements of this building code. Such person shall discontinue the use within the time 
prescribed by the building official after receipt of such notice. 
i. ?Modifications. When there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of 
this building code, the building official may grant modifications for individual cases. The 
building official shall first find that specific reasons make the strict letter of this building 
code impractical and that the modification is in conformance with the intent and purpose of 
this building code and that such modification does not lessen any fire-protection 
requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The details of any action granting 
modifications shall be in writing and recorded and entered in the files of the building official. 
The building official shall coordinate with the floodplain administrator to review requests 
submitted to the building official that seek approval to modify the strict application of the 
flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code to determine whether 
such requests require the granting of a variance pursuant to Section 117. 
j. ?Tests and surveys. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with any of the 
provisions of this building code or evidence that any material work or construction does not 
conform to the requirements of this building code or the approved plan or permit, the 
building official may require tests or surveys to be made at no cost to the city to insure 
compliance. Test methods shall be as specified by this building code or by other 
recognized test standards. If there are no recognized and accepted test methods, the

or detached, dwelling or accessory structures on such property for the occupancy or 
use of such owners and not offered for sale or lease (except for a two-family dwelling, 
one dwelling may be leased) and when acting as their own contractor and providing 
direct, onsite supervision themselves of all work not performed by licensed 
contractors, shall be exempt from the requirement that work be performed by a 
licensed contractor and the owner may obtain required permits except as provided 
above. 
2. ?Owners of property, constructing or improving buildings not included in subsection 
(b)(3)l.1., excluding electrical work, penetrations of fire related assemblies, installation 
of fire safety components, or work affecting the means of egress, on such property for

3. ?In an enforcement action brought under this part, proof of the sale or lease, or offering 
for sale or lease, of any such building by the owner within one-year after completion of 
the work or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever is later, creates a 
presumption that the construction was undertaken for purposes of sale or lease and 
shall be a violation of this section. This subsection does not exempt any person who is 
employed by or has a contract with such owner and who acts in the capacity of a 
contractor. 
The owner may not delegate the owner's responsibility to directly supervise all work to any 
other person unless that person is registered or certified under this part and the work being

5. ?To qualify for exemption under this subsection, a property owner must personally 
appear and sign the permit application. The building official may accept a notarized 
permit application if the property owner is unable to personally appear and sign the 
permit application. The building official shall provide the property owner with a 
disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
OWNER/BUILDER AFFIDAVIT  
Disclosure Statement 
State law requires construction to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a 
permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your 
property, to act as your own contractor with certain restrictions even though you do not 
have a license. 
As Owner/Builder you must provide direct, on-site supervision of the construction yourself. 
You may build or improve a one-family or two-family residential dwelling. You may also 
build or improve a commercial building, provided your costs do not exceed five hundred 
dollars ($500.00). The building or residential dwelling must be owned by you and for your 
own use or occupancy. The building or residential dwelling may not be built or substantially 
improved with the intent to sell or lease. If you sell or lease a building you have built or 
substantially improved yourself within one year after the construction is complete, the law 
will presume that you built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which is a violation 
of this exemption. 
As Owner/Builder, you must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction yourself. 
You may not hire an unlicensed person to act as your contractor or to supervise people 
working on your building. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you 
have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. You 
may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not 
licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on your building who is not 
licensed must work under your direct supervision and must be employed by you, which 
means that you must deduct F.I.C.A. and withholding tax and provide workers' 
compensation for that employee, all as prescribed by law. 
As Owner/Builder, your construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, 
building codes, and zoning regulations. You are responsible for acquiring all permits, 
approvals, plan submittal approvals and required inspections. You may be ordered to 
obtain an existing condition survey of the property and or a site plan locating the proposed 
work. 
m. ?Certificate of occupancy, exception. A certificate of occupancy shall not be required for: 
1. ?A change of ownership or tenancy in a building, for which a certificate of occupancy 
was issued, provided there has been no remodeling or alterations to the building to 
change its approved use. This exemption shall not apply to indoor or outdoor eating or 
drinking establishments (e.g., restaurants, bars, lounges) or to residential rental 
property which has not paid a local business tax for more than two years. 
2. ?Home occupations. This section shall not prohibit the building official or fire chief from 
conducting inspections that are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of 
the occupants and the general public. 
n. ?Violations and penalties. The city may pursue code enforcement actions against any 
person who violates any provision of this building code or fail to comply therewith or with 
any of the requirements thereof or any order of the building official, or who shall erect, 
construct, alter, demolish or move any structure, or has caused or allowed to be erected, 
constructed, altered, repaired, moved or demolished a building or structure in violation of 
this building code, as provided in chapter 2, administration, article III, code enforcement. 
The imposition of a fine does not prevent the revocation or suspension of a license, permit 
or franchise, or the imposition of civil fines or other administrative actions, including action 
pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, as amended. 
For violation(s) of the requirements of the flood provisions of the Florida Building Code, the 
building official may take action as cited within this Code and, if the violation is not resolved 
or corrected, such action may include submitting a request to the federal emergency 
management agency (FEMA) to remove the respective property's eligibility for flood 
insurance coverage through the national flood insurance program. 
o. ?Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a ruling of the building official or fire chief may file a 
written appeal to the county construction licensing — board of appeals ("board") or its 
successor as provided in Laws of Florida Chapter 75-489, as amended, provided such 
ruling is within the appellate jurisdiction of such board. 
(4) ?Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this building code is for 
any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the 
remaining portions of this building code. 
(d) ?[ Technical amendments—Florida Building Code, Building. ]

(d) ?Removal. Authority and procedures for city to remove accumulation of solid waste. 
(1) ?When items, which the city will collect for an additional charge (special pick-up waste) but for 
which collection has not been arranged, are discovered left in the right-of-way, the enforcement 
officer will leave a notification at the property of the need to arrange for collection of such items. 
If arrangements for collection have not been made within four calendar days, the city shall 
unilaterally remove the items and bill the property owner. 
(2) ?When items that the city does not collect are discovered left in the right-of-way, code 
enforcement officer will leave a notification at the property of the need to arrange for private 
collection of such items. If these items remain after four days, the enforcement division shall be 
notified for further action. 
(3) ?Billing for removal of accumulated items as specified in this section shall be in addition to 
penalties for violations of this chapter. 
    In the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this chapter and F.S. ch. 403 or 
implementing regulations, the provisions of F.S. ch. 403 or implementing regulations shall prevail if stricter 
and more stringent than this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 18-03 , § 3, 4-17-18) 


Secs. 38-6—38-10. - Reserved. 


ARTICLE II. - COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS AND WASTE 


Sec. 38-11. - Collection and disposal by city. 
(a) ?Residential and commercial waste collection. All waste generated and accumulated in the city shall, 
except as herein otherwise provided, be collected, transported and disposed of or otherwise 
managed by the city. Any residential or commercial property within the city that is being constructed, 
is occupied or is capable of being occupied, shall be presumed to be generating waste for collection. 
The city may fulfill its obligation through a contractor. 
(b) ?Single-family residential recyclable materials collection. All recyclable materials generated and 
accumulated by single-family dwellings within the city shall, except as herein otherwise provided, be 
collected, transported and processed or otherwise managed by the city. The city may fulfill its 
obligation through a contractor. 
(c) ?Multi-family residential recyclable materials collection. Beginning December 1, 2018 or other later 
date as established by resolution of the city commission, all recyclable materials generated and 
accumulated by multi-family dwellings within the city shall be collected, transported and processed or 
otherwise managed by the city. The city may fulfill its obligation through a contractor. If a multi-family 
customer has an existing recycling service provider as of the date of passage of this article, the 
customer shall contact the city to obtain a waiver of this requirement until such time as service can 
legally be provided by the city. 
(d) ?Commercial recyclable materials collection. The city reserves the right to collect or to contract for 
collection of recyclable materials accumulated by commercial establishments in competition with 
private recyclers. This right neither requires the commercial establishment to convey its recyclable 
materials to the city nor in way prevents a certified recovered materials dealer from entering into a 
contract with a commercial establishment to purchase, collect, transport, process or receive source-
separate recovered materials. 
(e) ?Recyclable materials. For a complete list of recyclable materials that the city collects at this time 
please see www.mytreasureisland.com. 
(f) ?Special pick-up waste. The city will collect special pick-up waste from residential customers for an 
additional charge as established by the city commission and provided by written resolution. The 
property owner, tenant or occupant has the option of contracting with a private collector to collect this 
special pick-up waste. 
(g) ?Drop-off facilities. The city may provide and maintain drop-off facilities as deemed appropriate for 
the collection of recyclable materials, storm debris or other materials as deemed necessary. 
(h) ?Exception for producers or owners. This chapter shall not prohibit the actual producers of waste or 
recyclable material or the owners of premises upon which waste or recyclable material has 
accumulated, from personally collecting, transporting and disposing of such waste or recyclable 
material provided such producers or owners comply with the provisions of this chapter and with all 
other governing laws and ordinances. This paragraph shall not be construed to provide for or as 
allowing collection by subcontract. An owner or producer of waste or recyclable material may sell or 
donate these materials but may not enter into any disposal agreement whereby the owner or 
producer pays for the use of the container or for hauling. Election to engage in other collection and 
disposal practices does not offset payment for or responsibilities of city-provided services. 
(i) ?Exception for permitted private collectors. The city manager may issue a permit to allow private 
collectors to provide waste collection services to commercial accounts upon a finding that the city's 
equipment is either inadequate to service the account or it is not economically feasible for the city to 
service the account. 
(1) ?The city shall have the unilateral right to approve the use of waste container sizes larger than 
those serviced by the city. 
(2) ?The city manager may, at any time, revoke any permit issued pursuant to this section upon 
finding that the city has acquired the equipment necessary to service the account or it has 
become economically feasible for the city to service such account. 
(3) ?The private collector that has been issued a permit shall compensate the city by paying the 
city, on a quarterly basis, a percentage of the gross revenue from the waste collection services 
provided in the city by such private collector. The percentage of the gross revenue shall be 15 
percent, which may be modified by resolution. Only private collectors in compliance with the

(1) ?The public rights-of-way within the city are a unique and physically limited resource and 
important amenity that are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the city. 
(2) ?The demand for telecommunications services has grown exponentially in recent years, 
requiring the continual upgrading of telecommunications equipment and services to satisfy such 
demand. 
(3) ?The placement of telecommunications equipment and facilities in the public rights-of-way to 
satisfy the demand for telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the 
city's responsibility to manage its public rights-of-way. 
(4) ?The public rights-of-way must be managed and controlled in a manner that enhances the 
health, safety and general welfare of the city and its citizens. 
(5) ?The use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way by providers of communications services 
must be subject to regulation which can ensure minimal inconvenience to the public, coordinate 
users, maximize available space, reduce maintenance and costs to the public, and facilitate 
entry of an optimal number of providers of cable, telecommunications, and other services in the 
public interest. 
(6) ?F.S. § 166.041 provides for procedures for adoption of an ordinance which is a regulation of 
general and permanent nature and enforceable as local law. 
(7) ?F.S. § 337.401 addresses the authority of municipalities to regulate the placement and 
maintenance of communication facilities, and other utilities, in the public rights-of-way. 
(8) ?In 2017, Florida passed Chapter 2017-136, Laws of Florida, which inter alia, amends F.S. § 
337.401, to create the new Subsection (7) known as the Advanced Wireless Infrastructure 
Deployment Act ("Wireless Deployment Act"), effective July 1, 2017, to address municipalities' 
regulation of access to the public rights-of-way for wireless communications facilities and 
wireless support structures. 
(9) ?The Wireless Deployment Act provides that municipalities may require a registration process in 
accordance with F.S. § 337.401(3), may adopt by ordinance provisions for insurance coverage, 
indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality 
liability or municipal warranties. 
(10) ?The communication industry is in a constant state of emerging technology that includes the 
infrastructure required to support the increased demand and capacity to receive and to transmit 
increased data and voice communications. 
(11) ?The city has received requests to place wireless communications facilities and wireless 
support structures within the public rights-of-way. 
(12) ?The current Code does not contain requirements for registration, insurance, permitting, 
insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, abandonment, municipality liability or 
municipal warranties that address sufficiently the placement or maintenance within the public 
rights-of-way for wireline and wireless communications facilities or wireless support structures. 
(13) ?The city finds that, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, it is necessary to: 
a. ?Provide for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-
of-way within the city limits. 
b. ?Adopt and administer reasonable rules, regulations and general conditions not inconsistent 
with applicable state and federal law. 
c. ?Manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-
way by all communications services providers. 
d. ?Minimize disruption to the public rights-of-way; and 
e. ?Require the restoration of the public rights-of-way to original condition. 
(14) ?It is the intent of the city to require that the placement or maintenance of any wireline or 
wireless communications facility or wireless support structure in the public rights-of-way must 
have an effective registration which satisfies the requirements set forth herein for such 
registration, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 
(15) ?It is also the city's intent to exercise the city's retained authority to regulate and manage the 
city's roads and rights-of-way in exercising its police power over communications services 
providers' placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way in a 
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner. 
(b) ?This article applies to any public or private entity who seeks to construct, place, install, maintain or 
operate a communications services or facilities, as such terms are defined herein, in the public 
rights-of-way, unless otherwise exempt by operation of applicable state or federal law. This article 
equally applies to a city owned or controlled communications services except to the extent such 
facilities are utilized on an internal, non-commercial basis by the city or any of its agencies, 
departments or bureaus. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-67. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, have the meanings ascribed to 
them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abandonment means the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility for a period of 
90 or more consecutive days; provided that this term does not include cessation of all use of a 
communications facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By 
way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit 
continues to be used, will not be considered abandonment while the cessation of use of a small wireless 
facility collocated upon an active utility pole will be considered abandonment of the small wireless facility 
but not constitute abandonment of the active utility pole. Removal of all utilities, including small wireless 
facilities, from a pole and leaving the pole, in whole or in part, will constitute abandonment of the utility 
pole. 
    Antenna means communication equipment that transmits or receives electro-magnetic radio 
frequency signals used in providing wireless services. 
    Applicable codes means uniform building, fire, electrical, plumbing, or mechanical codes adopted by 
a recognized national code organization or local amendments to those codes enacted solely to address 
threats of destruction of property or injury to persons, or local codes or ordinances adopted to implement 
this subsection. The term includes objective design standards adopted by ordinance that may require a 
new utility pole that replaces an existing utility pole to be of substantially similar design, material, and 
color or that may require reasonable spacing requirements concerning the location of ground-mounted 
equipment. The term includes objective design standards adopted by ordinance that may require a small 
wireless facility to meet reasonable location, context, color, stealth, and concealment requirements; 
however, such design standards may be waived by the city upon a showing that the design standards are 
not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that the design 
standards impose an excessive expense. 
    Applicant, owner, or permittee means any person requesting permission to place or maintain 
facilities in a right-of-way, or who has previously done so. 
    As-built survey means the final complete drawing(s) in hard copy signed and sealed by a 
professional surveyor and mapper, as defined in F.S. § 472.005. Additionally, the as-built survey must be 
delivered to the city in an electronic format suitable to the city to update the GIS system. An as-built 
survey is a survey performed to obtain horizontal and vertical dimensional data so that constructed 
improvements may be located and delineated. As-built surveys depict the present/existing state of 
facilities/improvements in/on/through right(s)-of way and/or land. 
    Co-location, co-locate or attach means to install, mount, maintain, modify, operate, or replace one or 
more wireless facilities on, under, within, or adjacent to a wireless support structure or utility pole. The 
term does not include the installation of a new utility pole or wireless support structure in the public rights-
of-way. Co-location upon an existing structure not providing telecommunication services does not convert 
the structure into a wireless facility. 
    Communications services have the meaning found in F.S. § 202.11, as may be amended, which 
includes the transmission, conveyance, or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or 
signals, including video services, to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, 
radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter 
devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. The term includes such 
transmission, conveyance, or routing in which computer processing applications are used to act on the 
form, code, or protocol of the content for purposes of transmission, conveyance, or routing without regard 
to whether such service is referred to as voice-over-Internet-protocol services or is classified by the 
Federal Communications Commission as enhanced or value-added. The term does not include: 
(1) ?Information services. 
(2) ?Installation or maintenance of wiring or equipment on a customer's premises. 
(3) ?The sale or rental of tangible personal property. 
(4) ?The sale of advertising, including, but not limited to, directory advertising. 
(5) ?Bad check charges. 
(6) ?Late payment charges. 
(7) ?Billing and collection services. 
(8) ?Internet access service, electronic mail service, electronic bulletin board service, or similar 
online computer services. 
    Emergency means a condition that poses a threat to life, health, or property, or may create an out-of-
service condition. 
    Facility means the plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to, any and all such 
conduits, cables, poles, wires, supports, ducts, fiber, optics, antenna and other structures, equipment, 
appurtenances and pathways, including wireless facilities, small wireless facilities and micro-wireless 
facilities, as may be reasonably necessary to be used to provide communications services. Multiple 
cables, conduits, strands, or fibers located within the same conduit will be considered one 
communications facility for purposes of this subsection. 
    Micro wireless facility means a small wireless facility having dimensions no larger than 24 inches in 
length, 15 inches in width, and 12 inches in height and an exterior antenna, if any, no longer than 11 
inches.

or maintain any facility in a right-of-way. 
    Permittee means any person to whom a permit to place or maintain a facility in a right-of-way has 
been granted by the city. 
    Person means any natural or corporate person, municipality, school, church, or business entity 
including, but not limited to, a partnership, a sole proprietorship, a political subdivision, a public or private 
agency of any kind, a communications service or facility, a successor or assign of any of the foregoing, or 
any other legal entity which has or seeks to have facilities located in any right-of-way. 
    Place or maintain, placement and maintenance, or placing or maintaining means to erect, construct, 
install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A person that owns or 
exercises physical control over facilities located in the rights-of-way, such as physical control to maintain 
and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or the 
use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the facilities through 
which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the 
airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities within the public 
rights-of-way. 
    Provider means any person that places and/or maintains or seeks to place and/or maintain 
communications facilities. 
    Registrant means a provider who has a valid registration with the city.

cubic feet in volume or in the case of antennas that have exposed elements, each antenna and 
all of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet in 
volume; and 
(2) ?All other wireless equipment associated with the facility is cumulatively no more than 28 cubic 
feet in volume. The following types of associated ancillary equipment are not included in the 
calculation of equipment volume; electric meters, concealment elements, telecommunications 
demarcation boxes, ground-based enclosures, grounding equipment, power transfer switches, 
cutoff switches, vertical cable runs for the connection of power and other services, and utility 
poles or other support structures. 
    Telecommunications means the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of 
information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and 
received. 
    Utilities means any water, sewer, gas, drainage, monitoring well, sprinkler or culvert pipe and any 
electric power, telecommunication, signal, communication, or cable television conduit, fiber, wire, cable,

equipment is collocated; 
(2) ?Wireline backhaul facilities; or 
(3) ?Coaxial or fiber-optic cable that is between wireless structures or utility poles or that is 
otherwise not immediately adjacent to or directly associated with a particular antenna. 
    Wireless infrastructure provider means a person who has been certificated to provide 
telecommunications service in the state and who builds or installs wireless communication transmission 
equipment, wireless facilities, or wireless support structures, but is not a wireless services provider. 
    Wireless provider means a wireless infrastructure provider or a wireless services provider. 
    Wireless service provider means a person who provides wireless services. 
    Wireless services means any services provided using licensed or unlicensed spectrum, whether at a

(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-74. - Abandoned facilities. 
(a) ?A person who abandons a facility in the public right-of-way shall notify the city manager within 90 
days. 
(b) ?The city may direct the provider by written notice to remove all or any portion of such abandoned 
facility, where feasible, at the provider's sole expense if the city determines that the abandoned 
facility's presence interferes with the public health, safety or welfare, which includes, but is not be 
limited to, a determination that such facility may: 
(1) ?Compromise safety for any right-of-way user; 
(2) ?Prevent another provider from placing or maintaining facilities; or 
(3) ?Create a maintenance condition disruptive to use of right-of-way. 
(c) ?In the event that the city manager does not direct the removal of the abandoned facility, the 
provider, by its notice of abandonment, consents to the alteration, use, or removal of all or any 
portion of the facility by another provider or the city. 
(d) ?If the provider fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned facility as directed by the city 
manager within a reasonable time-period, the city may perform such removal and charge all costs of 
the removal against the provider. 
(e) ?The city may independently establish that a communications facility has been abandoned. In 
reaching such determination, the city may request documentation and/or affidavits from the provider 
regarding the active use of the facility. If the provider fails to provide the requested documentation 
within 30 days, a rebuttable presumption exists that the provider has abandoned the communications 
facility. If the city manager determines that a facility was abandoned, it may take any of the steps 
listed above. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-75. - Construction and restoration. 
(a) ?City projects. For work done in advance of or as part of a city project, it is required that prior to the 
placement or maintenance of facilities in the right-of-way, a provider shall conduct a subsurface utility 
engineering (SUE) study on the proposed route of construction or expansion, all at provider's 
expense. A SUE study consists of, at minimum, completion of the following tasks: 
(1) ?Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location data indicating the existence and 
approximate location of all underground facilities along the proposed construction route. 
(2) ?Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any above-ground features of all 
underground facilities along the proposed construction route, including but not limited to 
manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs. 
(3) ?Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the tasks described above on the 
provider's proposed system route maps, plan sheets and computer aided drafting and design 
(CADD) files, or in such other electronic format as maintained by the provider which is 
acceptable to the city manager. 
(4) ?Determine and record the presence and approximate horizontal location of all underground 
facilities in the right-of-way along the proposed system route utilizing surface geophysical 
designating techniques such as electromagnetic, magnetic and elastic wave locating methods. 
(5) ?Where system design and the location of underground facilities appear to conflict on the 
updated system route maps, plans and CADD (or acceptable alternate) files, utilize non-
destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified to 
determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial position, composition, 
size and other specifications of the conflicting underground facilities. A provider shall not 
excavate more than a 200 millimeter by 200 millimeter (eight inches by eight inches) hole in the 
right-of-way to complete this task. 
(6) ?Plot, incorporate and reconcile the data obtained by completion of these tasks with the updated 
route maps, system plans and CADD (or acceptable alternate) files. 
(7) ?Based on all of the data collected upon completion of these tasks, adjust the proposed system 
design elevations, horizontal and vertical locations to avoid the need to relocate other 
underground facilities. 
(8) ?Copy to city. Upon completion of the SUE, the provider shall record all of the data collected into 
a CADD file, or acceptable alternate, compatible with that used by the city and deliver a copy to 
the city manager. 
(9) ?Qualified firm. All subsurface utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to this section must 
be performed by a firm specializing in SUE work that is approved by the city manager, or may 
be performed by the provider's agents or employees, if qualified. 
(b) ?Provider projects. 
(1) ?Coordination of work. Upon request of the city, provider may be required to coordinate 
placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, 
installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable 
timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and provider may be required to reasonably alter 
its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and 
disturbances in the public rights-of-way. Within the public rights-of-way, every provider shall 
make space available in its trench and/or conduit to other providers consistent with the federal 
requirements of 47 U.S.C. 224. Every provider shall utilize existing conduits, pathways and 
other facilities whenever possible, and shall not place or maintain any new, different, or 
additional poles, conduits, pathways or other facilities, whether in the public rights-of-way or on 
privately-owned property, until written approval is obtained from the city or other appropriate 
governmental authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner. 
(2) ?Protection of facilities. A provider shall not place or maintain its facilities so as to interfere with, 
displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water 
mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully 
occupying the rights-of-way. 
(3) ?Least disruptive technology. All construction or maintenance of facilities must be accomplished 
in the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the right-of-way, subject 
to economic and technical feasibility. 
(4) ?As-built. Upon completion of each permitted construction activity, the provider shall provide the 
city with accurate "as-built" drawings of the facilities as installed, in accordance with section 42-
76 of this Code. 
(5) ?Right-of-way restoration. A provider shall, at its own cost and without delay, restore 
(replace/repair) the public right-of-way to its original condition, in compliance with the minimum 
city technical standards, after completion of placement or maintenance of its facility(ies) therein. 
If the provider fails to commence such restoration within 30 days following the completion of 
such placement and/or maintenance and complete such work within 90 days, the city may 
perform such restoration and charge the costs of the restoration to the provider in accordance 
with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended. The provider shall, to the satisfaction of the city, 
maintain and correct any restorations made pursuant hereto, for a period of 18 months following 
the date of its completion. Upon written notice from the city regarding any failure to comply with 
this subsection, failure to remedy within 30 days of such notice will be sufficient grounds for 
denial of any future rights-of-way permits for the placement and/or maintenance of 
communications facilities. 
(6) ?The provider is responsible for any damage resulting from placement or maintenance of its 
facilities. This responsibility covers not only city property, but facilities lawfully placed or 
maintained by other providers, and includes damage caused by service interruptions or failure 
of the provider's facilities to function properly. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-76. - Provision and filing of as-built surveys. 
    Within 60 days after completion of any placement of a communications facility in the public rights-of-
way, the provider shall submit the as-built survey(s), at its expense, showing the final location of such 
facility in the public rights-of-way, to the city. For maintenance of a communications facility which alters 
the configuration and/or location of such facility as depicted/described in the as-built survey on file with 
the city, then a new as-built survey must be filed. Such survey(s) will be filed with the city and included as 
part of the right-of-way permit record that was issued for the work performed. Failure of the provider to 
submit the required as-built survey(s) in a timely manner may cause the subject permit to be revoked and 
is sufficient grounds for the city to deny the issuance of any future right-of-way permits to the provider. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-77. - Enforcement of permit obligations. 
(a) ?Work done without a permit. 
(1) ?Emergency situations. 
a. ?Each provider shall immediately notify the city manager via telephone or e-mail of any 
event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may 
proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. The 
provider may be required to obtain an "after-the-fact" permit within a ten business days 
following the emergency work or submit revised as-built drawings, where excavation is 
required. 
b. ?In the event that city, becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's facilities, the 
city shall attempt to contact the local representative of each provider or person affected, or 
potentially affected by the emergency. In any event, the city manager may take whatever 
reasonable action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the provider 
whose facilities occasioned the emergency will bear the cost such reasonable actions. 
c. ?Except for acts of willful misconduct or gross negligence and to the extent permitted by 
applicable law, neither the city nor its officials, consultants, agents, or employees have any 
liability to the provider for any claims, damages, costs, expenses, or losses resulting from 
the city's breakage, removal, alteration, or relocation of any facility which arose out of or in 
connection with any emergency situation or, in the sole discretion of the city manager, 
deemed necessary to facilitate any public works project, public improvement, alteration of a 
city structure, change in the grade or line of any public right-of-way, or the elevation of any 
public right-of-way, or was found by the city commission to be in the best interest of the 
health, safety or general welfare of the public. 
(2) ?Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any person who obstructs or 
excavates a right-of-way without a permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay five times the 
normal fee for said permit, pay five times all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with 
the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all of the 
requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-78. - Inspections, enforcement, stop work orders, and revocation of permit. 
(a) ?Inspection/stop work orders. 
(1) ?Within one week prior to the time the work under any permit hereunder is to commence, the 
provider shall notify the city manager to ensure a mutual agreement as to the work to be done. 
(2) ?Within one week of the time the work under any site specific permit hereunder is completed, 
the provider shall notify the city manager. 
(3) ?The provider shall make the work site available to the city's inspector and to all others 
authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon 
completion of the work. 
(4) ?The city's inspector may issue an order to the provider for correction of any work that does not 
conform to the applicable standards, permit conditions or codes. Failure to correct the violation 
may result in the issuance of a red tag or be cause for revocation of the permit. 
(5) ?Work on any facility within the right-of-way that is being done contrary to the provisions of this 
article, or the terms and conditions of the permit, may be immediately stopped upon the 
following conditions: 
a. ?In an emergency situation that may have a serious effect on health or safety; 
b. ?When irreversible or irreparable harm may result, in the reasonable opinion of the city 
manager, and immediate cessation of the activity is necessary to protect the public and the 
right-of-way. The city shall provide written notice to the provider or the person performing 
the work, and the notice must state the conditions under which work may be resumed. 
Verbal notice will be sufficient in emergencies and written notice will follow. Written notice 
must be by hand delivery, electronic or standard mail, and may be posted at the job site, 
and given to the person performing the work and/or provider. Upon issuance of a stop work 
order, the cited work must immediately cease. The stop work order must state the reason 
for the order, and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume. 
Where an emergency exists, verbal notice by the city manager will be sufficient to require 
the stoppage of work; or 
c. ?Any person who actively continues any work after having been served with a stop work 
order, except such work as that person is directed by the city to perform, to remove a 
violation or unsafe condition, will be subject to penalties as provided in section 1-15. The 
city retains all available legal remedies to abate the work. 
(6) ?The inspection or permitting by the city of work under this article shall not be construed as a 
warranty of the adequacy of performance or of the accuracy of information provided in the 
permit application by the provider. The provider retains full responsibility for information 
provided and the provider retains full responsibility for work performed at all times. 
(b) ?Reserved. 
(c) ?Revocation of permits. 
(1) ?Permittee held permits issued pursuant to the Code is a privilege and not a right. The holder of 
a permit does not possess a vested right to maintain its facilities in a particular location, nor may 
the rights of the provider be construed to be an interest in real property of a property right 
subject to constitutional protection. 
(2) ?The city reserves the right, as provided herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any 
fees, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, 
rule or regulations, or any condition of the permit. A substantial breach by provider includes, but

(3) ?Except in an emergency which could endanger health or safety, the city manager, shall issue a 
written notice to the provider of the breach, which must include the corrective actions to be 
taken by the provider and the time allowed for corrective action. In an emergency, no notice is 
required, and the city may take all such steps it deems necessary to safeguard the public. 
(4) ?In addition, the city can pursue all other lawful actions, including the filing of a complaint with 
the public service commission, the filing in any appropriate court for an injunction seeking 
enforcement of the terms of this article or the permit or to enjoin any use of the right-of-way.

Sec. 42-82. - Design standards. 
(a) ?Purpose and intent. Above ground and underground facilities, communications facilities, utility 
poles, and associated facilities and equipment must be designed in such a manner to ensure such 
facilities and poles are placed in locations that do not interfere with the safe operation of traffic 
control equipment and movement of the traveling public. These facilities and poles must be designed 
to maximize compatibility with the affected area (a 500-foot radius of the proposed location) and to 
minimize any negative visual impact on that area. Pursuant to F.S. § 337.401(7), the following design 
standards must apply, unless waived pursuant to section 42-83. 
(b) ?General placement requirements within public rights-of-way. 
(1) ?Above ground facilities, communications facilities, utility poles, and associated ground mounted 
facilities and equipment. Such facilities and equipment must not create any safety hazard(s) or 
physical or visual obstruction to vehicular, bicycle, and/or pedestrian traffic. 
(2) ?Communications facilities placement within public rights-of-way. Communications facilities 
must be placed between the property line and the curb line of all streets and must not be within 
the roadway recovery area. Underground cables, where required, must have consistent 
alignment parallel with the edge of pavement, a 36-inch depth of cover for the paved portion of 
roadways, a 24-inch to 30-inch depth of cover in all areas except the paved portion of 
roadways, and must have a two-foot horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and 
their appurtenances. 
(3) ?Grounding rods and pull boxes. The grounding rod may not extend above the top of sidewalk 
and must be placed in a pull box, and the ground wire between the pole and ground rod must 
be inside an underground conduit. All pull boxes must be vehicle load bearing, comply with 
FDOT Standard Specification 635 and be listed on the FDOT Approved Products List. A 
concrete pad must be installed around all pull boxes not located in the sidewalk. No new or 
replacement pull boxes must be located in pedestrian ramps. 
(4) ?Signs. No signs may be permitted on or attached to communications facilities or utility poles in 
public rights-of-way, unless otherwise required by federal or state law. Any existing facility or 
structure that lawfully supports signs may continue to support such signs, as otherwise 
permitted by city code or state or federal law, as may be amended. 
(5) ?Other associated ground mounted facilities and equipment. Ground-mounted equipment for 
small wireless facilities must be located within a ten feet radius of the utility pole supporting 
such facility and, if possible, in areas with existing foliage or other aesthetic features to obscure 
the view of the ground-mounted equipment. The ground-mounted equipment must use wrap or 
painted that is similar to the pole color. If the city has a planned future project to replace 
facilities or equipment in the subject public rights-of-way, the replacement facilities or equipment 
proposed in the application or SWFC application must conform to the city's updated design, 
material, and color. 
(6) ?Separation from driveways and hydrants. Communications facilities and utility poles must be 
located at least three feet from a driveway apron and at least four feet from a fire hydrant. 
(7) ?New and replacement utility poles; general, city-wide placement and maintenance standards. 
a. ?New utility poles, where permitted, must be placed between the property line and the curb 
line of all streets and may not be within the roadway recovery area. The lowest wire on any 
of such poles, placed in any public rights-of-way open to vehicular, bicycle, and/or 
pedestrian traffic may not be less than 18 feet from the ground and, whenever telephone 
and electric power wires cross each other, wires must cross and be maintained in 
accordance with the National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Safety Code and the 
"Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication 
Lines" established by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Standards of the United 
States, as may be amended; 
b. ?New utility poles, where permitted, must be made of the similar design, material, and color 
as other utility poles within the same public right-of-way (within 500 feet in any direction 
along that right-of-way). Where no utility poles exist within the aforementioned right-of-way, 
black enamel/paint-clad metal or concrete poles are required, and such poles are generally 
preferred throughout the city, as applicable; 
c. ?New poles, where permitted, must adhere to the protection and pruning standards, as set 
forth in chapter 72, located in the public rights-of-way and/or on private property. A provider 
shall not prune, remove, or irreversibly damage any protected tree, as defined in chapter 
72 of this Code, unless such activity is authorized by a permit issued by the city; and 
d. ?Replacement utility poles must be of similar design, material, and color of the existing pole 
being replaced; however, black enamel/paint-clad metal or concrete poles, are preferred. 
The replacement pole must be located in approximately the same location as the existing 
pole. The replacement pole must continue to serve its primary function. If the city has a 
planned future project to replace utility poles in the subject public rights-of-way, the 
replacement poles proposed in the application or small wireless facilities colocation 
application must conform to the city's updated design, material, and color. 
e. ?At-grade facilities, aerial wireline facilities and utility poles in the right-of-way shall comply 
with undergrounding requirements of the city that prohibit above ground structures in the 
right-of-way, as applicable. 
f. ?Guidance for location. The city strongly encourages: 
1. ?Utility poles should be placed equal distance between existing utility poles, if any, 
within the right-of-way; and 
2. ?For placement within residentially-zoned districts. At grade facilities and utility poles 
should be placed either at the common property line of the parcels that abut the right-
of-way or another location that demonstrates the least impact to access such parcels. 
At grade facilities and utility poles should be placed such that the view from principal 
structures within the residential districts are not significantly impaired. 
3. ?Non-residentially zoned districts. At grade and utility poles should be placed either at 
the common property line of the parcels that abut the right-of-way or another location 
that demonstrates the least impact to access such parcels. 
(c) ?General stealth design requirements within public rights-of-way, city-wide. 
(1) ?The small wireless facility, electric meters and disconnect switches may be mounted on the 
exterior of the pole and must be concealed with use of shrouds that are similar to the pole color 
and texture; 
(2) ?No exposed wires, cables, conduits, etc., attached to poles; preferred if such are placed 
internal to pole, but if not possible, then such attachments must be concealed with use of 
shrouds that are similar to the pole color and texture; and 
(3) ?Other components, such as back-haul, where housed above-ground, must be placed within a 
cabinet, box, or other such container that are concealed with durable materials or paint that are 
similar to the pole color or includes other imagery in context with the location of equipment (i.e., 
imagery of vegetation, architectural/geometrical patterns, or equivalent). 
(4) ?Unless otherwise provided by state or federal laws or regulations, a small wireless facility is 
prohibited from having any type of light, lighted signal, or illuminations. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-83. - Waiver of objective design standards for small wireless facilities. 
(a) ?Objective design standards provided in section 42-82 may be waived by the city manager, upon the 
wireless services provider demonstrating to the city, that the objective design standards are not 
reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that the objective 
design standards impose an excessive expense. The objective design standards may also be 
waived to comply with 47 U.S.C. 332 pertaining to gap in coverage. 
(b) ?A request for a waiver must be filed contemporaneously with the small wireless facility collocation 
application. The request for waiver must contain each section or subsection for which a waiver is 
being sought. A request for a waiver must include a detailed explanation, with supporting 
engineering or other data, as to why a waiver from the requirements of this article is required. For 
waivers based on 47 U.S.C. 332, the request for waiver must demonstrate that denial of the small 
wireless facilities colocation application will result in a significant gap in a wireless service provider's 
coverage, and that the proposed facility is the least intrusive means for closing that gap within said 
wireless service provider's network. 
(c) ?In granting any waiver, the city may impose conditions to the extent the city concludes such 
conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed small wireless facility 
within a 500 feet radius of the proposed location, or to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the 
public. 
(d) ?The city shall grant or deny a request for a waiver within 45 days after receiving such request. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-84. - Appeals. 
    Any person adversely affected by a decision of the city manager in the permitting, enforcement or 
interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this article may appeal that decision to the city 
commission. Such appeal must be taken by filing written notice with the city manager, with a copy to the 
city clerk, within 20 days after the decision of the city manager. Each appeal must be accompanied by a 
payment in sufficient amount to cover the cost of publishing and mailing notices of hearings. Failure to file 
such appeal constitutes acceptance of the permit and any conditions thereof or the denial of the 
application. Where a notice of appeal to the city manager is not timely filed as provided in this section, 
such right to appeal is waived. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-85. - Insurance. 
(a) ?A provider shall provide, pay for, and maintain with companies satisfactory to the city, the types of 
insurance described in this section. All insurance must be from responsible companies duly 
authorized to do business in the state and having a financial rating in Best's Insurance Guide of B+ 
Class VI A-Class VII or better. All liability policies must provide that the city is an additional insured 
as to such provider's operations in the public rights-of-way and must provide the severability of 
interest provision. The required coverages must be evidenced by properly executed certificates of 
insurance on forms furnished by the official. Certified copies of the policies required by this section 
are acceptable in lieu of such certificates of insurance and must be furnished at the time of 
application to the official within five days of the city's request therefor. Renewal certificates must be 
provided to the city at least ten days prior to the expiration of the current coverages. The certificates 
must be manually signed by the authorized representative of the insurance company. Thirty days 
advanced written notice by registered or certified mail must be given to the city of any cancellation, 
intent not to renew or reduction in the policy coverages. Provider shall also notify risk management 
within 24 hours after the receipt of any notices of expiration, cancellation, non-renewal or material 
change in coverage, received by the provider from its insurer and immediately send a copy of that 
notice to risk management. Companies issuing the insurance policies must have no recourse against 
the city for payment or premiums or assessments or for any deductibles which are the sole 
responsibility and risk of the provider. The policy clause "other insurance" will not apply to any 
insurance coverage currently held by the city, to any such future coverage, or to the city's self-
insured retentions of whatever nature. 
(b) ?The limits and types of coverage of insurance required will not be less than the following: 
(1) ?Commercial general liability insurance. Commercial general liability insurance must be written 
on ISO Occurrence Form CG 00 01 or an equivalent substitute form to cover liability arising 
from premises and operations, independent contractors, products and completed operations, 
personal and advertising injury, blanket contractual, and XCU exposures, unless waived by the 
city. Completed operations liability coverage must be maintained for a minimum of one year 
following the cessation of the placement of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
The combined bodily injury and property damage limit must not be less than $5,000,000.00 
each occurrence and annual aggregate and must apply specifically to the provider's activities in 
the public rights-of-way. 
(2) ?Automobile liability insurance. Automobile liability insurance must be maintained in accordance 
with the laws of the state as to the ownership, maintenance and use of all owned, non-owned,

$500,000.00 disease aggregate and $500,000.00 each accident. 
(c) ?Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider may provide such coverage through an actuarially sound 
and prudent self-insurance program that is satisfactory to the city. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-86. - Performance bond. 
(a) ?Prior to issuance of any permit in accordance with this article, the registrant shall be required to 
obtain, pay for, and file with the city, a performance bond. The performance bond must serve to 
guarantee proper performance under the requirements of this article and the permit, the timeliness 
and quality of the construction and restoration of the affected public rights-of-way, and to secure, and 
enable the city to recover all costs related to the restoration of the rights-of-way, in the event the 
registrant fails to make such restoration to the city's satisfaction or causes damage to the rights-of-
way during construction. The performance bond must name the city as obligee, and be conditioned 
upon the full and faithful compliance by the registrant, with all requirements, duties, and obligations 
imposed by the permit and provisions of this article, during and through completion of the proposed 
placement and/or maintenance activity(ies). The performance bond must be in a form acceptable to 
the city attorney and must be issued by a surety having an A.M. Best A-Class VII rating or better and 
duly authorized to conduct business in the State of Florida. 
(b) ?The performance bond must be in the face amount of the estimated costs of the restoration of the 
rights-of-way, but in no event less than $2,500.00. For a consolidated small wireless facilities 
colocation application, when allowed under this chapter, the registrant shall provide a performance 
bond in the amount of the total costs of the restoration of the rights-of-way for all wireless 
communication facilities requested to be collocated on an existing structure within the rights-of-way,

(c) ?The performance bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a term of not less than 90 days 
after the anticipated date of completion of construction, restoration, and city inspection. In the event 
the term of any construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to 90 days after 
the completion of construction, restoration, and city inspection, the registrant shall immediately 
obtain, pay for, and file with the city, a replacement performance bond. 
(d) ?The city's right to recover under the performance bond must be in addition to all other rights of the 
city, whether reserved in this article, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding, or 
exercise of a right, with respect to the performance bond, will affect or preclude any other right the 
city may have. Any proceeds recovered under the performance bond may be used to reimburse the 
city for such additional expenses, as may be incurred by the city, as a result of the failure of the 
registrant to comply with the responsibilities imposed by this article, including, but not limited to, 
attorney's fees and costs of any action or proceeding. 
(Ord. No. 18-06 , § 2, 7-24-18) 


Sec. 42-87. - Indemnification. 
(a) ?By reason of the acceptance of a registration or a permit under this article, the city does not assume

the registrant or the city; or for claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, 
placement, maintenance, and/or operation of communication facilities by registrants or activities of 
registrants. 
(b) ?To the fullest extent permitted by state law, a registrant shall defend, indemnify, and hold the city 
whole (including the members of its commission, boards, its officers, officials, agents and 
employees) and harmless from all costs, liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of 
the construction, presence, placement, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its 
communications facilities, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or 
prohibited by a permit, inspection of plans or work by the city, except to the extent that such claims 
are caused by the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the city. This section is not, as to third 
parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the registrant or to the city; and 
the registrant, in defending any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action 
every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. The provisions of this section

time be billed by the city. 
    Delinquent account: Any account upon which the balance in full has not been paid by the due date of 
the billing. 
    Deposit: The amount of a deposit for a residential single-family home shall be $150.00. The amount 
of a deposit for all accounts other than residential single-family dwellings shall be an amount that is 
calculated on the average of the last six billing cycles (12 months) multiplied by 1.5 and rounded to the 
nearest ten-dollar increment, with a minimum deposit of $150.00. 
    Exempt account: Any account that is deemed pursuant to the provisions of this section to be exempt 
from the requirements of maintaining a utility deposit. 
    Non-owner: Those customers, both residential and commercial, who rent or occupy or use any 
property, whether as a residence or a business that is owned by any person, firm or entity other than the 
customer. 
    Shut-off eligible account: Any account which for reason of nonpayment, receives a letter specifically 
advising the account of the date of the shut-off. 
(b) ?Deposit required. Unless otherwise exempt by the provisions of this section, a deposit shall be 
required on all new or delinquent utility accounts within the city. The amount of such deposit shall be 
determined as set forth in the above definition of deposit. 
(c) ?Exempt accounts. All accounts in existence in the city as of the effective date of this section shall 
initially be deemed to be exempt accounts, unless they shall become delinquent, as defined herein, 
in which case a deposit will be required. Accounts for all residential, single-family customers that are 
billed to the owner, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section requiring a deposit, unless 
such account has become a shut-off eligible account, as defined herein, in which case a deposit will 
be required. All other accounts for which a deposit has been held for 12 billing cycles (24 months) 
and for which all payments have been received by the initial due date of each cycle, shall be deemed 
to be exempt, and any deposit held for such account shall be refunded upon receipt of the 
customer's written request for refund of such deposit. For all accounts, the city may require a deposit 
if a check, intended as payment, is returned by the bank. Factors to be considered include the 
reason for the return and the payment history on the account. 
(d) ?Interest on deposits. The city will pay interest on all amounts held on deposit. Such interest will be 
applied to each account during the August billing cycle. The amount of interest paid by the city shall 
be determined based upon the city's average rate of return on its short-term investments during the 
one-year period preceding the calculation of the interest payments, less 50 basis points. Deposits 
held less than one year will receive interest prorated to the nearest month. Accounts closed and/or

customer of the customer's entitlement to a refund. If the customer is not entitled to a refund, the 
customer will be advised and will be advised at the earliest date at which the customer would be 
entitled to a refund, assuming that all future payments are remitted by the initial due date. If a 
request for refund is approved, any outstanding amounts due will be deducted from the deposit and 
accrued interest, and the balance will be refunded by check within 15 business days. 
(f) ?Closed accounts. Upon an account being closed and the customer submitting written request to the 
city, any deposit will be refunded. The city will calculate the final bill and prorated interest, if any, and 
apply the deposit and interest, if any, toward the final bill. If there is a balance due the customer, the 
city will mail a refund check to the customer's forwarding address within 15 business days. If there is 
a balance due the city, the customer will be required to pay such balance immediately, or upon the 
customer's request, the city will issue a courtesy invoice, payable within five business days.

units, regardless of whether or not such are served by a single water or sewer connection. 
    Equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) means a unit of measure that provides a basis for comparing the 
stormwater runoff generated by one property to that generated by another. An EDU is defined as the 
average of the impervious area for an equivalent dwelling unit to house a single family. EDU is based on 
single-family units, duplexes, multifamily units, hotels and motels. This average has been calculated by 
using a statistical sample to be 1,513 square feet in the city. 
    Impervious area means area of the impervious surface in a parcel of real property that prevents or 
severely restricts infiltration of stormwater into the earth. 
    Impervious surface means a surface that has been compacted or covered with a layer of material so

(Ord. No. 94-1, § 1, 4-19-94) 


Sec. 54-73. - Declaration. 
(a) ?The city presently owns and operates a stormwater system that has been developed over a number 
of years to serve the purpose of collecting, treating, storing and disposing of stormwater. A number 
of studies have been conducted by the city and other governmental entities, and such studies have 
indicated that it will be necessary and essential not only to continue to maintain existing facilities, but 
to construct further improvements and extensions to the stormwater system to ensure that the 
collection, treating, storing and disposal of stormwater within the city is accomplished in order to 
protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b) ?Those elements of the city stormwater system that provide for the collection, storage, treatment and 
conveyance of stormwater are of benefit and provide services to all developed property within the 
city. 
(c) ?The cost of operating and maintaining the stormwater management system and the financing of 
existing and future necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, 
to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services received 
therefrom. 
(d) ?Stormwater management facilities that are designed, constructed and maintained in accordance 
with the applicable state and local regulations and for the purpose of stormwater quality 
improvements are of benefit to and necessary for the public health, safety and welfare.

Sec. 54-74. - Fee. 
(a) ?Created. A stormwater management utility fee, also referred to as "fee," is hereby created and 
imposed on all developed property within the city for services and facilities provided by the 
stormwater management program. For the purposes of imposing the fee, all developed property 
within the city shall be classified into the following three classes. 
(1) ?Residential property. 
(2) ?Nonresidential property. 
(3) ?Mixed use property. 
(b) ?Schedule of rates. 
(1) ?The monthly EDU rate for each EDU shall be as follows: 
Single-family ..... $2.80 
Duplex ..... 1.83 
Multifamily ..... 2.51 
Hotel/motel ..... 2.17 
Commercial ..... 3.27 
Public property ..... 3.27 
Impervious single-family lots ..... 2.80 
The monthly rate may be amended by resolution of the city commission as deemed necessary. 
(2) ?The fee shall be calculated for each developed property as follows: 
a. ?The fee for property consisting solely of dwelling units is the rate of one EDU multiplied by 
the number of dwelling units existing on the property; that is, Fee = EDU rate × number of 
dwelling units. 
b. ?The fee for property with no dwelling units is the rate of one EDU multiplied by the 
numerical factor. The numerical factor is obtained by dividing the total impervious area in 
square feet of the nonresidential property by 1,513 square feet. The resulting calculation is, 
Fee = EDU rate × (impervious area expressed in square feet/1,513 square feet, but not 
less than the rate for one EDU). Fractional remainders shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 
EDU. 
c. ?The fee for mixed use property (dwelling units and commercial) is the rate of one EDU 
multiplied by the number of dwelling units existing on the property. The total on-site 
impervious area is then compared to the impervious areas allocated to dwelling units by 
multiplying the number of dwelling units by 1,513 square feet per dwelling unit and 
subtracting the resulting square footage of impervious area from the total impervious area. 
If the remaining impervious area is 0 or negative, the fee is the EDU rate times the number 
of dwelling units. If the remaining impervious area is greater than 0, then the additional fee 
for the remaining impervious area is calculated under subsection (b)(2)b. of this 
subsection. 
(3) ?The minimum fee for developed property, whether residential or nonresidential, within the city 
is equal to the rate for one EDU.

Sec. 54-75. - Billing; collecting; delinquency; penalty. 
(a) ?Bills for stormwater service shall be rendered bimonthly by the city. The fixed monthly charge shall 
be payable in advance. 
(b) ?If any bill shall not be paid within 14 days after the due date, water service to the premises may be 
disconnected until the delinquent account is paid in full, including all applicable disconnection and 
reconnection charges. 
(c) ?Statements for the fee shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the 
same penalties as they are otherwise set forth for other utility fees administered by the city. The 
property owner or fee payer will be notified of any delinquency in the payment of the fee in the same 
manner that delinquent garbage and sewer bills are notified; and the failure to pay such fee as is 
otherwise provided in the statement rendered to the payor shall subject the property to the 
discontinuance of water, garbage and sewer services and shall subject the fee payer to all other 
penalties and charges provided relative to the discontinuance of such utility services. 
(d) ?The administrative appeal and hearing procedure applicable to the discontinuance of utility services 
shall be applicable to the discontinuance of such services for the nonpayment of the fee. 
(Ord. No. 94-1, § 3, 4-19-94) 


Sec. 54-76. - Adjustment of fees. 
(a) ?Any owner, tenant or occupant who has paid the rendered fee and who believes that the fee is in 
error may, subject to the limitations set forth in this article, submit an adjustment request to the 
director. 
(1) ?Adjustment requests shall be made in writing and shall set forth in detail the grounds upon 
which the belief is made. 
(2) ?The director shall review the adjustment request within 90 days of the submittal of the request 
and shall respond in writing to the requesting fee payer, either denying or granting the request 
with the reason therefor stated in such response. 
(3) ?The rate adjustment, if granted, will apply retroactively to the date at which the erroneous 
information was applied to the fee payer's fee, but will not exceed one year prior to the 
adjustment request. 
(4) ?Upon denial of the adjustment request, the owner, tenant or occupant making the original 
adjustment request may, within 30 days of the receipt of the denial, petition for a review of the 
adjustment request by the city commission. The city commission shall review the adjustment 
request in accordance with the provisions set forth in this article as well as the documented 
evidence provided in the original adjustment request and supplemental evidence requested by

Sec. 58-92. - Restricted boating areas. 
(a) ?Definitions. 
(1) ?Slow speed-minimum wake indicates a restricted or controlled zone which has been 
established to protect the interest of the public. Slow speed-minimum wake means that a vessel 
must not proceed at a speed greater than that speed which is reasonable and prudent to avoid 
an excessive wake or condition under the existing circumstances. For the purpose of this 
section, slow speed-minimum wake and slow down-minimum wake shall mean the same. A 
motorboat in an area designated as a slow speed-minimum wake zone: 
a. ?That is operating on a plane is not proceeding at slow speed-minimum wake speed. 
b. ?That is in the process of coming off plane and settling into the water, which action creates 
more than no or minimum wake, is not proceeding at slow speed-minimum wake speed. 
c. ?That produces no wake or minimum wake is proceeding at slow speed-minimum wake 
speed. 
d. ?That is completely off plane and that has settled into the water and is proceeding without 
wake or with minimum wake is proceeding at slow speed-minimum wake speed. 
(2) ?Idle speed-no wake indicates a restricted or controlled zone that has been established to 
protect the interests of the public. Idle speed-no wake means that a vessel cannot proceed at a 
speed greater than that speed which is necessary to maintain steerageway. 
(b) ?Restricted boating areas. There shall be created within the city various restricted boating areas in 
the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which shall be marked by the city manager with regulatory buoy 
markers in compliance with the state uniform waterway marking system, which shall restrict all 
boating activities from these designated swimming areas pursuant to F.S. ch. 327 and the rules of 
the department of environmental protection, division of law enforcement, F.A.C. ch. 16N-23. 
(c) ?Zones. 
(1) ?Swim zones. The following areas shall be designated as swim zones; and all boating activity 
shall be restricted within an area that is located between the water line and a buoy line, which 
buoy line shall be located by the city manager at a point no greater than 300 feet out into the 
Gulf of Mexico from the mean high water line in the following locations: 
a. ?From the northernmost Blind Pass jetty north to the south end of Weckesser Park, a 
distance of approximately 5,711 feet. 
b. ?From the south side of Weckesser Park to north side of parking lot 5 (at 100th Avenue), a 
distance of approximately 2,445 feet. The width of the swim zone adjacent to 3rd Avenue 
South and Sawyer & Harrell's 2nd Addition, Block 8, Lots 13,14, and 15 and east eight feet 
of vacated alley on west and Lots 10, 11, 12 and vacated alley (a total distance of 200 
feet), shall be set by the city manager at no greater than 125 feet until March 31, 2009 
unless swimmer safety considerations dictate otherwise. Thereafter, the width of said swim 
zone may be adjusted by the city manager to up to 300 feet as may be needed to ensure 
the safety of swimmers. 
c. ?From the south end of the county park (104th Avenue) to the north end of 121st Avenue, a 
distance of approximately 5,200 feet. 
Within the restricted boating areas, no boating activity shall be allowed except as specifically 
authorized by the city manager for various city-authorized or city-sponsored events. This 
restriction applies to all boats that use a motor as their primary or secondary means of 
locomotion, kite surfing, sail-powered vessels 20 feet or greater in length and other similar 
vessels and devices. This restriction shall not apply to nonmotorized vessels including 
surfboards, sailboards and skimboards, canoes and kayaks. Sail-powered vessels under 20 feet 
in length may ingress and egress the beach perpendicular to the shoreline. 
(2) ?Idle speed—No wake zone. 
a. ?The following areas shall be designated as idle speed-no wake zones; and boating activity 
shall be restricted within an area that is located between the water line and a buoy line, 
which buoy line shall be located by the city manager at a point no greater than 300 feet out 
into the Gulf of Mexico from the mean high water line in the following locations: 
1. ?From the north end of 121st Avenue northward to the north end of 127th Avenue, a 
distance of approximately 1,800 feet. 
2. ?There is hereby created in the city an idle speed-no wake zone in the waterway of 
Boca Ciega Bay beginning opposite (north of) and between 180—108th Avenue (the 
parcel of the police/fire complex), to the southern shoreline of 110th Avenue, Isle of 
Palms and proceeding west by northwest to the south wall of the 112th Avenue 
bridge. 
The boundaries of the idle speed-no wake zone shall be deemed to be and include the areas 
within the locations indicated in subsection (f), which locations shall be marked by markers. 
Such markers and locations are also reflected in the diagram set forth in subsection (f).

the 116th Avenue bridge. This zone then continues north from the north wall of the 116th 
Avenue bridge to include all waters to a buoy located at the south border of Johns Pass at Key 
Capri. 
The boundaries of the slow speed-minimum wake shall be deemed to be and include the areas 
within the locations indicated in subsection (f), which locations shall be marked by markers. 
Such markers and locations are also reflected in the diagram set forth in subsection (f). 
(3) ?Slow speed-minimum wake zone. 
a. ?There is hereby created in the city a slow speed-minimum wake zone in the southeastern 
portion of John's Pass, extending roughly from a point beginning at the intersection of the

PREFACE 
    This Code, Subpart B constitutes a complete codification of the land development regulations of the 
City of Treasure Island, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code, Subpart B were ordinance number 95-10 and 
ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the 
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the 
section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative 
tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included 
herein. 
    The chapters of the Code, Subpart B have been conveniently arranged and the various sections 
within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code, 
Subpart B together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code, Subpart B is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code, Subpart B is the same system used in 
many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. 
The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the 
position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the 
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the 
same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for 
amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between 
sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles 
and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end 
of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article 
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New 
chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 63 
and 64, it will be designated as chapter 63.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of 
chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, Subpart B, the 
number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code, Subpart B at this time, and their 
corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and John 
Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bonnie Williams, Deputy City Clerk, and James Denhardt, City 
Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is 
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make 
the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-
day administration of the city's affairs.

PREFACE 
    This Code, Subpart A constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances 
of the City of Treasure Island, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code, Subpart A were the 1985 Code, as 
supplemented through February 17, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. 
The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. 
The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the 
adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader 
can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included 
herein. 
    The chapters of the Code, Subpart A have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the 
various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related 
sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the 
state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code, Subpart A is the same system used in 
many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. 
The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the 
position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the 
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the 
same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for 
amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between 
sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles 
and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end 
of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article 
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New 
chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the 
alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and John 
Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bonnie Williams, Deputy City Clerk, and James Denhardt, City 
Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is 
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make 
the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-
day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 62-4. - Adult use permits. 
(a) ?Permit required. No adult use establishment shall be allowed to commence or continue to operate 
without first obtaining a valid adult use permit. Any business entity or person desiring to locate, 
operate or continue operation of any adult use, shall be required to obtain an adult use permit from 
the city manager or his designee before the establishment or commencement of business as an 
adult use. Adult uses which have been established or have commenced business at their existing 
locations prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be required to obtain an adult use permit from 
the city manager or his designee within three months of the effective date of this chapter. 
(b) ?Fee; information required. In order to obtain an adult use permit, the applicant shall provide, in

(2) ?Street address and a legal description of the property containing the proposed or existing adult 
use. 
(3) ?A site plan of the proposed establishment. Unless a site plan is required by some other section 
of this Code, a professionally prepared diagram in the nature of an engineer's or architect's 
blueprint shall not be required. However, each site plan should be oriented to the north or to 
some designated street or object and shall be drawn to a designated scale or with marked 
dimensions sufficient to show the various dimensions of the site including property dimensions, 
building sizes, locations and sizes of the portions of the building containing the adult use, 
impervious surfaces and landscaping. 
Multi-tenant buildings shall show interior and exterior locations and sizes of the areas proposed 
to be occupied by all facets of the adult business use, and all setbacks from property lines and 
the types of uses by the tenants of all other spaces in the building. 
(4) ?Known locations of any churches, schools, child care facilities, public parks, public building, 
transportation/utility facility, public beach, or residential uses or other existing or proposed adult 
uses within approximately 250 feet of the proposed or existing adult use location for which the

(5) ?If the applicant's proposed location is the location of an already established adult use, the date 
of commencement of operations as an adult use including documentation of commencement, if 
available. 
(6) ?If the applicant is not the record owner of the subject parcel, the application must include a 
letter, with the notarized signature of the record owner, purporting to be the record owner, and 
stating that the applicant is authorized to seek an adult use permit for the subject parcel. 
(c) ?Issuance of permit. Upon receipt of a completed application, the city manager or his designee shall 
inspect the proposed location of the adult use and, within 21 days, issue a certificate of compliance 
or noncompliance. The city manager or his designee may extend that period of time at the request of 
the applicant for purposes of clarification of issues raised by the inspection, but in no event for an 
additional period of time in excess of 21 calendar days. 
(1) ?Certification of noncompliance. 
a. ?Where it is found that the location proposed in the application does not meet the distance 
requirements of this section or the location is one where a valid adult use exists or is one 
where a valid adult use permit or valid certification of compliance has been issued for 
another adult use, the location of which is within the distance requirements of this section 
from the proposed location, the city manager shall issue a certification of noncompliance. 
The applicant shall be notified of the certification of noncompliance of the proposed 
location with the locational requirements of this section by first class mail. 
b. ?Upon receipt of the certificate of noncompliance the applicant may appeal the certification 
of noncompliance to the city commission by filing a written notice of appeal with the city 
manager within ten days which shall include the fee established by the city commission for 
such appeals. The appeal shall be processed according to the provisions of this Code, 
regarding appeals to the city commission. 
(2) ?Certification of compliance. 
a. ?Where it is found that the applicant's proposed location meets the distance requirements of 
this section and where no valid adult use exists or where no valid adult use permit or valid 
certification of compliance has been issued for another adult use, the location of which is 
within the distance requirements of this section from the proposed location, the applicant 
shall be notified of the certification of compliance of the proposed location with the 
locational requirements of this section by first class mail. 
b. ?The applicant shall have 20 business days from the date of the certificate of compliance to 
obtain a preliminary adult use permit, which must be signed by the city manager. Failure to 
obtain the preliminary adult use permit within this time period invalidates the certification of 
compliance and the applicant must reapply. 
(3) ?Conflicting applications. 
a. ?The city commission recognizes the potential of creating nonconformities by granting adult 
use permits that conflict. The city commission also recognizes the potential of creating 
nonconformities by granting permits to the uses described in subsections 62-3(b)(1) and 
(2). The city manager shall develop a system for tracking potentially conflicting applications 
and for ranking them by date and time of application/date of establishment. 
Between two applications being processed at the same time which individually qualify 
under this section but would violate the locational requirements if both were to receive 
permits, the application which was completed and received by the city manager at the 
earliest date shall be notified that the proposed location has been certified in compliance 
pursuant to the provisions of this section. The applicant of the conflicting application shall 
be notified of that application's certification of noncompliance pursuant to the provisions of 
this section with a notation that the noncompliance was due to the earlier submittal of a 
conflicting application. 
b. ?Any applicant who has received a certification of noncompliance pursuant to the provisions 
of this subsection may use the prior application date in a resubmission for the purposes of 
establishing priority if the certificate of noncompliance was issued no more than seven 
months prior to the date of resubmitting a completed application. Otherwise the applicant 
must reapply. 
(d) ?Continuing validity of the adult use permit. 
(1) ?The preliminary adult use permit shall be valid for a period of six months after issuance during 
which time the applicant's adult use business must commence business. The validity of such 
preliminary adult use permit may be extended by the city manager one time for 90 days for 
good cause. Any decision to deny such an extension may be appealed to the city commission 
by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within ten days which shall include the 
fee established by the city commission for such appeals. The appeal shall be processed 
pursuant to the provisions of this Code regarding appeals to the city commission. If the city 
commission grants the appeal, the extension shall run from the date of expiration of the permit. 
(2) ?Once the applicant commences business, the applicant must obtain a permanent adult use 
permit. Adult use permits must be renewed annually by October 1 and shall expire on 
September 30 of each year. The adult use permit shall remain valid unless it expires or unless 
the business is voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days or more. The adult use permit is 
not an occupational license and the receipt of the adult use permit shall not relieve the adult use 
from obtaining an occupational license. Failure to obtain an adult use permit by October 1 of 
each year will subject the permittee to a penalty of ten percent of the permit fee per each month 
of delinquency. 
(3) ?Decisions by the city manager to revoke an otherwise valid adult use permit for voluntary 
discontinuance may be appealed to the city commission by filing a written notice of appeal with 
the city manager within ten days which shall include the fee established by the city commission. 
The appeal shall be processed according to the provisions of the Code of the city regarding 
appeals to the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 30-4, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 62-5. - Nonconforming adult uses. 
(a) ?Adult uses which have been established at their existing locations prior to the effective date of this 
chapter, and which are not in conformity with the locational requirements of this section, may 
continue to operate for one year after the effective date of this chapter unless terminated sooner for 
any reason including failure to obtain a valid adult use permit or voluntarily discontinued for a period 
of 30 days or more. Such nonconforming adult uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or 
altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. After the one year period, a 
nonconforming adult use shall be regarded as operating in violation of this section. 
(b) ?If two or more adult use business establishments are within 250 feet of one another, but otherwise 
in a permissible location, the adult use business establishment which first began continual operation 
at the particular location is the conforming use and the later-established adult use business 
establishment is nonconforming. 
(c) ?In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that, as applied to a particular 
nonconforming adult use, the one-year period for attaining conforming status is unenforceable, then 
a two-year period shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 30-5, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 62-6. - Variances. 
(a) ?If a proposed use is in violation of the locational requirements of this section the applicant may file 
with the city manager a written request for a variance from the locational restriction. If an applicant 
has received a certification of noncompliance because the location of the proposed adult use is in 
violation of the locational requirements of this section, then the applicant may file with the city 
manager a written request for a variance from the locational restrictions. Such requests shall be 
accompanied by the fee established by the city commission. Filing of such a request not later than 
ten calendar days after receiving notice of the certification of noncompliance shall preserve the 
pending status of the application for purposes of the review of conflicting applications. If the written 
request is filed more than ten calendar days after receiving such notice, then the date of filing such 
request shall be used for the purposes of the review of conflicting applications. 
(b) ?If a written request is filed with the city manager, a public hearing before the city commission shall 
be scheduled to consider the request for a variance. The city manager shall schedule a date for the 
hearing to be held within 60 days from the date the written request is received. 
(c) ?The city commission shall hear and consider evidence offered by any interested person in a public 
hearing scheduled with public notice. Public notice shall be given pursuant to the requirements for 
variance requests to the planning and zoning board and shall include property owners of record as 
shown by the tax rolls of the property appraiser within 200 feet of the proposed location. 
(d) ?The city commission may, in its discretion, grant a variance, with reasonable conditions, from the 
locational restrictions of this section if it makes the following findings: 
(1) ?That a sufficient physical barrier separates the use for which a variance is being sought from 
the land use(s) or adult use which has caused the use not to be in compliance with the distance 
requirements of this section, so as to substantially fulfill the purpose of the distance 
requirements in effectively buffering the nonadult use. Such physical barriers include, but are 
not limited to, limited access streets or highways, major streets, walls, buildings or other 
structures, natural or manmade waterways, or that the actual distances between the buildings is 
sufficiently in excess of the distance requirement. Where the adult use establishment was 
legally in existence upon the effective date of this chapter, the city commission may also 
consider the history of the site including criminal activity in the area and compliance with city 
codes, the length it has been at that location and other economic considerations. 
(2) ?That the strict application of the provisions of this chapter will work an undue hardship unique 
to the applicant for a particular location. 
(3) ?That all other applicable provisions of this chapter and the codes and ordinances of the city will 
be observed. 
(e) ?No variance to the distance requirement between two adult uses may be granted. 
(f) ?The criteria set forth herein shall be the only criteria applied by the city commission in considering 
variances under this section. The city commission may only grant a variance to the provisions of this 
section by a majority vote. Failure to reach a majority vote shall result in a denial of the variance. The 
decision of the city commission is final. 
(g) ?If the city commission denies the exemption, the applicant may not reapply for an exemption until at 
least 12 months have elapsed since the date of the city commission' action. 
(h) ?The grant of a variance as conditioned by the city commission under this subsection does not 
exempt the applicant from any other provisions of this section other than the locational restrictions. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 30-6, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 62-7. - Exterior portions and signage. 
(a) ?It shall be unlawful for an owner or operator of an adult use establishment to allow the merchandise 
or activities of the establishment to be visible from any point outside the adult use establishment. 
(b) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of an adult use establishment to allow the exterior 
portions of the adult use establishment to have flashing lights, or any words, lettering, photographs, 
silhouettes, drawings, or pictorial representations of any manner except to the extent permitted by 
the provisions of this section. 
(c) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of an adult use establishment to allow the exterior 
portions of the adult use establishment dealing with the color, scale, mass, building pattern, facade, 
articulation and architectural style to be inconsistent or incompatible with the residential or 
nonresidential structures in the neighborhood in which the adult use established is located. Such 
consistency and compatibility shall be required for the exterior color, any changes to the exterior of 
the existing building, including but not limited to roof, building materials, windows and porches and 
shall apply to any building additions or new development. 
(d) ?Signs shall not contain any flashing lights and shall contain no photographs, silhouettes, drawings 
or pictorial representation of any manner. These provisions shall supplement but not supersede the 
sign requirements of this Code.

ARTICLE I. - ADMINISTRATION 


DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 


Sec. 66-101.1 - Title. 
    These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the city, hereinafter 
referred to as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-101.2 - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within 
any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site 
improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, 
replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from 
the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and 
manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; 
installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-101.3 - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the 
Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and 
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of 
development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1) ?Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of 
flooding; 
(2) ?Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future 
flood damage; 
(3) ?Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of 
equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 
(4) ?Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the 
impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6) ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
hazard areas; 
(7) ?Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response 
to and recovery from flood events; 
(8) ?Meet the requirements of the national flood insurance program for community participation as 
set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22; and 
(9) ?Protect human life and health and minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated 
with flooding. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-101.4 - Coordination with the Florida Building Code. 
    This chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building 
Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida 
Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-101.5 - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended 
by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on 
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be 
increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped 
special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from 
flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood 
insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of 
Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the federal emergency management agency, 
requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the national flood 
insurance program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by 
compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-101.6 - Disclaimer of liability. 
    This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city commission or by any officer or employee 
thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision 
lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13)

    Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific 
requirement shall be applicable. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-102.2 - Areas to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the city, as established in section 66-102.3. 
(Ord. No. 13-10, § 3, 12-3-13) 


Sec. 66-102.3 - Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. 
    The flood insurance study for the county and incorporated areas dated September 3, 2003, and all 
subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all

substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a 
written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, 
stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk 
resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) 
for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below

limited to property under single ownership or a property owners' association. 
    Street, public means any street designed to serve more than one property owner which is dedicated 
to the public use and accepted for ownership and maintenance by the appropriate public agency; includes

and maintenance. A street designed to serve more than one property owners' association must be public. 
    Street wall means the part of a building that faces the street, but it generally refers to how and where 
several buildings line up to define a proper walking environment. At the most basic level, buildings should 
be set back an equal distance so that facades are even for as far as a pedestrian can see. A street wall 
helps to promote walking over automobile use by fostering a feeling of safety. Because the upper floors of 
urban buildings define an enclosed visual space for the pedestrian, they expand the view down the street. 
    Structural alteration means any change, except the repair or replacement, in the supporting 
members of a building such as bearing walls, columns, beams or girders; or the rearrangement of interior 
partitions and/or space affecting more than 20 percent of the total floor area of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home 
or other manmade facilities or infrastructures including, but not limited to fences, billboards, swimming 
pools, docks, poles, pipelines, transmission lines, tracks and advertising signs. A lawfully permitted 
mailbox, as provided for in subsection 68-458(e), shall not be deemed to be a structure. 
    Subdivision means the division of real property into two or more lots, parcels, tracts, tiers, blocks, 
sites, units or any other division of land, or if the establishment of new streets and alleys is involved, any 
division of such parcel. The term includes resubdivisions and, when appropriate to the text, relates to the 
process of subdividing or to the lands or area subdivided; however, the following shall be exempt: 
(1) ?The public acquisition of strips of land for the widening of existing streets; 
(2) ?The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where no new parcels 
or residual parcels smaller than any of the original lots are created; 
(3) ?The division of land into parcels greater than one and one-fourth acres where no new streets or 
easements of access are planned; 
(4) ?The transference of part of one lot or tract to an adjacent lot or tract provided the transference 
does not reduce any lot or tract to an area or width less than the minimum specified in this 
chapter. 
    Submerged land means the land area situated below the mean high water line of a standing body of 
water, including ocean, estuary, lake, pond, river or stream. For the purpose of this definition retention 
areas that are a function of development and wetlands shall not be considered submerged land. 
    Survey, certified means a survey, sketch, plan, map or other exhibit containing a written statement 
regarding its accuracy or conformity to specified standards certified and signed by the registered surveyor 
under whose supervision the survey was prepared. 
    Surveyor means a person licensed by the state to practice land surveying. 
    Temporary means a time period of not more than 90 days. 
    Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting 
one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed towers or monopole towers. The

any support thereto. 
    Townhouse or townhouse unit means an attached, privately owned single-family dwelling unit which 
is a part of and adjacent to other similarly owned single-family dwelling units that are connected to but 
separated from one another by no more than two party walls having no doors, windows, or other 
provisions for human passage or visibility. A townhouse or townhouse unit may only be developed with 
one dwelling unit. 
    Townhouse development means a site for the design and development of townhouse group(s) that 
allow for individual ownership of a townhouse or townhouse unit. 
Example #1: Townhouse Development with Common Areas 
 
Example #2: Townhouse Development without Common Area. 
The individual townhouse lots encompass all of the land in the townhouse development. Typically, there 
are easements recorded with the townhouse lots to ensure utility services and ingress/egress access is 
provided to each townhouse lot. 
 
    Townhouse group means a cluster or grouping of townhouse units containing no less than three and 
no more than ten townhouse dwelling units contiguous to one another. A townhouse group or groups are 
located in a townhouse development. The townhouse group consists of the attached townhouse units in 
one structure. 
    Townhouse lot means a recorded and deeded lot upon which a townhouse or townhouse unit is 
developed. Only one townhouse unit may be constructed on a townhouse lot. 
    Use, accessory. (See "accessory use.")

line and located between the required front, rear or waterfront yards. (See Attachment Two). 
 
    Yard, waterfront means a yard or any portion thereof on lots abutting a waterfront and extending 
across the full width of the lot or any portion thereof or parcel and measured from the mean high water 
line, property line or seawall, whichever is closer and the building setback line. 
    Zoning means the division of land within a jurisdiction into separate districts within which uses are 
permitted, prohibited or permitted as a special exception. Brief definitions of the different types of uses 
and structures as relates to zoning are explained in the article VI. Zoning establishes site regulations, 
such as building heights, density, floor area ratio, setbacks, building coverage, impervious surface ratio, 
etc. 
    Zoning districts are established to promote compatible patterns of land use within the city limits. 
Zoning districts also establish site development regulations and performance standards appropriate to the 
purposes and the uses allowed in each district. Distinct zoning districts exist for residential, resort, 
commercial, recreation/open space, etc. uses.

Sec. 68-3. - Purpose. 
(a) ?The purpose of this chapter is to establish comprehensive controls for the development of land in 
the city based on the comprehensive plan, as defined and designed to preserve the unique island 
character of the city enacted in order to protect, promote and improve the public health, safety, 
comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morale and general welfare of the people. 
(b) ?The objectives of this chapter are to provide for the efficiency and economy in the process of 
development; for the appropriate and best use of land; for preservation, protection, development and 
conservation of the natural resources of land, water and air; for convenience of traffic and circulation 
of people and goods; for the use and occupancy of buildings; for healthful and convenient 
distribution of population; for adequate public facilities and utilities; for promotion of the civic 
amenities of beauty and visual interest, and for development in accord with the comprehensive plan. 
(c) ?To accomplish these purposes, the city commission shall divide the entire city into zoning districts of 
such number, shape and size as may be deemed best suitable to carry out the purposes of the 
chapter, and within these zoning districts may regulate, determine and establish: 
(1) ?Height, number of stories, size, bulk, location, erection, construction repair, reconstruction, 
alteration and use of buildings and other structures, for trade, industry, residence and other 
purposes; 
(2) ?Use of land and water for trade, profession, residence and other purposes; 
(3) ?Size of yards and other open spaces; 
(4) ?Percentage of lot that may be occupied; 
(5) ?Density of population; 
(6) ?Conditions under which various classes of nonconformities may continue, including authority to 
set fair and reasonable amortization schedules for the elimination of nonconforming uses; 
(7) ?Use and types and sizes of structures in those areas subject to seasonal or periodic flooding so 
that danger to life and property in such areas will be minimized; 
(8) ?Performance standards for use of property and location of structures thereon. 
(d) ?All such regulations shall be uniform throughout each zoning district, but the regulations in one 
zoning district may differ from those in other zoning districts. For each zoning district designated for 
the location of trades, callings, industries, commercial enterprises, residences or buildings designed 
for specific uses, regulations may specify those uses that shall be excluded or subjected to 
reasonable requirements of a special nature.

Sec. 68-4. - Interpretation. 
    In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum 
requirements for the protection, promotion and improvement of the public health, safety, comfort, order, 
appearance, convenience, morale and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this chapter 
to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; 
provided, however, where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of building or premises, 
or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other 
ordinances, rules or regulations or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this chapter 
shall control. If, because of error or omission in the zoning map, any property in the city is not shown as 
being in a zoning district, the classification of such property shall be RU-75 single-family residential 
unless changed by amendment to the zoning map or by subsequent zoning ordinances.

Sec. 68-35. - Administrative waivers. 
(a) ?Purpose. Administrative waivers provide a process for the city staff to consider requests to waive or 
modify certain standards of this Code when, special circumstances applicable to the property, 
including location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other physical features, the strict 
application of the development regulations otherwise applicable to the property denies the property 
owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and in the same zoning district. 
(b) ?Applicability. An administrative waiver may be granted to waive or modify any requirement of the 
land development regulations (LDR) except: permitted land uses; density; floor area ratio; specific 
prohibitions (for example, prohibited signs), or procedural requirements. 
(c) ?Review authority. The CID director may approve an administrative waiver to grant relief from any of 
the following requirements of the LDR, up to a maximum variance of ten percent of the requirement 
or a maximum of one foot, whichever is smaller. 
(1) ?Distance between structures; 
(2) ?Parcel dimensions (not area); 
(3) ?Setbacks. 
An administrative waiver may also be used to grant relief from "on-site parking, loading, and landscaping" 
up to a maximum reduction of ten percent provided there is less than a one percent reduction in the 
impervious surface ratio on the site. 
(d) ?Application filing and processing. An application for an administrative waiver shall be completed, 
filed, the required application fee paid and processed in compliance with this chapter. It is the 
responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence in support of the findings required in subsection (f). 
(e) ?Project review, notice and hearing. Each application shall be reviewed by the CID director to ensure 
that the proposal complies with this section, and other applicable requirements of the LDR. The CID 
director may approve or deny an administrative waiver without a public hearing or public notice. 
(f) ?Findings and decision. The CID director may approve or deny an application for an administrative 
waiver. The CID director shall record the decision and the findings on which the decision is based. 
(1) ?General findings. The CID director may approve an administrative waiver only after first making 
all of the following findings. 
a. ?There are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, 
topography, location, or surroundings, so that the strict application of the LDR deprives the 
property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and within the same zoning 
district; 
b. ?The approval of the administrative waiver includes conditions of approval as necessary to 
ensure that the adjustment granted does not constitute a grant of special privileges 
inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and within the same 
zoning district; and 
c. ?The administrative waiver is consistent with the comprehensive plan, and any other 
adopted plan or policy of the city. 
(2) ?Reasonable accommodation. The CID director may also grant an administrative waiver to the 
site planning or development standards of the LDR in compliance with this section, based on 
the finding that the waiver is necessary to accomplish a reasonable accommodation of the 
needs of a disabled person, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
(3) ?Sanitation service. The CID director may also grant an administrative waiver to the site 
planning or development standards of the LDR in compliance with this section, based on the 
finding that the waiver is necessary to install a dumpster and provide traffic circulation on the 
site for the sanitation vehicle. 
(4) ?Improvements to existing buildings. The CID director may also grant an administrative waiver 
to a development standard of the LDR in compliance with this section, based on the finding that 
the improvement is required by the Florida Building Code. 
(g) ?Conditions of approval. In approving an administrative waiver, the CID director: 
(1) ?Shall impose conditions to ensure that the approval does not grant special privileges 
inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the 
property is located; and 
(2) ?May impose any reasonable conditions to ensure that the approval complies with the findings 
required by subsection (f). 
(h) ?Appeal procedures. A property owner that is denied an administrative waiver may file an appeal 
which will be heard by the planning and zoning board. The fee and process of the appeal shall follow 
the requirements of an "appeals to administrative decisions."

Comprehensive plan amendments will follow the procedures set forth in F.S. § 163.3184. 
(1) ?Application for an amendment to the comprehensive plan and future land use map. 
a. ?Pre-application. Before any application to amend the comprehensive plan or future land 
use map is filed by the owner of real property located in the city or by said owner's 
authorized agent or any resident of the city, the applicant shall attend a pre-application 
meeting with the community improvement department (CID) director. The purpose of the 
meeting is to discuss in general, the procedures for preparing a complete application, 
mailing responsibilities, and scheduled public hearing dates before the decision-making 
bodies in the city together with the appropriate state, regional and county agencies. 
b. ?Application filing. A request to amend the comprehensive plan and/or future land use map 
may be made by the city commission, planning and zoning board/local planning agency,

comprehensive plan and/or future land use map by a property owner of the city. 
(2) ?Public hearing. In addition to the notice required by Florida Statutes, notice for each public 
hearing before the local planning agency and city commission shall be mailed by the applicant 
to all persons by certificate of mailing who, according to the most recent tax rolls, own property 
within 200 feet of the property proposed for rezoning (PD rezoning requires 500 feet 
notification). The notice shall be mailed at least ten days before the scheduled public hearing. 
The expense of this mailing shall be borne by the applicant. 
(3) ?Local planning agency. After review of the application by staff, the CID director shall have a 
draft ordinance prepared, which, if adopted by the city commission, would affect the proposed 
changes of the comprehensive plan and/or future land use map. The CID director shall forward

recommend approval of a plan amendment unless it makes a positive finding, based on 
competent evidence, on each of the following: 
a. ?The proposed plan amendment will meet the acceptable level of service standards 
established in the comprehensive plan. 
b. ?The proposed plan amendment is in harmony with the general intent of the comprehensive 
plan; 
c. ?A change in land use designation must be compatible with adjacent land uses, and one 
that will not become a potential nuisance; and 
d. ?A change in land use designation must be compatible with the current and future use of 
adjacent and nearby properties to justify the proposed change and will not negatively affect 
the property values of adjacent and nearby properties. 
(5) ?Review and consideration by city commission. The city commission shall review and consider 
the application for a comprehensive plan and/or future land use amendment after the local 
planning agency and CID director make their recommendation. The CID director shall prepare a 
written report to submit to the city commission which includes the recommendation of the local 
planning agency and the draft ordinance. The city commission shall hold the first reading and 
public hearing of an ordinance approving the application. If the city commission approves the 
application for an amendment to the comprehensive plan and/or future land use map on first 
reading, the ordinance shall be forwarded to the appropriate local, regional and state agencies 
for review and comment. 
(6) ?[ CID director's report. ] The CID director shall report to the appropriate state, regional and 
county agencies, the plan amendments approved by the city commission for consistency review 
pursuant to F.S. § 163.3184.

each application for possible negative effects including but not limited to consideration of the 
following: 
(1) ?The existing land use pattern; compatible with the purpose and intent of the applicable 
comprehensive plan goals, objectives and policies; 
(2) ?The population density pattern of the area and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on 
public facilities such as utilities and streets; 
(3) ?The possible overloading of the city's sewage collection facilities; 
(4) ?The possible overloading of the city's drainage system; 
(5) ?The proposed change would create an isolated zoning district unrelated to adjacent and nearby

permitting such use. 
(e) ?Review and consideration by city commission. The city commission shall review and consider the 
application for rezoning after the local planning agency and CID director make their 
recommendation. The CID director shall prepare a written report to submit to the city commission 
which includes the recommendation of the local planning agency and the draft ordinance. The city 
commission shall hold two readings and public hearings to consider the application for a proposed 
rezoning. If the city commission approves the application for rezoning, the rezoning ordinance

ARTICLE IV. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 


Sec. 68-151. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article is intended to ensure the availability of public facilities and the adequacy of those 
facilities at adopted levels of service concurrent with the impacts of development. This intent is 
implemented by means of a concurrency management system which shall measure the potential impact 
of a development permit application upon the adopted minimum acceptable level of service for roadway, 
solid waste, potable water, sanitary sewage, stormwater or park facility and/or service as provided in the 
capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-76, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-152. - Adopted levels of service. 
    The level-of-service (LOS) standards for roads, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water, 
coastal management, and parks and recreation facilities shall be those most recently adopted in the 
capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan and the Treasure Island Master Drainage 
Plan (stormwater management and flood control levels of service only). 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-77, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 00-08, § 8, 1-9-01) 


Sec. 68-153. - Concurrency review—General requirements. 
    A certificate of concurrency shall be required prior to the issuance of any development permit. If a 
development will require more than one development permit, the issuance of a certificate of concurrency 
shall occur prior to the issuance of the initial development permit. For preliminary development orders, a 
concurrency review shall be performed and a conditional certificate of concurrency issued. This 
conditional certificate of concurrency shall not be binding upon the city. Only those certificates of 
concurrency issued for development permits shall be binding. A certificate of concurrency shall 
automatically expire simultaneously with the expiration of the development permit to which it applies. In 
the event that the development permit does not have a specified expiration date, the certificate of 
concurrency shall expire one year from the date of the issuance of the development permit. In the event 
that a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of the development permit, then the accompanying 
certificate of concurrency shall be automatically renewed for up to one year after the date of the issuance 
of the initial development permit. Should the extension equal or exceed one year from the date of the 
issuance of the initial development permit, a new concurrency review shall be performed for which a 
reasonable fee shall be assessed in order to defray the cost of the new review. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-78, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-154. - Same—Burden of proof. 
    The burden of showing compliance with the adopted levels of service and meeting the concurrency 
evaluation shall be upon the applicant. The city manager or his/her designee will direct the applicant to 
the appropriate staff to assist in the preparation of the necessary documentation and information. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-79, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-155. - Exemptions. 
(a) ?De minimis development. Single-family and duplex dwellings, to be constructed on existing lots in 
subdivisions approved for such uses (residential infill), shall be considered de minimis and exempt 
from concurrency review. Other developments or redevelopments shall be considered to have de 
minimis impacts and be exempt from concurrency review provided that they comply with all of the 
following conditions: 
(1) ?The net increase in traffic (peak hour) generated by the proposed development onto any 
affected roadway may not exceed one percent of the maximum service capacity of the roadway 
at the adopted peak-hour level-of-service standard. 
(2) ?The net increase in traffic (peak hour) generated by the proposed development, added to the 
total net increases in peak-hour traffic generated by all previously-approved de minimis 
exemptions on any affected roadway, may not exceed ten percent of the maximum service 
capacity of the roadway at the adopted peak-hour level-of-service standard. 
(3) ?The net increase in traffic (peak hour) generated by the proposed development onto any 
affected roadway designated as a hurricane evacuation route may not cause the actual level of 
service of the roadway to fall below the adopted peak-hour level-of-service standard. 
(b) ?Vested projects. Nothing in this article shall be construed or applied to constitute a temporary or 
permanent taking of private property without the just compensation nor abrogation of vested rights. 
Any applicant for a development order who alleges that this article, as applied, constitutes or would 
constitute a temporary or permanent taking of private property or an abrogation of vested rights must 
affirmatively demonstrate the legal requisites of the claim by meeting all three of the following 
conditions: 
(1) ?A final development order has been issued on or prior to the adoption of this Code; 
(2) ?Development has commenced; and 
(3) ?Development is continuing in good faith. 
Upon demonstrating that all three conditions are met, the applicant will be issued a certificate of 
exemption from concurrency review by the city clerk/administrator or his/her designee.

Sec. 68-156. - Minimum requirements for concurrency (standards). 
(a) ?Potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste and drainage. For potable water, sanitary sewer, solid 
waste and drainage, one of the following conditions must be satisfied in order to obtain a certificate 
of concurrency: 
(1) ?The necessary public facilities and services are in place at the time the development permit is 
issued; 
(2) ?The development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary public facilities 
and services shall be in place prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or statement of 
zoning compliance, whichever may be applicable; 
(3) ?The necessary public facilities and services are under construction at the time the development 
permit is issued; 
(4) ?The necessary public facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development 
agreement, pursuant to F.S. §§ 163.3220—163.3243, or development-of-regional-impact (DRI) 
approval, in accordance with F.S. § 380.06. 
(b) ?Parks and recreation. New residential developments and redevelopments, including subdivision 
plats and replats, which result in a net increase in dwelling units must provide for any additional 
unmet recreation and open space needs which they may create. In order to obtain a certificate of 
concurrency, one of the conditions provided for in subsection (a), or one of the following conditions, 
must be satisfied: 
(1) ?At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the 
subject of a binding contract which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of 
the required facilities or the provision of service, at a location other than the development site 
and at the developer's expense, within one year of the issuance of the development permit. 
(2) ?The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development 
agreement or development-of-regional-impact (DRI) approval which requires the 
commencement of the actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services, 
at a location other than the development site and at the developer's expense, within one year of 
the issuance of the applicable development permit. An "enforceable development agreement" 
may include, but is not limited to, a development agreement executed in accordance with F.S. 
§§ 163.3220—163.3243. A "development of regional impact" shall be as defined and approved 
in accordance with F.S. § 380.06. 
(3) ?Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or statement of zoning compliance, whichever is 
applicable, the developer has provided on-site recreation area(s) and facilities, dedicated other 
land to the city for open space and/or public recreational purposes, and/or paid a recreational 
impact fee per additional dwelling unit, in the amount established by the city commission, to be 
used by the city to acquire and/or develop the necessary additional recreation area(s) and 
facilities. Any combination of the above measures may be approved by the planning and zoning 
board in order to compensate for the additional impacts of the proposed development. 
(c) ?Roads. For roads, the following condition, or one of the conditions of subsections (a) and (b) must 
be satisfied in order to obtain a certificate of concurrency: The five-year schedule of capital 
improvements demonstrates that the actual construction of the needed road facility or service will be 
scheduled to commence in or before the third year. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-81, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 00-08, §§ 10, 11, 1-9-01; Ord. No. 11-08, § 3, 11-1-
11; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-157. - Concurrency review; procedure and evaluation. 
(a) ?The city shall use the procedures specified in subsection (c) to determine compliance of an 
application for a development permit with this concurrency management system. At the time of 
application for a development permit, a concurrency evaluation shall be made to determine the 
availability of the facilities or services required to be concurrent. 
(b) ?An applicant for a development permit shall provide the city with all information required by the city 
so as to enable the concurrency evaluation to be made. This shall include all of the information 
required in the "Submission Requirements and Methodology for Calculating Projected Demand for 
Certificate of Concurrency," a copy of which is attached hereto labeled Exhibit A, and made a part 
hereof by reference and printed at the end of this article. Official copies of "Exhibit A" shall be made 
available to the general public for inspection and copying. 
(c) ?Upon receipt of a complete concurrency review application, the city manager or his/her designee 
shall perform the following concurrency evaluation: 
Concurrency Review-Evaluation 
    The methodology for determining whether the levels of service of city facilities are adequate to 
support the impact of proposed developments is in Exhibit A at the end of this article. The levels of 
service of all six city facilities and services must be sufficient before a development permit can be issued. 
(1) ?For sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, and potable water: The concurrency evaluation shall 
compare the available capacity to the demand of the proposed development. The available 
capacity shall be determined by adding together: 
a. ?The total of the existing excess capacity, if any; and 
b. ?The total future capacity of any proposed construction or expansion that meets the 
standards of section 68-156. 
A certificate of concurrency shall be issued only if one of the following conditions are met: the 
available capacity exceeds the demand of the proposed development or one of the standards of 
subsection 68-156(a) is met. 
(2) ?For parks and recreation: The concurrency evaluation shall compare the available capacity to 
the demand of the proposed development. The available capacity shall be determined by 
adding together available capacity to the demand of the proposed development. The available 
capacity shall be determined by adding together: 
a. ?The total of the existing excess capacity, if any; and 
b. ?The total future capacity of any proposed construction or expansion that meets the 
standards of subsections 68-156(a) and (b). 
A certificate of concurrency shall be issued only if one of the following conditions are met: the 
available capacity exceeds the demand of the proposed development or one of the standards of 
subsections 68-156(a) and (b) is met. 
(3) ?For roads: 
a. ?The concurrency evaluation shall compare the existing level of service standards for the 
impacted roads to the level of service standards, as adopted, for the same. The existing 
level of service shall be based upon existing roads, including any proposed improvements 
to those roads, meeting the minimum requirements for concurrency as set forth in 
subsections 68-156(a) through (c). 
b. ?If the impact of the proposed development does not result in a degradation of the affected 
roads below the adopted level of service standard, or if one of the standards of subsections 
68-156(a) through (c) is met, then a certificate of concurrency shall be issued. 
c. ?If the city determines that a certificate of concurrency will not be issued, that determination 
shall be reduced to writing, signed by the city manager making the determination, and sent 
by U.S. Mail to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-82, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-158. - Annual capacity report. 
    An annual capacity report shall be prepared each year in conjunction with the development of the 
capital improvement element of the comprehensive plan. This report shall summarize the actual current 
capacity of public facilities and services for each of the five succeeding fiscal years. This annual capacity 
report shall constitute prima facie evidence of the capacity and level of service of public facilities for the 
purpose of issuing development permits during the 12 months following completion of the annual report. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-83, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-159. - Appeals. 
(a) ?A denial of a certificate of concurrency may be appealed by the applicant to the planning and zoning 
board. A notice of appeal specifying each and every ground in support of granting the certificate of 
concurrency shall be submitted by the applicant to the city manager or his/her designee, within 20 
days from the date of the written denial of the certificate of concurrency. The city manager or his/her 
designee, shall schedule the appeal to be heard at a public meeting by the planning and zoning 
board, and shall transmit to the planning and zoning board all papers constituting the record upon 
which the action appealed from was taken. 
The city manager or his/her designee, shall notify the applicant in writing of the date, time and location of 
the planning and zoning board meeting at which the appeal shall be heard. During the appeal proceeding, 
the applicant may appear in person or be represented by an agent or attorney. Applicants may be 
required to assume such reasonable costs as the city commission may determine by resolution, in setting 
fees to be charged for appeals. 
(b) ?The applicant shall have the burden of proof to establish by the presentation of substantial 
competent evidence to the planning and zoning board: 
(1) ?That there was an error in the technical determination made by the city manager to deny the 
certificate of concurrency; or 
(2) ?That one or more of the conditions in section 68-156 are satisfied such that the necessary 
public facilities and services will be available concurrent with the impact of the development. 
(c) ?Before recommending issuance of a certificate of concurrency, the planning and zoning board shall 
make specific findings that the certificate of concurrency satisfies subsections 68-156(b)(1) or (b)(2). 
The affirmative vote of six members of the planning and zoning board shall be necessary to 
recommend issuance of a certificate of concurrency. Action taken by the planning and zoning board 
to adopt, amend or rescind the administrative decision to deny the certificate of concurrency shall be 
documented in writing in the form of a resolution, signed by the chairman or vice-chairman, 
specifying the grounds therefore. The written decision of the planning and zoning board shall be 
submitted by the city clerk or his/her designee to the city commission for final action. The city clerk or 
his/her designee shall give written notice to the applicant of the date, time and location of the city 
commission meeting considering the certificate of concurrency. The city commission, upon reviewing 
the record and findings of the planning and zoning board, may adopt, amend or rescind the decision 
of the planning and zoning board. If deemed necessary by the city commission, in order to 
supplement the record, the city commission may receive additional testimony and may make inquiry 
of the applicant and administrative staff. The decision of the city commission shall be reduced to 
writing in the form of a resolution and shall be final upon the date of execution of the resolution by 
the mayor. 
EXHIBIT A  
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATION AND METHODOLOGY FOR  
CALCULATING PROJECTED DEMAND FOR CERTIFICATES  
OF CONCURRENCY 
(1) ?Purpose. The purpose of this Exhibit is to set forth the minimum submission requirements 
necessary for the city to review proposed developments for concurrency, as well as to provide a 
methodology for calculating the projected demand of a proposed project. 
(2) ?Submission requirements. The applicant must supply the following information along with a 
reasonable fee, as may be amended from time to time by the city commission to defray the cost 
of the review: 
a. ?Name of owner and/or agent/applicant. 
b. ?Current address of owner and/or agent/applicant. 
c. ?Phone number of owner and/or agent/applicant. 
d. ?Legal description of site.

j. ?Any expected special service demands generated by the proposed development (such as 
solid/hazardous waste demands of a hospital). 
k. ?Data as required by subsequent sections of this Exhibit. 
(3) ?Facility/service demand calculations. The projected public facility/service demands of the 
proposed project described in an application for concurrency review shall be calculated using 
the conversion factors and formulae listed below, and the adopted levels of service (LOS) in the 
capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan. Nonresidential uses are included 
in the adopted LOS. The calculations are listed by public facility and service type. Whenever the 
term "city" shall appear herein, it shall mean the city manager or his/her designee authorized to 
review calculations for the concurrency management system. The information necessary to 
enable the city to perform and/or verify the facility/service demand calculations in paragraphs 
(3)a. through (3)f. shall be provided by the applicant. 
a. ?Potable Water 
Adopted LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city comprehensive 
plan 
Adopted LOS (gallons/person/day) × 1.84 persons/unit × number of units = demand 
(gallons/day) 
b. ?Sanitary Sewer 
Adopted LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city comprehensive 
plan 
Adopted LOS (gallons/person/day) × 1.84 persons/unit × number of units = demand 
(gallons/day) 
c. ?Stormwater Management (Drainage) 
Adopted LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city comprehensive 
plan and the Treasure Island Master Drainage Plan (flood control only) 
d. ?Solid Waste 
Adopted LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city comprehensive 
plan adopted LOS (pounds/day/person) × 1.84 persons/unit × number of units = demand 
(pounds/day) 
e. ?Recreation 
Adopted open space LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city 
comprehensive plan 
Project population = number of dwelling units × 1.84 persons/unit 
Project population × adopted LOS (acres/person) = demand (total acres) 
f. ?Transportation 
Adopted LOS = as adopted in the capital improvements element in the city comprehensive 
plan 
1. ?Determine the number of trips generated by the proposed project during the p.m. peak 
hour, using the most recent edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers trip generation 
report, or other recognized source of data, with no adjustment for internal capture or 
passerby trips. 
2. ?If the total number of daily trips is equal to or greater than 450 trips, a transportation 
study shall be done. The study shall be signed and/or sealed by a registered 
Professional Engineer. 
i. ?If no transportation study is required, the applicant is required to provide only the 
existing peak hour traffic volumes and level of service for the roadway link(s) to 
which the project driveways connect. This information shall include project traffic. 
ii. ?The data shall be in conformance with Notes 2.(a) and 2.(b) of "Existing 
Conditions" below. 
(4) ?Performance of transportation study 
If a transportation study is required, it shall be obtained and submitted to the city by the 
applicant for a development permit at the applicant's sole expense. Should the city not have the 
expertise to review the transportation study or should it have justification to claim that the 
methodology and/or results of the initial transportation study are biased, untrue or otherwise 
inadequate, a third party consultant shall be hired by the city at the applicant's sole expense, to 
verify the initial transportation study. The city shall select the third party consultant from a list of 
consultants retained by the city for this purpose. The applicant shall reimburse the city for the 
total fee charged by the third party consultant to perform the transportation study, to include city 
administrative costs. 
The transportation study shall be performed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 
paragraph (5) hereof. Projects which are required to undergo development of regional impact 
review pursuant to F.S. § 380.06 shall be exempt from the requirements of this transportation 
study and instead shall submit a copy of the application for development approval to the city as 
required by state statutes. 
(5) ?Requirements of transportation study 
a. ?Pre-Application Meeting 
A pre-application meeting between the city and the applicant is required. The purpose of 
this meeting will be to review the methodology and procedure, establish the study area, 
and to determine the study period. 
b. ?Define Study Area 
The study area is defined as those roadways and intersections impacted by the project to 
an extent of one percent or more of peak-hour capacity at the level of service (LOS) 
adopted in the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan. In addition, 
other variables such as distance from site (e.g., five-mile radius for a DRI project) may also 
be used. 
c. ?Existing Conditions 
The following existing conditions shall be provided: 
1. ?Existing daily and peak hour traffic volumes and level of service on all arterials and 
collectors within the study area. 
2. ?Existing LOS at all impacted intersections. 
Notes: 
(a)?The above required data shall be no older than the previous calendar year. 
Roadway volumes shall be adjusted to reflect annual conditions using current FDOT 
seasonal adjustment factors for the county or other adjustment factors approved by 
the city. 
(b)?The above required level(s) of service for roadways shall be determined in 
accordance with current FDOT Generalized Level of Service volume tables and 
procedures presented in the most current Level of Service Standards and Guidelines 
Manual, or by use of other accepted traffic operations models subject to approval in 
the pre-application meeting. 
(c)?The above required intersection levels of service shall be determined using 
computer software based on the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual, 
Special Report 209, Transport Research Board, National Research Council. 
d. ?Projection of Background Traffic 
Volume(s) shall be projected for all phases of the development as well as the year of the 
project completion. Volumes can be determined using one of the following procedures: 
1. ?Multiplying existing volumes by an annual growth factor provided by the city. Traffic 
generated by any major project approved since the traffic counts were conducted shall 
be included as background traffic. 
2. ?Multiply existing volumes by an annual growth factor developed by the applicant and 
approved by the city. This growth factor must be based on data collected on five 
roadways in the vicinity of the project over the last ten years. Traffic generated by any 
major project approved since the traffic counts were conducted shall be included as 
background traffic. 
3. ?Projected roadway volumes resulting from a travel demand computer model of the 
area. 
e. ?Project Traffic Generation 
The following procedures and information shall be provided: 
1. ?To determine project traffic generation, the current edition of ITE Trip Generation 
Report shall be used. 
2. ?Identify all zoning districts, amount of development and trip rates. 
3. ?Trip rates may be obtained from studies of comparable sites in the city or using data 
from previous traffic generation studies, and are subject to the approval of the city. 
4. ?Any proposed reduction factors for capture of trips between land uses of a mixed use 
project or for passerby trips shall be provided by the applicant at the methodology 
meeting and approved by the city. 
f. ?Project Traffic Distribution 
1. ?If the project generates fewer than 100 peak hour trips, the distribution can be 
developed based on those of similar projects. 
2. ?For any project, manual gravity model distribution can be developed. The travel-time 
method described in Chapter 3 of ITE Transportation and Land Development may be 
used. 
3. ?For any project, computerized distribution models, such as FSUTMS or QRSII, can be 
developed. 
g. ?Alternative Demand Calculations 
If the applicant claims the standards provided in the demand calculations are not 
applicable to the proposed project, the applicant shall submit appropriate documentation 
supporting the proposed alternative demand calculation to the city. Any alternative 
calculation standard shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-84, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 00-08, §§ 12, 13, 1-9-01; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-160. - Proportionate fair share program and the process for the application of concurrency 
management for transportation facilities. 
    The purpose of the proportionate fair share provisions in this section is to establish a method 
whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative 
efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair share program, as required 
by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). The proportionate fair share program represents 
an alternative method for meeting concurrency requirements and provides for the application of 
concurrency management provisions in a coordinated and cooperative manner. In addition, this section 
adopts the county's approach to concurrency management for transportation facilities. In this section, the 
term deficient facility means a road operating below the adopted level of service standard. 
(a) ?Where applicable, the city shall participate in the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) 
annual process of establishing a countywide concurrency corridor map. 
(b) ?Where applicable, the city shall adopt the metropolitan planning organization's countywide 
approach to the application of concurrency management for transportation facilities. 
(c) ?Due to its small size and lack of deficient facilities, the city's transportation concurrency matters 
are reviewed and monitored by the county. For that reason, it is important that the city's 
application of concurrency management for transportation facilities and the proportionate fair

Sec. 68-410.09. - Setbacks. 
    To encourage pedestrian movement, there will be three zones: 
(a) ?"Utility zone" is the area within the right-of-way which is used for sidewalks, street furnishings, 
street signage, traffic control devices, public sidewalk and light poles. 
 
(b) ?"Pedestrian friendly zone" is a four-foot wide improved walkway constructed by the property 
owner on private property which is adjacent and parallel to the utility zone. Any awning or 
structure shall be built at a minimum of ten feet above grade. There may be a sign, lighting 
and/or fan which may be hung from the underside of structure. There must be eight-feet of 
vertical clearance. This shall be an unobstructed pedestrian walkway which extends the entire 
width of the property. 
(c) ?"Dining area/outside display zone" is an area eight-foot wide adjacent and parallel to the front 
building façade and the pedestrian zone. Any awning or arcade structure shall be built a 
minimum of ten feet above grade. There may be a sign, lighting and/or fan which may be hung 
from the underside of the structure. There must be eight feet of vertical clearance. This zone 
extends the entire width of the lot. This area may be used for landscaping, dining, and outside 
display of merchandise sold within the store. 
 
With the redevelopment of each site, the property owner shall build: 
•?A structural arcade; 
•?Provide one wide awning the width of the building; or 
•?A series of awnings the width of the building. 
The arcade/awning(s) serve to protect pedestrians from the elements. (i.e. sun, rain, etc.) 
Front setbacks: 
107 th Avenue 
At ground level only, the property owner's building façade will be built a minimum of 12 feet 
from the 107 th Avenue right-of-way line and shall be aligned parallel to the right-of-way line 
in order to create a street wall. 
Each arcade or awning shall be a minimum of 12 feet deep to cover both the pedestrian 
and dining/outside display zone. 
"Dining area/outside display zone" shall be a minimum of eight feet in width. 
The 2 nd story of each building and above setback is zero and may extend out over the 
dining area/outside display area and the pedestrian zone along 107 th Avenue. 
Along the north-south pedestrian-ways, the setback shall be zero feet. 
Gulf Boulevard (State Route 699), 104 th , 106 th and 108 th Avenues. 
"Dining area/outside display zone" shall be a minimum of five feet in width. 
At ground level only along Gulf Boulevard, 104 th , 106 th and 108 th Avenues, the front 
setback shall be a minimum of 9 feet. The 2 nd story of each building and above setback is 
zero and may extend out over the dining area / outside display zone and the pedestrian 
zone. 
Along the north-south pedestrian-ways, the setback shall be zero feet. 
Side setbacks: The side setbacks shall be zero in order to establish a continuous street wall for 
the downtown activity center. 
Rear setbacks: The rear setback shall be zero when the rear alley or alley/cross-easement is 24 
feet in width. Where there is not a 24 feet wide alley or cross-easement, the rear setback shall 
be varied to provide the necessary distance to accommodate the 24 feet, a two-way vehicular 
travel width at the rear of the property. 
 
Example of one awning placed over the pedestrian and dining/outside display zone. The awning 
provides protection for the pedestrians but limits the development from having the ability to build 
gross floor area above the pedestrian and dining/outside display zone. 
 
Example of multiple awnings placed over the pedestrian and dining/outside display zone. The 
awnings provide some protection for the pedestrians but limit the development from having the 
ability to build gross floor area above the pedestrian and dining and outside display zone. 
 
The 2 nd floor is stepped back from the front façade of the ground floor. 
The step back area on the 2 nd floor may be used for a deck/balcony. 
The center structure may be a live-work unit. 
It is preferable to have the buildings create a continuous street-wall to ensure the arcade is 
continuous for pedestrians. Note in the photograph above that the front facades are established 
at different setbacks. 
 
A commercial building with an arcade along both street frontages. The second floor area above 
the dining/display area is used as a balcony for the second floor uses. 
 
Recessed entrance is emphasized with overhead awnings, planters and a change in pavement 
appearance.

Subdivision III. - Treasure Island Downtown Design Criteria 


Sec. 68-410.50. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of the design criteria is to secure visual interest, identity and sense of place 
in the city's downtown. These design provisions are intended to focus on the characteristics of 
architectural compatibility and to leave individual property-owners the maximum flexibility to build to meet 
their own needs and objectives. A variety of uses are encouraged on the ground floor to create active 
urban spaces for pedestrians. Retail, restaurant, service and arts-related uses are favored to take 
advantage of and generate pedestrian traffic. 
    The criteria shall apply to all new construction projects within downtown. The provisions are 
expected to be useful for making design decisions about permanent residential units, transient residential 
units, and commercial construction at a number of levels: 
•?Property-owners, builders, architects and other designers are encouraged to consult the design 
criteria prior to designing new buildings, additions or remodeling projects for ideas and advice. 
•?The design criteria will be used by city staff in making permit decisions. 
•?City property owners should consult the design criteria to understand the compatibility 
concepts which will apply to new construction. 
 
    Courtyards and outdoor areas shall be designed to enhance surrounding buildings and provide 
appropriate amenities for users (e.g. textured paving, landscaping, lighting, street trees, benches, trash 
receptacles, street furniture, and public art). Generally courtyards should have recognizable edges 
defined on at least three sides by buildings, walls, landscaping, and street furniture. In the PR-MU Gulf 
Boulevard Zoning District, only two sides need to define the edge. The rear yard may be left open to 
enjoy the waterfront view of Boca Ciega Bay. 
 
Covered area provides sheltered location for dining and display. 
 
The photograph shows a multiuse building with a courtyard along the right side of the 
structure. 
 
A close-up photograph of the courtyard.  
The courtyard expands the visibility of the retail storefronts and offers a location for outdoor 
display and dining. 
 
The courtyard on the left side of the building provides location for seating, public art and 
landscaping.  
The arcade is shown along the secondary street.  
The floor above the arcade is used as a balcony 
    Live-work units provide for both a commercial and residential function. The commercial function is 
generally on the ground floor. The second floor may be occupied by a business operator who resides 
upstairs in the same structure that contains the commercial activity. Live-work units are well-suited for 
downtown areas. 
 
Live-Work Unit 
    The following criteria shall guide the design of new development in a manner that strengthens the 
city's mixed-use commercial core: 
All new building construction must conform to the land development standards of the zoning district 
in which it is located. The criteria presented herein are intended to go beyond the basic dimensional 
requirements and, in greater detail, address issues specifically related to character compatibility. 
In addition, the criteria are intended to encourage the design and construction of buildings which 
harmonize with the surroundings and which demonstrate a high standard of quality. 
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.51. - Applicability. 
    The transition to applying this criterion to development projects shall be as follows: 
Any development within downtown approved by the planning and zoning board and/or the city 
commission on or before January 6, 2015, is not subject to these regulations. 
In the event of a major revision to an existing draft approval where the developer has an approved 
site plan or development agreement, the planning and zoning board and/or the city commission will 
generally apply these regulations. 
Any development within the downtown approved by the planning and zoning board or city 
commission after January 6, 2015, shall provide conformity to these design parameters. 
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.52. - Waivers. 
    Every business is unique. All aspects of appearance and character cannot be fully listed within the 
downtown design criteria. A process shall be available to allow waivers of specific aspects of these 
criteria. A request for a waiver shall not be considered a variance. A design criteria waiver in the planned 
redevelopment areas shall be evaluated administratively using the findings listed below together with the 
countywide rules in Section 6.4.3.1. The requested change in design criteria: 
•?Shall not damage the character or quality of the neighborhood in which it is located, or hinder 
the proper future development of the surrounding properties; 
•?Shall not generate excessive vehicular traffic; 
•?Shall not create a vehicular parking or pedestrian/traffic circulation problem; 
•?Shall not compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and 
•?Shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of the city's downtown design criteria. 
    In addition to design criteria waiver in the planned redevelopment area, a de minimis variation not 
exceeding ten percent of the required standard as applied to setbacks, impervious area, floor area ratio 
and similar measurable criteria may be granted administratively. Changes to impervious area and floor 
area ratio will also need to be in compliance with the countywide rules. De minimis does not apply to 
density. 
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.53. - Style and building form. 
    The city contains a wide variety of architectural designs. New development should continue to 
provide a mix of architectural styles in order to maintain the variety of building forms. New construction 
should be compatible in massing, scale, proportion and articulation. 
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.54. - Articulation. 
(a) ?Wall plane. Building facades should incorporate breaks in the wall plane to provide massing and 
articulation. No single wall plane should exceed 60 feet in length on any exterior façade and should 
provide a minimum of a six-foot separation from abutting wall planes. 
(b) ?Height variations. Building heights should be articulated to express different building components, 
features and programmatic elements. Height variations among architectural elements should have 
an expression of no less than five feet in variation. 
(c) ?Roof articulations. All roof-mounted mechanical equipment such as air conditioners, elevators, 
transformers, antennas, satellite dishes and utility equipment shall be screened from contiguous 
properties and adjacent streets in a manner that is compatible with the architectural treatment of the 
principal structure. The city highly encourages the promotion of roof-top gardens in the planned 
redevelopment districts, especially for properties with rooftop visible from residential uses or for 
rooftops overlooking the public right-of-way. 
 
Planted Roof
 
Roof Garden
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.55. - Entrances, windows and storefronts. 
    Main entries are critical in their established relationships to the street. 
    Pedestrian entrances should be easily recognizable and oriented towards the street and not be 
obstructed from view by fences, landscaping or other visual barriers. The main front façade facing the 
street shall be equal to or better in appearance than entrances oriented to parking lots and/or service 
areas. 
 
•?Window and storefront articulations should utilize similar proportions as those within the 
surrounding context and should be primarily oriented towards the street. 
•?Multiple storefronts within a larger building shall have consistent material qualities and 
articulation and should relate to the detailing of the entire building. 
 
Display windows create visual interest 
•?A minimum of 50 percent of the front building façade on the ground level should be 
transparent, consisting of display windows or door openings to create visual interest. When 
possible, the bottom of transparent openings should be no higher than 36 inches above the 
sidewalk. Display windows used to satisfy these requirements should have a minimum vertical 
dimension of four feet and should be internally illuminated. This can only occur in locations 
assigned an AE flood zone. 
 
;hg;The side of this building faces a parking lot but retains the same finish and basic 
architectural details as the rest of the building. 
•?Building facades should provide architectural detail (e.g. eaves, columns, pilasters, cornices, 
windows and window surrounds, canopies, fascia, and roofs) that are proportionate with the 
building. The architectural features, materials, and the articulation of a façade of a building 
should be continued on all sides visible from a public street or parking lot, where feasible. 
•?Exterior burglar bars are prohibited. Security, roll down, and accordion shutters along with the 
associated hardware should be obscured by architectural features or awnings and should be 
finished to blend with the overall architectural character of the building and its surface materials. 
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.56. - Awnings, canopies, and balconies. 
•?Awnings, arcades, or canopies should be incorporated to provide pedestrian protection from 
the elements and reduce overall building heat gain. 
•?Awnings shall be attached to the building façades and cantilevered, if possible. Awnings shall 
not be supported by vertical elements within the right-of-way, except with approval of the city 
commission. 
•?Standard street level awnings shall be mounted so that the valance is at least ten feet above the 
sidewalk elevation. 
•?The use of adjustable louvers, euro shutters, and the like shall be considered substitutions for 
awnings or an arcade structure provided that the product: 
•?Provides pedestrian protection from the elements. 
•?Reduces overall building heat gain. 
•?Mounted at least ten feet above the walkway elevation. 
•?Attached to the building façade and not supported by vertical elements in the right-of-way.

    Service bays, mechanical equipment, dumpsters and delivery areas, to the greatest extent possible, 
shall be fully enclosed, screened or located within the interior of the building or along the alley. These 
areas shall not be visible from the right-of-way and shall not be visible from properties with adjacent 
commercial, residential or transient residential uses. 
 
Utility equipment is painted to blend with the 
building.
    Whenever possible, all exterior equipment shall be placed on the roofs and shall be screened by an 
architectural feature. Otherwise, the exterior equipment shall be placed on the side or rear of the building 
and screened. 
 
Screening of mechanical equipment on roof shall be at or above equipment height.
( Ord. No. 14-16, § 1, 1-6-15 ) 


Sec. 68-410.58. - Underground and above-ground utilities. 
    All on-site utilities including telephone, cable, and electrical systems shall be relocated underground.

between 108th Avenue and 107th Avenue and the parallel alley between 107th Avenue and 106th 
Avenue shall be interconnected to eliminate or minimize driveways along 108th Avenue and 106th 
Avenue respectively. 
(1) ?To ensure the effective use of these connections, the first property to redevelop shall be 
required to make an irrevocable offer of cross-access to the adjacent parcel prior to the city's 
issuance of a construction permit. The first property to redevelop must design and build the 
parking lot to accommodate cross-access. 
(2) ?When adjacent property owners seek permits, they will also be required to reciprocate with a 
similar cross-access agreement and then must complete the physical connection. 
(3) ?Individual property owners shall control all rights to the use of their own parking spaces, but 
may choose to allow wider use of these parking spaces through reciprocal arrangements with 
other parties. 
(c) ?Shared parking facilities. 
(1) ?Two or more non-residential uses located on the same or separate lots may provide for shared 
parking facilities, upon receiving the approval of the city manager or designee. The applicant 
shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager or designee that the uses are able to 
share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times (for 
example if one use operates during evenings or weekdays only). The applicant shall be required 
to demonstrate to the city manager or designee that the type of uses(s) indicates that the 
periods of usage will not overlap or be concurrent and that a reduction in the total number 
required off-street parking spaces is justified. The applicant shall submit documentation 
supporting the request for shared parking spaces that shall, at a minimum, include: 
a. ?The uses proposed to share parking and the number of parking spaces required for those 
uses;

description of the property upon which the uses are located and upon which the shared 
parking spaces are located; 
c. ?An analysis showing that peak parking times of uses occur at different times and that 
parking area(s) will have a sufficient number of parking spaces to meet the minimum 
anticipated demands of all uses sharing the joint parking area(s); and 
(2) ?The approval by the city manager or designee shall be documented as a shared parking 
agreement between the city and the applicant(s) in a form acceptable to the city attorney and 
which: 
a. ?Provides access to the shared parking spaces for all uses identified; 
b. ?Requires the processing of an amendment to the parking agreement for any substitution of 
uses not identified; 
c. ?Requires the owner(s) to bear the expense of recording the parking agreement and agree 
that the parking agreement shall bind their heirs, successors and assigns; 
d. ?Requires the parking agreement to be recorded in the public records of the clerk of the 
circuit court of the county prior to the issuance of the first building permit or certificate of 
occupancy for the project and may be voided by the city if other off-street facilities are 
provided in accordance with these regulations; and 
e. ?Requires the termination of the parking agreement in the event of a violation of any of the 
following; a provision of this Code, any condition of a related development approval, or any 
term of condition contained in the agreement, upon provision of reasonable notice to the 
property owner. 
(d) ?Driveway connections. 
(1) ?Properties fronting on 107th Avenue shall relocate existing driveways and parking spaces from 
107th Avenue to the parallel alley via 108th Avenue, 106th Avenue or 1st Street East when 
redevelopment of the site occurs. This provision will be waived during site plan review, should 
this requirement prohibit all reasonable access to a property. 
(2) ?When a driveway onto 107th Avenue is unavoidable, the driveway shall be shared with an 
adjoining property, if the adjoining property also has access only to 107th Avenue. If the 
adjoining property does not require the 107th Avenue driveway access, the driveway location 
shall be spaced as far as practical from other driveways or intersections. 
(3) ?Properties having frontage only on Gulf Boulevard, 108th Avenue, 106th Avenue, and 1st 
Street East may have driveways connected to their frontage, existing easements, and/or alleys. 
All Gulf Boulevard driveways shall be subject to FDOT approval. 
(4) ?Whenever possible, the driveway shall be shared with an adjoining property for lots abutting 
Boca Ciega Bay. This effort should reduce the number of driveway cuts along Gulf Boulevard. 
(e) ?Parking garages. 
(1) ?All levels of parking garages must be separated from primary streets by a liner building that 
provides usable building space at least 20 feet deep. 
a. ?Liner buildings must be one story or more in height. 
b. ?All ground levels of a parking structure facing a public right-of-way shall be lined with active 
permitted uses described in the zoning district. 
c. ?The façade of visible parking structures shall be designed to relate architecturally to 
surrounding buildings and contribute positively to the character of the zoning district. 
d. ?Planter boxes or other architectural features shall be used to add visual interest and break 
up the mass of the structure; and 
e. ?Ramps shall be internal to the structure and not visible from adjacent public rights-of-way. 
 
Liner Building Masking a Parking Structure
f. ?Enclosed parking levels shall have an exterior architectural treatment designed to be 
compatible with neighboring buildings and the area's context. Preferably exterior surface 
finishes of stucco, stone, or brick.

b. ?Access to 107th Avenue is not permitted except in unusual circumstances where no other 
access is feasible. This provision will be waived during site plan review, should this 
requirement prohibit all reasonable access to a property. 
(f) ?Required number of parking spaces in the PR-MU Core Zoning District and PR-MU Gulf Boulevard 
Zoning District. Some internal capture of vehicle trips results from the mixture of commercial uses in 
redevelopment areas. Generally, motorists come to the area and park once and visit several 
business locations within the downtown. This capture allows a reduced off-street parking 
requirement for comparable uses in conventional zoning districts. The minimum number of parking 
spaces provided by a principal use in the PR-MU Core Zoning District or the PR-MU Gulf Boulevard 
Zoning District shall be equal to 66 percent of the minimum off-street vehicle parking spaces 
established in the land development regulations. 
(g) ?Payment in-lieu-of parking. 
(1) ?In-lieu-of option. A developer may request to pay into the city in-lieu-of parking fund a sum of 
money for each nonresidential parking space that is not provided by the development project 
on-site or off-site. 
(2) ?Computation of cost to provide parking space. The initial fee shall be set with the establishment 
of a city payment in-lieu-of parking fund with the rate adjusted annually every October 1 
thereafter that reflects the changes in the consumer price index (CPI) or any other cost changes 
as determined by the city commission. 
(3) ?Payment in-lieu-of parking funds. Payment in-lieu-of parking funds will be deposited into the 
city payment in-lieu-of parking fund which shall be created by ordinance and may be amended

(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-261, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-452. - Lot width. 
    The minimum lot width of any lot shall be as indicated on the schedule of lot and bulk regulations. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-262, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-453. - Lot depth. 
    The minimum lot depth of any lot shall be as indicated on the schedule of lot and bulk regulations. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-263, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-454. - Intersection/driveway visibility. 
    At all street intersections and at the intersection of any street, driveway, or alley, no obstruction to 
vision (other than existing buildings posts or tree trunks with a maximum diameter of 12 inches, or 
existing buildings) between 30 inches and seven feet in height above the established grade of the street 
at the property line shall be erected or maintained on any lot within the triangle formed by the street,

alley frontage 50 feet distant from their point of street intersection or ten feet distant from their point of 
intersection with driveways and alleys. Existing trees must be cleared between 30 inches and seven feet. 
 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-264, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-455. - Reduction of lot area. 
    The area or dimension of any lot, yard, parking area or other space shall not be reduced to less than

reduced. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-265, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-456. - Maximum coverage. 
    Land coverage by principal and accessory buildings or structures on each lot shall not be greater

that required in the residential zoning district. In no case, however, shall the abutting side 
yard or abutting rear yard of the nonresidential zoning district be less than 15 feet. 
Screening requirements shall be required as set out in section 68-462. 
(2) ?Waterfront yard requirements. Every lot which abuts the Gulf of Mexico, public beach, Boca 
Ciega Bay or any of its inlets or basins, shall have, on the waterfront, a waterfront yard. Such 
waterfront yard is a required yard and shall not be utilized for any purpose other than 
specifically permitted in this Code. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-267, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 97-1, § 1(36-267), 1-14-97; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-

1½-inch cross sections may extend up to four feet in height. Decorative post caps may be installed 
on structural posts of the fence, but shall not extend more than ten inches above the top rail. 
(e) ?Right-of-way. 
(1) ?No walls or fences are permitted to be constructed within or upon any dedicated right-of-way. 
Railroad tie type planters not exceeding six inches in height, and mailboxes as excluded from 
the definition of "structure" in section 68-2, shall be permitted upon the untraveled portion within 
the city rights-of-way. 
(2) ?Vegetation and ornamental plantings are permitted upon the untraveled portion of the 
dedicated right-of-way beyond front yard setback areas so long as such vegetation or 
landscaping does not obstruct visibility. 
(3) ?A mailbox, as allowed and permitted for by this section, shall not be deemed a structure, and 
when permitted, shall be allowed to be placed in the right-of-way. Such mailbox shall be 
supported by nothing stronger than a single four-inch by four-inch wooden support post, or shall 
be designed to be of breakaway material, in order not to be a hazard to vehicles or pedestrians. 
Such mailbox shall be a total height of no more than 60 inches, a total width of no more than 20 
inches, and a total depth of no more than 32 inches. An applicant for any mailbox who desires 
such mailbox not to be considered a structure when such mailbox otherwise would be 
considered a structure, shall obtain a permit for such mailbox from the building department, and 
shall include with such application for permit a survey or sketch of the property, showing the 
location of such mailbox. Such mailbox shall be allowed only in locations where the mailbox 
would not obstruct visibility or traffic. 
(f) ?Temporary fences. The city manager may upon application being made grant a permit for the 
placement of a temporary construction fence to be erected during the period of construction and 
maintained until the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Such fence may be erected on the lot line 
of the property upon which construction is being maintained and which shall be reasonably designed 
to protect the public from intrusion upon the construction site. Under no circumstances shall a 
certificate of occupancy be issued until the temporary construction fence is removed.

Sec. 68-462. - Screening regulations. 
(a) ?Required screening. Where any nonresidential use directly abuts a residential zoning district or 
where a nonresidential use within a multifamily residential zoning district abuts a residential use or 
where a multifamily development abuts an RU-75 zoning district, it shall be screened from the 
adjoining residential zoning district or use in one of the following ways: 
(1) ?By a fence or wall at least five feet but not more than seven feet in height. Such fence or wall 
shall be located completely within the limits of the nonresidential lot and shall have equal 
architectural treatment on both sides; i.e. the side facing abutting properties, streets, etc., shall 
be finished. See also section 68-458. 
(2) ?By landscaping which is selected and arranged to form a visual screen between the 
nonresidential use and the residential zoning district or use from which it is to be screened. 
Such landscaping shall be mature plants having already attained a six-foot height and providing 
the necessary screening; however, a permanent fence to supplement the landscaping may be 
required. 
The provision of appropriate screening shall be an element of site plan review for sight barrier. 
(b) ?Maintenance. Any fences, walls or landscaping installed in accordance with this section shall be 
maintained in good order to achieve the objectives of this section. Failure to maintain fencing or to 
replace dead or diseased landscaping shall be considered a violation of this section.

or seawall line of any body of water except docks, davits and/or boat lifts. 
(b) ?Lot excavation. No person, firm or corporation shall strip, excavate or otherwise remove soil, sand, 
shale or gravel for sale or use and thereby create a borrow pit except in connection with the 
construction or alteration of a building permitted by the issuance of a building permit on such 
premises and excavation or grading incidental thereto. 
(c) ?Lot frontage. Every lot in every zoning district shall have the required frontage on a public or 
approved private street. An approved private street shall be a street constructed according to the 
requirements and specifications of the city building department and shall meet all engineering 
standards for public streets within the city. Upon complying with such requirements, the street shall 
become an approved private street after approval by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-273, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 02-06, § 6, 10-22-02; Ord. No. 03-04, § 6, 6-10-
03; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-464. - Satellite antenna regulation. 
(a) ?In all zoning districts, the following requirements apply: 
(1) ?Guy wires and satellite antennas shall be considered accessory structures and shall meet 
setbacks for accessory structures. 
(2) ?Satellite antennas shall be nonreflective and their color shall blend in with the surroundings. 
(3) ?The satellite antenna shall be installed and maintained in compliance with the requirements of 
the building code and electrical code as set out in chapter 64. A building permit shall be 
required prior to construction. In addition, all antennas must be grounded and must contain 
adequate surge protection devices for all electrical connections. 
(4) ?No advertising or signage of any type is permitted on a satellite antenna. 
(5) ?All satellite antenna installations must be certified with the seal of a professional engineer. 
(b) ?In residential zoning districts (RU-75 and RM-15) the following requirements shall apply: 
(1) ?Satellite antennas are permitted only within the rear or side yard buildable area for a principal 
or accessory structure. The location shall be at a fixed point on the ground or on a structure. 
Portable installation shall be prohibited. 
(2) ?No roof mounted antennas shall be permitted. 
(3) ?There shall be no more than one satellite antenna per lot/parcel. (Note: The intent of this rule is 
that each residential development, whether it be a single-family lot or apartment, or 
condominium complex, be allowed one satellite antenna. Technology is such that many 
receivers can be connected to one antenna. This allows everyone, in for example, an apartment 
complex, to watch the channel of their choice.) 
(4) ?The maximum satellite antenna diameter is 12 feet for mesh antennas and six feet for solid 
antennas. 
(5) ?The maximum satellite antenna height is 15 feet for a short pole installation. The minimum 
ground clearance is one foot. The maximum height of a long pole installation shall be 12 feet 
above the peak of the roof. A long pole installation (greater than nine-foot pole height) shall be 
no greater than three feet from the sidewall of a dwelling unit and braced to it. Only mesh type 
satellite antennas shall be permitted on long poles. In no event shall the height of any satellite 
antenna exceed the height requirement for structures in the zoning district. 
(c) ?In all other zoning districts (RFM-30, RFH-50 and CG) the following requirements shall apply: 
(1) ?Satellite antennas are permitted anywhere on a lot/parcel within the buildable area for a 
principal or accessory structure; however, not in the area to the front of the main structure. The 
location shall be at a fixed point on the ground or on a structure. 
(2) ?Satellite antennas are permitted on the roof provided that they do not exceed 13 feet in height, 
including base, from the roof. 
(3) ?There shall be no more than one satellite antenna per lot/parcel. 
(4) ?The maximum satellite antenna diameter is 12 feet for mesh antennas and six feet for solid 
antennas. 
(5) ?The maximum satellite antenna height is 15 feet if ground mounted (short pole installation). 
The minimum ground clearance is one foot. The maximum height of a long pole installation shall 
be 12 feet above the highest point of the roof. 
(6) ?Roof mounted satellite antennas are allowed, subject to the following requirements: 
a. ?Roof mounted satellite antennas and the roofs upon which they are placed must be 
designed, engineered and constructed in compliance with wind and structural loading 
requirements of the Florida Building Code as adopted in chapter 8. 
b. ?The maximum height of a roof mounted satellite antenna is 13 feet above the highest point 
of the roof. The minimum clearance from antenna to roof is one foot. 
(d) ?Except as provided in subsection (f), variances to these requirements can be requested through the 
planning and zoning board. 
(e) ?Satellite antennas legally in existence on the effective date of this section, and properly permitted by 
the city prior to that date shall be considered "grandfathered" and may remain unless relocated or 
replaced. A "grandfathered" antenna if replaced or relocated must comply with then current Code 
requirements and will lose its grandfathered status. Reconstruction or repair of an antenna which has 
been damaged to any extent of more than 75 percent of the current replacement value shall be 
considered replacement. 
(f) ?No variances may be granted after the effective date of this section which would allow satellite 
antennas in the front yard area. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-274, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-465. - Telecommunication towers and antennas. 
(a) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless 
telecommunication towers and antennas to accomplish the following goals: 
(1) ?Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; 
(2) ?Minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
(3) ?Encourage the use of existing structures as an alternative to new tower construction; 
(4) ?Encourage joint use of new or existing towers as a primary option rather than construction of 
additional single-use towers; 
(5) ?Encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas which minimizes the adverse 
visual impact of the towers and antennas; and 
(6) ?Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to 
the community quickly, effectively and efficiently. 
In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to the comprehensive plan, zoning 
map, existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of tower 
structures. 
(b) ?Applicability. Towers and antennas installed and maintained in accordance with this section are 
exempt from the height limitations for buildings and structures set forth elsewhere in this Code. The 
requirements set forth in this section shall govern the height of towers and antennas. The installation 
of an antenna on a building which is nonconforming in terms of current height limitations shall not be 
deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use. Amateur radio towers and antennas 
operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator are exempt from the provisions of 
this section. Towers and antennas located on city property are exempt from height limitations set 
forth elsewhere in this Code and are exempt from the requirements of this section, provided a lease 
or franchise agreement authorizing such tower or antenna has been approved by the city, or the 
tower or antenna is city-owned. Satellite antennas are considered an accessory use, are exempt 
from the requirements of this section and are governed by section 68-464. 
(c) ?Antennas. Antennas may be installed on existing structures, such as a building or other freestanding 
structure that is 50 feet in height or greater, provided the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the 
height of the existing structure, and provided that the existing building or structure is capable of 
supporting the additional load imposed by the addition of the antenna, properly anchored, designed 
and certified by a state registered professional structural engineer. The antenna and supporting 
electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely 
compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related 
equipment as virtually unobtrusive as possible. No lighting shall be permitted unless required by the 
FAA. If the supporting structure to which the antenna is affixed is removed for any reason by or at 
the direction of the city, the antenna owner shall remove and relocate the antenna to a permitted 
location at such owner's expense. The installation of antennas and supporting equipment will require 
a permit from the city's building/code enforcement department. An occupational license is required 
for every person or entity which is renting space on a supporting structure within the city for one or 
more wireless communication antennas. 
(d) ?Towers. In order to be eligible to obtain a permit to construct a tower, the proposed location must 
have a CG (Commercial), I (Institutional) or T/U (Transportation/Utility) zoning designation. In 
addition, no new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable 
satisfaction of the city manager that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does 
not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(1) ?An applicant shall submit information requested by the city manager related to the availability of 
suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to 
demonstrate that no existing structure or tower can accommodate the applicant's proposed 
antenna may consist of any of the following: 
a. ?No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet 
the applicant's engineering requirements. 
b. ?Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering 
requirements. 
c. ?Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the 
applicant's proposed antenna. 
d. ?The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with or would 
be interfered with by other antennas if placed on an existing tower or structure. 
e. ?The fees, cost or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing 
tower or structure exceed the cost of developing a new tower. 
f. ?The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers 
and structures unsuitable. 
(2) ?All applicants for new tower construction shall investigate city property for available space on 
an existing support structure or as a location for a new tower or other support structure. 
(3) ?Prior to the request for city approval, the applicant shall notify, by registered mail, return receipt 
requested, all other cellular and personal communication services providers doing business in 
the city of the proposed tower and solicit firms for colocation. The notice shall advise the other 
cellular and personal communication services that they have 30 days to respond to the letter. 
(4) ?The owner/operator of any proposed tower shall enter into an agreement with the city which 
requires that the owner/operator of the proposed tower will honor all reasonably and technically 
feasible requests for shared use of tower. Each year the owner/operator shall notify the city of 
the extent of the tower's use and identify the users of the tower. 
(e) ?Height restrictions and design criteria for towers. Upon receipt of a completed application, the city 
manager shall have 20 business days in which to review the evidence submitted and render a written 
decision regarding need for the construction of a new tower. Once the city manager has recognized 
the need for a tower, the plans for the tower and tower site shall comply with the following: 
(1) ?Single user towers shall not exceed 90 feet in height. Towers for two users shall not exceed 
120 feet in height. Towers designed for three or more users shall not exceed 150 feet in height. 
(2) ?Towers and supporting structures shall maintain a galvanized finish or, subject to any 
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual 
obtrusiveness. 
(3) ?Towers shall be set back from abutting existing residential uses, a distance equal to the height 
of the tower. 
(4) ?Tower guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum setback requirements as set 
forth in this Code for the particular zoning district. 
(5) ?Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be 
equipped with an anticlimbing device. 
(6) ?The perimeter of the tower site shall contain landscaping that will blend them into the natural 
setting and surrounding buildings, consisting of vegetative buffer or native plants that are no 
less than four feet wide and four feet height planted at three feet on center. 
(7) ?No tower shall be used for advertising of any type, and the placement of signs, other than 
warning signs, is strictly prohibited. 
(f) ?Federal requirements and safety standards. 
(1) ?All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, 
the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with authority to regulate towers and 
antennas. If such standards are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by 
this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards 
and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless 
a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to 
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall 
constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(2) ?Towers and antennas shall be constructed, installed and maintained in accordance with 
chapter 64 and other applicable codes and standards adopted by the city. In addition, the tower 
and antenna must meet the standards set forth by the Electronic Industries Association, 
amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the city concludes that the structural integrity of 
a tower or antenna constitutes a danger to persons or property, the owner of the tower or 
antenna shall be given notice of the condition and shall have 30 days to bring such tower or 
antenna into compliance and in accordance with such standards set forth in the applicable 
codes. Failure to bring such tower or antenna into compliance within 30 days shall constitute 
grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(g) ?Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower which is not operated for a 
period of 12 consecutive months shall be considered abandoned. Upon written demand by the city, 
the owner of an abandoned antenna or tower shall remove such antenna or tower within 60 days. 
Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this Code. Upon notification to remove an antenna or 
tower, any previously granted variances shall terminate. 
(h) ?Variance. The city commission shall have power and authority to grant variance to this section. In 
the event an applicant for a tower is required to apply for a variance to this section or another related 
section of this Code, in addition to the variance criteria set forth in section 70-221, the following 
criteria shall be used: 
The variance, if granted will result in a shared use, and thereby ultimately reduce the number of 
towers necessary to provide telecommunication service within the city. 
(i) ?Appeals. The applicant may appeal a decision by the city manager that a tower is not necessary, 
directly to the city commission. The applicant shall notify the city clerk in writing of the appeal, and a 
hearing that shall be held at the next available regular commission meeting. The city commission 
shall conduct a quasijudicial de novo hearing and base its decision upon competent substantial 
evidence. The criteria for the decision shall be the criteria set forth in section 68-481. 
(Ord. No. 97-4, § 9, 4-22-97; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-466. - Lighting. 
(a) ?Applicability. All outside lighting, (except street lighting), lamps, bulbs, lights, dock lighting, and 
security lighting producing artificial light from all single-family, multifamily, retail, office, tourist trade, 
and other land uses which shine or reflect light onto or into neighboring properties or residences so 
as to annoy or disturb the persons inhabiting such neighboring residences is hereby declared to be a 
nuisance and is unlawful and prohibited. All exterior lighting shall be installed in such a manner and 
shielded that the cone of light shall fall, within the perimeter of the property, and where applicable, 
landward of the coastal construction control line. 
    All premises shall meet the provisions of this section, unless due to the location of the site, these 
provisions will be in conflict with Chapter 72 Resources, Vegetation and Environmentally Sensitive Lands, 
Article V, Lighting Standards for Properties Abutting Public Beaches and/or Along the Gulf of Mexico, or 
exempted below: 
(1) ?Premises lawfully existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is 
derived. 
(2) ?Buildings and/or improved premises lawfully existing as of the effective date of this section, 
may be renovated or repaired without modifying outdoor lighting in conformance with this 
section, provided any increase in gross floor area of the building or the impervious area of the 
site is less than ten percent or 2,000 square feet, whichever is less. 
(3) ?Buildings and/or improved premises lawfully existing as of the effective date of this section that 
are enlarged by ten percent or 2,000 square feet more, in gross floor area or impervious area 
on the site, whichever is less, shall comply with outdoor lighting standards as specified in this 
section. 
(b) ?Prohibited light fixtures and light sources. The following light fixtures and sources shall not be used 
where the source of the direct light emitted is visible from adjacent lots: 
 
Cobra-head-type fixture with a drop lens
(1) ?Cobra-head-type fixtures having drop lenses or refractors which house other than incandescent 
sources; and 
(2) ?Searchlights and other high-intensity narrow-beam fixtures, except in conjunction with an 
approved special event or temporary use permit. 
(c) ?Design requirements. Outdoor lighting shall primarily be used to provide safety, while secondarily 
accenting key architectural elements and to emphasize landscape features. Light fixtures shall be 
designed as an integral design element that complements the design of the project. This may be 
accomplished through style, material or color. All lighting fixtures designed or placed to illuminate 
any portion of a site shall meet the following requirements: 
    Any state-of-the-art technology shall be taken into consideration that is consistent with the intent of 
this section, as new lighting technology develops that is useful in reducing light above the horizontal 
plane. 
(1) ?Fixture (luminaire). The light source shall be concealed and shall not be visible from any street 
right-of-way or adjacent properties. In order to direct light downward and minimize the amount 
of light spill into the night sky and onto adjacent properties or waterways, all lighting fixtures 
shall be cutoff fixtures. 
(2) ?Mounting. Fixtures shall be mounted in such a manner that the cone of light is contained on-
site and does not cross any property line of the site. 
(3) ?Limit lighting to period of activity. The use of sensor technologies, timers or other means to 
activate lighting during times when it will be needed is encouraged to conserve energy, provide 
safety and promote compatibility between different land uses. 
(d) ?Specific lighting. 
(1) ?Security lighting. 
a. ?Building-mounted security light fixtures such as wall packs shall not project above the roof 
line or parapet wall of the building and shall be shielded. 
b. ?Security fixtures shall not be substituted for parking area or walkway lighting and shall be 
restricted to loading, storage, service and similar locations. 
(2) ?Accent lighting. Only lighting used to accent architectural features, landscaping or art may be 
directed upward, provided that the fixture shall be located, aimed or shielded to minimize light 
spill into the night sky. 
 
Canopy Area Lighting
(3) ?Canopy area lighting. All development that incorporates a canopy area over fuel sales, 
automated teller machines or similar installations shall use a cutoff that provides a shielded light 
distribution. 
(4) ?Entrances to mixed use building types. All entrances to mixed use building types, and all 
entrances in apartment building types containing more than four units, shall be adequately 
lighted to ensure the safety of persons and the security of the building. 
(5) ?Commercial, hotel/motel and multi-family parking area lighting. All commercial, hotel/motel and 
multi-family parking areas shall be full cutoff. Light levels shall be a minimum of one initial foot 
candles of illumination throughout the parking lot. The maximum to minimum foot candle ratio 
shall not exceed 15 to one. All parking areas shall be required to provide lighting consistent with 
the design requirement of this section during nighttime hours of operation. 
(6) ?Excessive illumination. 
a. ?Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates and substantially interferes with the 
use or enjoyment of any other property shall be prohibited. Lighting unnecessarily 
illuminates another lot if it exceeds the requirements of this section. 
b. ?Lighting shall not be oriented so as to direct glare or excessive illumination onto streets in a 
manner that may distract or interfere with the vision of either drivers or pedestrians. 
(7) ?Beach lighting. No artificial public or private light source shall illuminate where it may deter 
adult female sea turtles from nesting or disorient hatchlings to the Gulf of Mexico during May 1 
— October 31. Refer to Chapter 72 Resources, Vegetation and Environmentally Sensitive

Sec. 68-484. - Accessory uses in motels or hotels. 
(a) ?Incidental services used in connection with either motels or hotels, including cigar and candy

(1) ?At least 50 hotel/motel units shall be contained within the building group. 
(2) ?Not more than ten percent of the total floor area within the buildings shall be so used. 
(3) ?All such incidental services shall be situated within the principal building. 
(b) ?Incidental services in conjunction with small hotels or motels of less than 50 units are permitted as 
an accessory use, provided the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(1) ?Such incidental services shall be related to the needs of motel or hotel guests and may include

Sec. 68-486. - Off-street parking. 
    The purpose of this section is to ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking areas. 
Furthermore, it is the intent to avoid urban congestion on public streets to protect the level of service and 
capacity of existing streets to avoid unnecessary conflicts between pedestrian and vehicles and to 
promote the general health, safety, and public welfare. These regulations shall apply to all off-street 
parking areas, including driveways for single-family and duplex dwellings, established within the city. Any 
plans for re-striping an existing off-street parking area or modifying the number of parking spaces shall be 
approved by either the planning and zoning board or the city manager or designee as required by the 
land development regulations upon the submittal of a parking plan which complies with the land 
development regulations. 
(a) ?Number and description of parking spaces required. Proper parking spaces shall be provided 
at the time of the construction of any main building or structure, or at any time any main building 
or structure is increased in occupant capacity, or at the time any use or occupancy of an 
existing building is changed to a use or occupancy which increases the requirements for off-
street parking facilities. Off-street parking lots may be allowed as provided for in chapter 68, 
article VI, Zoning district regulations (see the illustrative parking use table in section 68-486(q). 
Such parking lots shall be subject to site plan review and shall adhere to all applicable land 
development regulations. Parking areas shall be surfaced by a dust free paving material such 
as asphalt, bitumen, concrete, turf block or other similar materials except for that portion of the 
parking area abutting the Gulf of Mexico or public beach. With the exception of single-family and 
two-family dwellings, parking lots shall have each parking space and aisle marked. All required 
parking spaces shall be located at grade level or above. The number of parking spaces required 
is specified in the following schedule of off-street parking requirements:

(b) ?Size and access. 
(1) ?All uses, except single-family. For all uses, except single-family and approved stacked 
parking, an off-street parking space shall consist of a parking space having minimum 
dimensions as required in the diagram for regular and compact car parking, or nine feet in 
width by 22 feet in length for the parallel parking of each automobile, exclusive of access 
drives or aisles thereto. The parking plan must be so arranged that each automobile may 
be placed and removed from the parking space assigned thereto and taken to and from the 
property without the necessity of moving any other automobile to complete the maneuver, 
except for a licensed and authorized rental car agency. Street and/or sidewalk areas may 
not be used for off-street parking purposes as herein defined. Individual ingress and egress 
drives extending across the public sidewalks and curbs and connecting the off-street 
parking spaces to the public street areas shall not exceed a minimum of 12 feet and a 
maximum of 15 feet for a one-way drive and a minimum of 24 feet and a maximum of 30 
feet for a two-way drive. The design, number and placement of such drives is subject to 
site plan approval by the city before being constructed. Two or more owners and operators 
of commercial buildings or uses of the same type in the same zoning district requiring off-
street parking facilities may take collective provision for such ingress and egress facilities 
provided that the combined facility is compatible with the zoning being served. 
Exception: Stacked parking may be permitted for businesses in conjunction with legal off-
street parking uses as provided for in chapter 68, article VI, Zoning district regulations (see 
the illustrative parking use table in section 68-486(q) in accordance with the following 
conditions: 
a. ?An application for special exception to the planning and zoning board shall be 
submitted for review and approval. 
b. ?The application shall reflect that all parties acknowledge that the stacked parking 
facility is to be used only by the permitted business and is not currently required 
parking for any other use. 
c. ?Lots approved for stacked parking shall not be required to have each parking space 
and aisle marked unless such lot will be used for other than stacked parking. 
(2) ?Single-family uses. For single-family uses, off-street parking areas shall be a minimum of 
324 square feet (equivalent to two nine-foot by 18-foot spaces). 
(3) ?Plan approval; permits required. The plan for ingress and egress to and from the off-street 
parking areas shall be subject to the approval of the city. No curbs or sidewalks may be cut 
or altered in any manner without a permit from the city and all other applicable county or 
state agencies. 
(4) ?Variances. Any variance to alter the number or size of parking requirements in any zoning 
district may only be granted pursuant to section 70-221. 
(5) ?Regular car parking. Regular car parking shall meet the following minimum dimensions:

(c) ?Location of parking spaces. Parking spaces for all uses and structures which are provided as 
required parking in conformance with the schedule of parking, off-street and other applicable 
provisions shall be located on the same lot, and have the same zoning district, as the principal 
use or structure they are intended to serve unless otherwise allowed by article VI, Zoning district 
regulations. Those businesses participating in the downtown parking agreement or in a shared 
parking agreement identified in this section of the land development regulations may be 
exempted from the same lot requirements of this section per the specific agreement. 
(d) ?Parking or storage of rental vehicles. Parking or storage of rental vehicles in connection with a 
licensed and authorized rental car agency shall be located on the same lot or parcel of property 
as the licensed office of the rental car agency or such lot or parcel shall be contiguous to the lot 
or parcel on which the main rental agency or office is located. The storage of rental cars does 
not require standard parking spaces. 
(e) ?Handicapped parking. Handicapped parking shall meet the requirements of the State 
Handicapped Access Code, F.S. § 553.501 et seq. 
(f) ?Utilization of parking structures. When off-street parking facilities are located within a separate 
parking structure, the following conditions and restrictions shall apply: 
(1) ?The structure shall conform to all lot, yard and bulk requirements of the zoning district in 
which it is located. 
(2) ?The parking facilities shall be designed so as to conform to all other provisions of this 
chapter and all other ordinances of the city. 
(3) ?Parking structures shall be architecturally compatible with abutting structures and shall be 
screened with ornamental grillwork, artwork, or similar architectural features. 
(4) ?Vehicular access shall be designed in a manner that minimizes disruption to pedestrian 
corridors and the streetscape. 
(5) ?All lighting relating to parking structures shall conform with section 68-466 and sections 
72-161 through 72-164. 
This subsection shall not apply to or be construed to prohibit the construction of freestanding 
carports or garages as accessory structures to single-family or two-family residential dwellings. 
Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the installation of a fully automatic parking facility 
in which the placement and removal of automobiles are accomplished wholly by machinery. 
However, such mechanism shall be completely shielded from public view. 
(g) ?Utilization of yards. 
(1) ?In all residential zoning districts, required parking spaces for single-family and two-family 
dwellings may be permitted in any setback areas or yards, except in a waterfront yard, and 
shall be counted as meeting off-street parking requirements, except that within a required 
front yard all parking shall be located in a driveway or turnaround. 
(2) ?In all zoning districts, for all other permitted uses, approved permitted uses with site plan 
review or approved special exception uses, required front, side or rear yards may be used 
for off-street parking except as limited herein. A maximum of 80 percent of a required front 
yard may be used for off-street parking. All parking areas shall have each parking space 
and aisle marked and shall be landscaped in conformance with the paved area landscape 
requirements in chapter 72, article II. 
(3) ?In all zoning districts, parking area surfaces shall not extend closer than three feet from 
any abutting property line. 
(4) ?All parking spaces shall be considered impervious for the purpose of calculating required 
pervious area pursuant to section 68-226. 
(h) ?Shared parking. Parking facilities may be used jointly with parking facilities for other uses when 
operations are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use vary. 
Requests for the use of shared parking are subject to the approval of the city manager and must 
meet the following conditions: 
(1) ?The applicant must demonstrate to the city manager's satisfaction that substantial conflict 
shall not exist in the principal hours or periods of peak demand for the uses for which the 
joint use is proposed. 
(2) ?The number of parking stalls which may be credited against the requirements for the 
structures or uses involved shall not exceed the number of parking stalls reasonably 
anticipated to be available during different hours of operation. 
(3) ?Parking facilities designated for joint use should not be located further than 600 feet from 
any structure of use served. 
(4) ?A written agreement shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the city attorney and executed by 
all parties concerned assuring the continued availability of the number of stalls designated 
for joint use. 
(5) ?The applicant shall post a sign at the business indicating the location of the shared 
parking facility for the customer's benefit in the event overflow parking is needed. 
(i) ?Bicycle parking. Bicycles are a clean, energy-efficient, alternative means of transportation, 
especially for those whose access to motorized transportation is limited. Therefore, it is the 
policy of the city to encourage the use of bicycles by requiring that development and 
redevelopment provide adequate and properly located bicycle parking facilities, in accordance 
with the following standards: 
(1) ?Each commercial, institutional, or recreational development or redevelopment which 
requires site plan approval shall provide off-street bicycle parking, sufficient to park at least 
five bicycles, for each freestanding building. In addition, the provision of additional area 
sufficient to park at least five additional bicycles shall qualify the development for a parking 
credit of one parking space. The planning and zoning board shall have the option of 
increasing this requirement as a condition of site plan approval, based upon the type and 
characteristics of the specific development under review. Only the following type(s) of 
development shall be exempt from this requirement: 
a. ?Freestanding uses which require the presence of motor vehicles, such as automobile 
or motorcycle repair shops, filling stations, body repair shops, and similar uses, 
provided, however, that should the occupancy of a building change to a non-exempt 
use, bicycle parking facilities may be required as a condition of reoccupancy. 
Shopping centers and other multiple-tenant developments which may contain the 
above uses are not exempted. 
(2) ?The following design standards shall apply to all bicycle parking facilities: 
a. ?Bicycle parking facilities shall be separated from automobile parking, conveniently 
located near the main entrance of a building without obstructing pedestrian walkways, 
and sufficiently visible to minimize the potential for theft or vandalism. 
b. ?Bicycle parking facilities shall be placed over paved or otherwise stabilized surfaces 
not subject to erosion or rutting. 
c. ?Each bicycle parking space shall provide sufficient area to store a full-sized bicycle, 
and a rack or other means to support and lock the bicycle in a stable, upright position 
without damage to wheels, frame, or components. 
(j) ?Motorcycle/scooter parking. Motorcycle and scooter parking may substitute for required parking 
spaces, for non-residential uses. Existing parking may be converted to take advantage of this 
provision for non-residential uses. 
(1) ?Ratios. Motorcycle and scooter parking may substitute for up to five automobile spaces or 
five percent of the required parking spaces, whichever is less. For every four motorcycle or 
scooter parking spaces provides, the automobile parking requirement is reduced by two 
spaces. 
(2) ?Identification. Motorcycle and scooter parking spaces must be identified or designated. 
(k) ?[Remote parking.] Remote parking may be allowed as provided for in article VI, Zoning district

utilizing a remote parking facility shall provide evidence of the owner's right to use the remote 
parking area either by license, deed, easement, or by long term lease. Such remote parking 
facility must be located within the city and must be more than 600 feet in distance of the site 
serving the principal use and shall be measured from the nearest point of the principal use lot 
line to an entrance to the remote parking facility. Such separated parking areas shall be usable 
without causing unreasonable traffic congestion, detriment to any residential neighborhood, or 
hazard to pedestrians. Such remote parking facilities shall be subject to site plan review and 
shall be upgraded to meet current city codes for required parking and landscaping as required 
by chapter 72, article II, of the land development regulations for vehicular use areas. Staff or the 
planning and zoning board as applicable shall consider specific restrictions pertaining to hours 
of operation, noise, and lighting among other considerations in the review of such remote 
parking request. In addition, the owner of the principal use utilizing the remote parking facility 
shall have a transportation plan to shuttle people between the principal use and the remote 
parking facility. 
(l) ?[Valet parking.] Valet parking is a service which may be allowed in conjunction with legal off-
street parking uses citywide as provided for in article VI, Zoning district regulations (see the 
illustrative parking use table in section 68-486(q). This service constitutes a manner of use 
wherein administrative review is appropriate and may also allow the stacking of parking in the 
configuration outlined in section 68-486(b)(1). The following criteria shall apply: 
(1) ?Such use receives administrative approval from the city manager or designee. 
(2) ?At a minimum, all such valet parking facilities shall be subject to in-house site plan review. 
Required upgrades to meet required city codes pertaining to parking and landscaping 
vehicular use areas may also require site plan review by the planning and zoning board 
unless exempted by section 70-33. 
(3) ?The city manager or designee may consider specific restrictions pertaining to hours of 
operation, noise, and lighting among other considerations in the review of such off-site

(b) ?The letter shall reflect that all parties acknowledge that the stacked parking area is to 
be used only by the permitted business and is not currently required parking for any 
other use. 
(c) ?Parking areas approved for stacked parking shall not be required to have each

(m) ?Temporary parking review and permit. The following types of temporary parking facilities may 
be allowed as provided for in article VI, Zoning district regulations (see the illustrative parking 
use table in section 68-486(r). The power and authority to grant special exceptions and related 
site plan review for temporary parking will be solely within the jurisdiction of the city commission. 
(1) ?Temporary, non-recurring parking may be allowed as provided for in article VI, Zoning 
district regulations (see the illustrative parking use table in section 68-486(r) for a 
maximum of 90 days. Temporary parking shall not be permitted in the RU-75 or RM-15 
zoning districts.

approval. 
2. ?Included but not limited to any adverse impacts to such parking, changes in the 
land development regulations affecting the parking, crime statistics for such

j. ?Lot coverage. The maximum lot coverage and impervious surface ratio shall apply to the 
established and specific zoning district in which the townhouse development project is 
proposed. The maximum lot coverage requirement and the maximum impervious surface 
ratio shall apply to the townhouse development, not to an individual townhouse lot. 
k. ?Each townhouse unit shall have an individual identity from the neighboring unit to establish 
as a separate unit. This may be achieved by at least one of the criteria below: 
1. ?Varying building unit height; 
2. ?Varying building unit forms; 
3. ?Varying roof pitch and pitch directions; 
4. ?Addition or deletion of patio and patio walls; 
5. ?Staggering of exterior walls; or 
6. ?Any another type of architectural design that gives an individual identity. 
l. ?Parking. There shall be a minimum of two parking spaces per townhouse or townhouse unit. 
(2) ?Utilities and services. 
a. ?Each townhouse shall be independently served by separate potable water, sanitary sewer, 
electric power and other utility services hereinafter referred to as "infrastructure", to ensure 
each are individual dwelling units. 
b. ?No townhouse shall be in any way dependent upon services or utility lines located within 
another townhouse, except as may be installed in public easements. 
c. ?All townhouses must be connected to public infrastructure and all utility lines in a 
townhouse development site shall be placed underground per section 68-514 "Placement 
of utilities." 
d. ?All townhouse developments shall have proper and adequate access for public safety 
purposes and access to services, areas to provide for solid waste collection, and for the 
other necessary services that shall be provided. 
(3) ?Subdivision approval. Prior to a building permit being issued for construction, a subdivision plat 
shall be recorded with the county clerk of the circuit court. The plat of the townhouse 
development shall be developed in accordance with the standards and procedures set out in the 
city's land development regulations, chapter 74 and pursuant to F.S. ch. 177.

Sec. 68-491. - Same—Conversions. 
(a) ?All conversions of single-family dwellings in multifamily residential zoning districts shall comply with 
off-street parking requirements and each dwelling unit shall have adequate light, air, heating and 
plumbing facilities. All density and lot area requirements for the converted structure within the zoning 
district in which it is located shall be complied with; provided however, that each converted dwelling 
unit shall have at least 500 square feet of floor area. 
(b) ?Prior to the conversion of multifamily or motel/hotel units to condominium units, the owner shall 
submit a copy of his proposed condominium documents, as required under the provisions of state 
law, to the city for review. The conversion, in all respects shall comply with all city ordinances for the 
converted structure. 
(c) ?No owner, occupant or user of any structure or dwelling shall alter or amend the use of such 
structure or dwelling from that which was authorized and permitted at the time it was originally 
constructed or permitted without first obtaining written approval for such change in use from the city 
clerk. No such approval shall be granted for any change of use which would render the structure or 
dwelling nonconforming under the zoning regulations in effect at the time application is made for 
approval.

Sec. 68-492. - Religious institution uses, and private clubs, and other assembly uses. 
    Applications for religious institution uses, private clubs, and other assembly uses, either as a 
permitted use or a special exception use, shall require the submission of a site development plan in 
accordance with the site plan review requirements in article II of chapter 70. The following regulations 
shall be utilized as guidelines in reviewing the proposed development: 
(1) ?Lot and bulk. Such development should not exceed the height and bulk restrictions as provided 
for in article VI. 
(2) ?Traffic access. All proposed site traffic accessways are adequate, but not excessive in number, 
adequate in width, alignment and visibility and so located so as not to be a detriment to 
surrounding properties. 
(3) ?Circulation and parking. The interior circulation system is adequate to serve the needs of the 
development and that all required parking is provided and easily accessible. 
(4) ?Proper landscaping. The proposed site is properly landscaped, the purpose of which is to 
further enhance the natural qualities of the land. As provided elsewhere in this chapter, proper 
screening and buffer zones may be required. 
(5) ?Secondary and/or accessory uses. The allowance of secondary and/or accessory uses shall be 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis consistent with the allowable zoning district regulations and 
adherence to site plan review requirements. Any additional usage shall meet the land 
development regulations requirements and provide for their respective proportion of density and 
intensity requirements. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-297, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 11-10, § 8, 8-2-11; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-493. - Home occupations. 
    An occupation may be conducted in a dwelling unit or residence, provided: 
(1) ?No person shall be employed on the premises other than members of the immediate family 
residing on the premises. 
(2) ?The use of the dwelling unit or residence for home occupations shall be clearly incidental and 
secondary to its use for residential purposes. No more than one room within the dwelling unit 
shall be used to conduct a home occupation, provided the area of that room does not exceed 20 
percent of the total living area of the dwelling unit or residence. No more than five percent of 
that room shall be used for storage of commodities related to the home occupation. No outside 
display, storage or use of land is permitted. 
(3) ?There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises as a result of 
such occupation with the exception of a sign as provided in the sign requirements in chapter 73. 
(4) ?No home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory building or attached garage. 
(5) ?No mechanical equipment shall be used or stored on the premises except such that is normally 
used for purely domestic or household purposes; nor shall it create noise, vibration, glare, 
fumes, odors or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses outside the dwelling unit. 
In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates 
visual or audio interference in any radio or television sets off the premises or causes fluctuation 
in line voltage. 
(6) ?No retail or wholesale sales on the premises shall be permitted, not including telephone mail 
order sales. 
(7) ?No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater volume than would normally 
be expected in the neighborhood. 
(8) ?A home occupation shall not be construed to include, among other uses, personal services 
such as massage, cosmetology, barbershops, beauty parlors, tea rooms, food processing for 
sale, kennels, animal grooming, radio and television repair, furniture refinishing or building, 
cabinet making, boat building, marine charter or towing service, auto servicing or rebuilding and 
repair for others, metal fabrication or cutting employing welding or cutting torches. 
(9) ?No more than one vehicle related to the home occupation shall be permitted upon the 
premises. Such vehicle must be 20 feet or less in overall length and must be parked off any 
public right-of-way. All exterior storage of cargo, equipment or other materials on such vehicle 
shall be shielded from view at all times when such vehicle is located on a residential lot. 
(10) ?A home occupation that is solely used for purposes of receiving phone calls, mail and keeping 
business records in connection with any profession or occupation, shall be known as an 
address of convenience. 
(11) ?The city manager or his designee shall determine whether the home occupation meets the 
established criteria as set out in subsections (1) through (10). The determination may be 
appealed to the planning and zoning board. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-298, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 68-494. - Condo-hotels, hotels and motels, and transient segmented uses (such as time share and 
fractional interests). 
    The city recognizes that the condo-hotel is a hybrid form of ownership of the traditional hotel/motel 
concept. It must be recognized that condo-hotel is considered to be a transient hotel/motel use, and not a 
residential use. Additionally, segmented uses, such as time share and fractional interests, are often 
transient in nature and must also be regulated as a transient use rather than a residential use. Exceptions 
to the general transient character of segmented uses can be found under the definition of "dwelling 
tourist" in section 68-2. It is the intent of this regulation to ensure that condo-hotels are operated and 
governed in substantially the same manner as conventional hotels/motels. It is also the intent of this 
section to regulate all segmented uses not exempted under the definition of "dwelling, tourist" to be 
operated and governed in substantially the same manner as conventional hotels/motels. Further, this 
zoning regulation is designed to protect and preserve the density requirements mandated in zoning 
districts where traditional hotels and motels are allowed, as well as preserving future transient 
accommodations on the open market, and made available to the general public and tourists. The 
operation of condo-hotels, hotels and motels, and transient segmented uses is strictly a commercial 
activity and is inconsistent with residential use. Transient and business related activities have different 
impacts on governmental facilities and infrastructure (e.g., density, traffic, parking, schools). As such, this 
regulation is to ensure that the use and operation of condo-hotels, hotels and motels, and segmented 
uses remain an exclusively commercial enterprise, and not a residential use. 
    In addition to any existing regulations relating to hotel/motel development found elsewhere in the 
land development regulations, the following criteria shall apply to all condo-hotels, hotels and motels, and 
transient segmented uses except where noted: 
(1) ?All units in a condo-hotel, hotel or motel, or transient segmented use shall be considered 
transient accommodation units and must be made available as rentals on a continual daily, 
weekly or monthly basis. If the occupancy of any such unit does not change more frequently 
than six times or more in any continuous 12-month period, then a rebuttable presumption shall 
arise that the unit is not being used for transient accommodations. 
(2) ?Proper licensing will be required of all transient accommodation units through all applicable 
agencies that license hotels prior to any certificate of occupancy being issued. All licenses must 
be kept current. 
(3) ?A reservation system shall be required as an integral part of the transient accommodation 
facility for the rental of units. 
(4) ?There shall be a lobby/front desk area that is internally oriented and must be operated as a 
typical hotel/motel lobby/front desk area would be operated. 
(5) ?All units shall be subject to all applicable tourist tax collections, when rented. 
(6) ?Transient accommodation units shall not be used for homesteading purposes or home 
occupational licensing. 
(7) ?Notwithstanding subsection (12), one unit may be used on a full-time basis by a resident 
manager(s), and, if applicable, subject to the governance of the condominium or transient 
segmented use association. 
(8) ?All transient accommodation units, except the resident manager unit, must be included in the 
inventory of units that are available for rent. 
(9) ?A condo-hotel or transient segmented use may be allowed in any district where a hotel or motel 
is allowed. 
(10) ?Annual occupational licenses for each business operating a condo-hotel unit or transient 
segmented use shall be required for each such unit from the city, and for each business 
operating a hotel/motel facility, whichever is applicable. 
(11) ?All transient accommodation facilities must have sufficient signage viewable by the general 
public designating the use as a hotel, motel, or transient accommodation. 
(12) ?Owner-occupation. Units in a condo-hotel, hotel or motel or segmented use facility, may not 
be occupied by their owner(s) for more than a total of 90 days in any consecutive 12-month 
period. 
(13) ?The books and records of the condo-hotel, hotel or motel, or transient segmented use 
pertaining to the rentals of each unit in the transient accommodation facility shall be open for 
inspection by authorized representatives of the city, upon reasonable notice, in order to confirm 
compliance with these regulations as allowed by general law. 
(14) ?The city may require affidavits of compliance with this section from each condo-hotel unit 
owner, hotel/motel facility owner, or transient segmented use owner. 
(Ord. No. 05-09, § 3, 4-12-05; Ord. No. 06-02, § 1, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-495. - Minimum property standards. 
    The purpose of minimum property standards is to eliminate nuisances that detract from the public 
health and safety and aesthetic quality of the community. The following requirements are required as 
minimum property standards: 
(1) ?Nuisances. The exterior of the premises and of all structures shall be kept free of all nuisances, 
hazards to residents, occupants and pedestrians utilizing the premises, and free of unsanitary 
conditions in accordance with the following requirements: 
a. ?All premises shall be kept free of dead trees and shrubs, excessive brush and overgrowth, 
excavations, standing water not a component of an approved drainage system, loose 
overhanging objects, and the accumulation of trash, garbage, refuse, vegetation clippings 
and/or debris. 
b. ?The exterior of the structure including signs, screens and store fronts, shall be maintained 
in good repair, kept painted or have similar protective coating where necessary for 
appearance and preservation. 
c. ?All exterior surfaces shall be maintained free of broken glass, loose shingles, excessive 
paint peeling, excessive mildew, excessive corrosion or other conditions reflective of 
inadequate maintenance or deterioration. 
d. ?Metal roofs, including accessory structures, showing signs of decay or corrosion shall be 
maintained, painted or repaired in accordance with manufacturer specifications. 
(2) ?Turf maintenance and height of grass. The exterior areas of the premises, including yards, lots 
and public rights-of-way shall be maintained in a manner free from nuisances, hazards and 
other unsanitary conditions through the following requirements: 
a. ?All premises with overgrown grass over six inches high on all residential properties shall be 
considered excessive growth. 
b. ?Premises landscaped with lawns, hedges, and bushes edged/or trimmed shall be kept from 
becoming overgrown and unsightly. 
c. ?Lawns shall be kept in a condition reflective of reasonable care, with grass showing no 
excessive signs of neglect, discoloring and/or dead vegetative growth. 
d. ?Owners of private properties are responsible for the maintenance of vegetation, including 
weeds, grass and other plant materials in the established abutting right-of-way. 
e. ?It shall be unlawful to dispose of grass clippings, tree trimmings, and/or other vegetative 
materials in the right-of-way, street, alley or waterways. 
(3) ?Gravel lawns. The use and maintenance of gravel lawns shall conform to the following 
requirements: 
a. ?Gravel, rock, shell and similar materials lawns are allowed and shall be maintained free of 
weeds and be permeable. The installation of such material shall require a grounds 
improvement permit from the city to ensure permeability. 
(Ord. No. 07-01, § 2, 3-20-07; Ord. No. 12-01, § 2, 3-20-12; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ; Ord. No. 
17-02 , § 1, 6-20-17) 


Sec. 68-496. - Development agreements. 
    Pursuant to the authority granted the city by F.S. §§ 163.3220—163.3243, as amended (known as 
the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, hereinafter the "Act") the city may enter into 
a development agreement with any person(s) having a legal or equitable interest in real property located 
within the city. 
    A development agreement shall mean a written agreement between the city and a property owner(s) 
that identifies fees, dedications, exactions or other public improvements or construction controls that will 
be provided by the developer, and the land development regulations that will be applied by the city during 
the term of the agreement. 
(1) ?A development agreement may be entered into when one or more of the following exist: 
a. ?Where the development is proposed to be constructed with commitments to substantial 
public improvements being required in the development process. 
b. ?Where commitments to public improvements beyond those ordinarily required of similar 
development are desirable by reason of location, topography, or other characteristics of the 
property. 
c. ?Where it is desirable to provide incentives to coordinate developments with a specific plan. 
(2) ?Procedures and requirements for entering into a development agreement: 
a. ?Proposal for a development agreement may be made by any interested party at any time 
prior to the completion of approvals for development of the project. Such proposal shall be 
formulated with the applicant and the city manager. 
b. ?A proposed development agreement shall be adopted, amended, or revoked by following 
the procedures of the Act. At a minimum, the local planning agency and the city 
commission shall each hold a public hearing following the notification procedures set forth 
in the Act and section 70-12. 
c. ?Development agreements shall be adopted by ordinance and may be amended by 
ordinance with the mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or by their successors in 
interest. 
d. ?No development agreement shall be effective or be implemented by the city unless the 
city's comprehensive plan and plan amendments implementing or related to the agreement 
are in compliance with F.S. § 163.3184. 
(3) ?A development agreement shall include the following: 
a. ?A legal description of the land subject to agreement and the names of its legal and

DIVISION 4. - NONCONFORMING USES 


Sec. 68-511. - Continuation. 
(a) ?A use, building, or structure, lawfully in existence at the effective date of the article from which this 
chapter is derived which shall be rendered nonconforming with the adoption of the city 
comprehensive plan, the passage of the article from which this chapter is derived, or any applicable 
amendment thereto, shall be considered grandfathered and may be continued, except as otherwise 
provided in this division. 
(b) ?A use, building or structure is, for the purpose of this chapter, a nonconforming use if the use, 
building or any physical characteristics of such use or building is not in full compliance with all 
regulations of the zoning district in which it is situated. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 36-311, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 00-08, § 30, 1-9-01; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 68-512. - Regulation. 
    No existing building or premises devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, 
reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered, except when changed to a conforming use or when 
required to do so by law and as follows: 
(1) ?Restoration. Any nonconforming structure which has been damaged or made unsafe or 
unusable to an extent less than 50 percent of its fair market value may be restored or 
reconstructed for its intended use provided the floor area of such use, building or structure shall 
not exceed the floor area which existed prior to such damage. All repairs shall be substantially 
completed within one year after damages occur or such use shall not be rebuilt except as a 
conforming use. 
(2) ?Repairs. Normal maintenance, repair, and incidental alteration of a structure containing a 
nonconforming use is permitted, provided that it does not extend the area or volume of space 
occupied by the nonconforming use. It is the intent of these regulations to encourage the 
conservation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of existing residential land uses. Therefore, a 
building or other structure containing nonconforming residential uses may be altered in any way 
to improve interior livability; provided that no structural alterations shall be made which would 
increase the number of dwelling units. 
(3) ?Site alterations. Site alterations, including but not limited to off-street parking rearrangement or 
enlargement of nonbuilding recreational facilities of a nonconforming use are permitted, 
provided that the proposed alterations do not increase the degree of nonconformity. In order to 
encourage rehabilitation or redevelopment of an existing nonconforming use, the planning and 
zoning board may approve a site plan which includes an increase in gross floor area of up to ten 
percent of the existing gross floor area (not to exceed the maximum allowable under the 
property's designated zoning district), subject to a finding by the board that the overall degree of 
nonconformity on the site is significantly reduced and that additional adverse impacts will not be 
created. In conjunction with this site plan approval, the board may grant an exemption from 
variance requirements for any and all remaining nonconformities. These site plan and variance 
exemption provisions may be applied only once to any specific property. 
(4) ?Exception. Restoration, repairs and site alterations can be made to existing single-family 
dwellings in zoning districts which allow such single-family dwellings, provided that such 
restorations, repairs or site alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units, increase 
density, increase the degree of the nonconformity, or result in a different type of nonconformity 
from that which is already considered to be grandfathered. 
(5) ?Nonconforming density. Existing residential dwelling, tourist dwelling, and hotel/motel uses 
which are nonconforming as to density shall not require a variance to permit the otherwise 
allowable addition or alteration to the building or site, provided that the density is not increased. 
(6) ?Repair and reconstruction of existing commercial, residential, and hotel/motel structures and 
uses. 
a. ?Residential structures/uses and their permitted accessory uses are grandfathered in the 
RU-75, RM-15, RFM-30, RFH-50, and CG zoning districts. 
b. ?Hotel/motel structures/uses and their permitted accessory uses are grandfathered in the 
RFM-30, RFH-50, and CG zoning districts. 
c. ?In the event that any residential or hotel/motel structure is damaged or destroyed by a 
hurricane, tornado, fire, flood, wind, storm or other natural disaster, it can be repaired or 
reconstructed in a manner which guarantees that each unit and all permitted accessory 
uses can be restored to the same square footage which existed as of September 19, 1995. 
Repairs and reconstruction shall adhere to all flood management regulations in effect. In 
the event that such flood regulations require the elevation of a structure, the city shall 
permit the height of the structure to be increased the minimum necessary to accommodate 
the required flood elevation. If the repairs or reconstruction cannot be made in accordance 
with these Code provisions, the city shall grant the owners relief from such Code provisions 
to permit the grandfathered units and all existing legally permitted accessory uses to be 
restored without creating a greater nonconformity than existed prior to the disaster. 
d. ?Nothing contained in this section shall relieve the owner/developer of the obligation to 
restore the damaged structure in compliance with the building code as adopted in section 
64-1 and Life Safety Code as adopted in section 64-1. Nothing contained herein shall be 
construed to permit more dwelling units or an increase in square footage of the structure 
than existed prior to September 19, 1995. The burden of proof as to what existed prior to 
September 19, 1995, shall rest with the property owner based upon a site plan on file at 
city hall. If no site plan is presently on file, each property owner shall provide the city with a 
site plan, as-built surveys, or architecturally-sealed floor plans. The plans or surveys shall 
provide enough information to determine the existing legally permitted development on the 
site. Single-family and two-family structures are exempt from the site plan requirements. 
e. ?Commercial structures/uses and their permitted accessory uses are grandfathered in the 
RFM-30, RFH-50, and CG zoning districts.

(a) ?Abandonment. A nonconforming use not used for a period of six months or the change of use to a 
more restricted or conforming use for any period of time shall be considered an abandonment 
thereof and such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be revived. 
(b) ?Partial destruction. When a building has been destroyed by fire or other casualty or act of God to 
the extent of 50 percent or more of its fair market value and as a result has become unsafe or 
unusable, the use of such structure as a nonconforming use shall thereafter be terminated.

building official, such replacement shall result in an undue hardship being placed upon the owner of such 
structure.

vertical steel reinforcement equivalent in cross-sectional area to one #4 deformed 
reinforcing bar spaced at eight inches on center. Each slab shall have two #4 steel hairpins 
extending into the cap at minimum of three inches. 
c. ?The poured-in-place concrete cap shall not be less than 9½ inches in thickness, nor less 
than 16 inches in width. 
d. ?The cap shall contain continuous horizontal steel reinforcement equivalent in cross-
sectional area to four #4 deformed reinforcing bars. All splices shall be lapped not less 
than 40 diameters; provided, however, that the steel shall not be continuous through 
expansion joints. Expansion joints shall normally be provided every 40 feet. 
e. ?All tieback rods shall be steel and have a cross-sectional area equal to or greater than a #8 
reinforcing bar. All such rods shall be spaced not more than ten feet on center and shall 
have two or more coats of an approved protection material or treated by a hot dipped 
galvanized process. The length of all tie rods shall be equal to or greater than two times 
the height of the seawall slab projecting above the ground line. In no case shall the tie rods 
be of shorter length than 12 feet. 
f. ?All anchors shall be poured-in-place concrete, containing not less than nine cubic feet of 
concrete and have not less than 4.5 square feet of vertical surface perpendicular to the 
alignment of the tie rod. Each anchor shall contain vertical and horizontal steel 
reinforcement equivalent in cross-sectional area to two #4 deformed reinforcing bars per 
square foot, in each direction. 
g. ?The penetration of each seawall slab into firm ground shall be equal to 0.67 times the 
height of the wall above the ground line or 0.4 times the total length of the slab, whichever 
is greater. In no case shall the seawall slab be of shorter length than eight feet. 
h. ?The elevation for all seawalls, bulkheads and retaining walls fronting on the Bay shall be 
equal to, or greater than, elevation five feet U.S.C. & G.S. datum mean sea level. 
(2) ?Aluminum seawalls. 
a. ?Aluminum seawalls shall not have an exposed height of more than five feet. 
b. ?Sheet piles shall be fabricated from aluminum alloy 6061-T6, conforming to ASTM 
designation B209 alloy 6061 for chemical composition, having a minimum thickness of 
0.125 inches and minimum tensile strength of 35,500 PSI. Corrugations shall have nominal 
nine-inch pitch and nominal 2½-inch depth. The penetration into firm ground shall be equal 
to 0.67 times the height of the wall above the ground line or 0.4 times the total length of the 
sheet, whichever is greater. In no case shall the total sheet be less than six feet in length. 
Where sheet lengths required are more than 8.5 feet, and when soil conditions, surcharges 
and other factors exceed the scope of these standard specifications, a special design shall 
be submitted, signed and sealed by a state registered engineer. 
c. ?Cap and joint extrusion shall be fabricated from aluminum alloy 6063-T6, conforming to 
ASTM designation B221 alloy 6063 for chemical composition, having a minimum thickness 
of 0.15 inches and a minimum tensile strength of 30,000 PSI. The cap shall be a minimum 
of six inches wide and 5.75 inches deep. 
d. ?Anchor rods and deadman anchor plates shall be fabricated from aluminum alloy 6061-T6, 
conforming to ASTM designation B221 alloy 6061 for chemical composition, having a 
minimum thickness of anchor plates 0.10 inches and minimum tensile strength of 38,000 
PSI. The anchor plates shall be not less than 1.5 by 2.5 feet, equipped with a three-inch by 
2.25-inch backing channel 0.25 inches thick and 1.5 feet long. Anchor plates shall be 
placed with the top at least two feet below the elevation of the wall cap. The anchor rods 
shall be not less than 0.75 inches in diameter and equipped with a rod sleeve, nut and 
curved washer where it passes through the cap. Anchor rods shall be installed 
continuously along the wall at a maximum spacing of 6.5 feet. The normal length shall be 
12 feet. One tieback system shall be constructed at each end of the wall and thereafter one 
tieback system shall be constructed six feet, six inches on centers throughout. All tie rods 
shall be pre-tensioned after placement of backfill around anchor plates, but before final 
backfill sheeting. Such pre-tensioning shall not tend to move the sheets or anchors. Tie 
rods shall be placed in the coping so that the anchor pull brings the coping in direct contact 
with a bayside corrugation of the wall sheeting. 
e. ?Surcharge from fill behind the wall shall be controlled by limiting the slope to a maximum of 
ten degrees, and prohibiting objects other than landscaping to be located closer than five 
feet from the wall cap. The minimum standards described above assume sandy soil with 
an angle of repose of 30 degrees for soil against the wall. They also assume that the 
environment is not highly alkaline or acidic. If conditions require a design in excess of 
limitations specified in this subsection, the wall shall be of concrete construction in 
accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
f. ?If the aluminum material is brought in contact with mortar or concrete, a coating of clear 
methacrylate lacquer shall be applied to the aluminum contact surface to prevent 
corrosion. There shall be no dissimilar metals or metal systems bonded to the wall.

Sec. 70-3. - Terms. 
    Members of the planning and zoning board shall be appointed for overlapping terms of three years 
each, and each appointment shall run from the time of the appointment and until such appointees' 
successors are duly qualified. There shall be one member of the planning and zoning board appointed 
from each election district from within the city, who shall be appointed by the city commission based upon 
the recommendation from the city commissioner elected from that district. Redistricting may, on occasion, 
affect a member's appointment in the middle of his/her term. In that event, any commissioner may appoint 
or reappoint any citizen, notwithstanding that said citizen resides outside of the appointing 
commissioner's district due to redistricting for the purpose of filling the remainder of the unexpired term. In 
addition, there shall be one member appointed from the city at large, who shall be appointed by the city 
commission based upon the recommendation of the mayor. There shall be two members appointed from 
the city at large, who shall be appointed by the city commission, upon the recommendation of any 
member of the city commission. No appointed member shall serve longer than six consecutive years, 
unless, upon the sixth year expiration there is no available and qualified candidate to replace said 
expiring member, in which case, the appointment may be renewed beyond six consecutive years for an 
additional term. Partial terms shall not be counted toward the six-year term limitation. All members shall 
take an oath upon appointment. 
    The current fifteen member board shall be reduced in size through attrition in the following manner: if 
a member resigns before the completion of the member's term, said term shall not be filled until such time 
as the number of members totals seven; except in the event that not filling the unexpired term would 
leave a district without at least one appointment by the commissioner representing said district. 
    At the second regular city commission meeting in August held in 2016 and 2017, no appointments 
shall be made to fill the expiring terms until such time as the number of members totals seven. Exception: 
During this transition period, no district shall go without having at least one appointment by the 
commissioner representing said district.

ARTICLE II. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 


DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 


Sec. 70-31. - Purpose. 
(a) ?The purpose of site plan review, as set forth within this article, is to ensure compliance with all land 
development regulations and all other applicable standards and requirements as set forth by the city, 
prior to issuance of development permits. 
(b) ?The procedure is intended to insure that the location of structures, traffic circulation, parking 
facilities, and other site amenities, quantities and standards are provided in the furtherance of the 
public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morale and general welfare. 
(c) ?Architectural considerations. All proposed site plans shall be reviewed for excessive uniformity, 
dissimilarity, inappropriateness, or poor quality in the exterior design of buildings. Such lack of quality 
of design adversely affects the desirability of the immediate and neighboring areas for residential and 
nonresidential purposes, impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing properties in such areas, 
impairs the stability and value of improved and unimproved real property in such areas, and may 
prevent the most appropriate development of such areas. The resulting deterioration of property 
produces conditions which adversely affect the proper relationship between the taxable value of real 
properties in such areas and the costs of providing municipal services for them. Therefore, exterior 
building design shall be reviewed with the specific intent of preventing these and other harmful 
effects, promoting the most appropriate use of land within the city, and thereby promoting the health, 
safety, comfort, and general welfare of the community.

density or intensity of use. 
(b) ?Exemption of the items listed in subsection (a) from site plan review is not intended to eliminate the 
enumerated items from description requirements if the project or improvement is otherwise subject to 
site plan review. 
(c) ?The planning and zoning board shall have the authority to waive site plan requirements for 
modifications to existing structures that are necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the

Sec. 70-181. - Procedures for appeals from administrative decisions. 
(a) ?Who may appeal. Appeals to the planning and zoning board may be taken by any person 
aggrieved, including any officer, board, or commission of the city affected, by any decision of the 
administrative official under any provision of the land use regulations. Any such aggrieved person 
must first appeal such administrative official's decision to the planning and zoning board before 
appealing to circuit court, as provided below in section 70-243. 
(b) ?Staying of work on premises. An appeal to the planning and zoning board stays all work on the 
premises and all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed for, unless the official from whom 
the appeal was taken shall certify to the planning and zoning board, by reason of facts stated in the 
certificate that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings or 
work shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by the planning and 
zoning board or a court of record on application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is 
taken and on due cause shown. 
(c) ?Procedure . Any person appealing any decision of an administrative official shall make such appeal 
within 30 days after rendition of the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from in 
writing to the planning and zoning board and file the same, and copies thereof, with supporting facts 
and data with the city manager. This does not, however, restrict the filing of a request for a special 
exception or variance by any person at any time as provided for elsewhere in the land development 
regulations. Upon receipt of the appeal, the city manager shall forthwith examine such appeal or 
request application and endorse his recommendation thereon together with all documents, plans, 
papers or other materials constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken and 
transmit same to the planning and zoning board. Concurrently, the city manager shall transmit a 
copy of the appeal together with all documents, plans, papers or other materials constituting the 
record to the city attorney for his review and legal opinion. The city attorney shall present his legal 
opinion to the planning and zoning board with respect to two items as follows: 
(1) ?Whether the appeal is in fact an appeal and within the province of the planning and zoning 
board; and 
(2) ?The legal merits of the appeal proper, if requested by the board.

DIVISION 2. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS 


Sec. 70-201. - Procedure. 
(a) ?Except as provided for in subsection (c), the planning and zoning board shall hear and decide 
special exceptions, decide such questions as are involved in determining when special exceptions 
should be granted, and grant special exceptions with appropriate conditions and safeguards or deny 
special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of the land development 
regulations. With the exception of single-family and duplex development proposals, all requests for 
special exception usage shall be accompanied by a site plan which shall undergo concurrent review 
by the planning and zoning board. In the case of special exceptions requiring city commission final 
approval, final site plan approval by the city commission shall be required. In granting any special 
exception, the planning and zoning board shall find that such grant will not adversely affect the public 
interest. 
(b) ?In granting any special exception, the planning and zoning board, in addition to the standards 
enumerated in the land development regulations, may prescribe appropriate conditions and 
safeguards in conformity with the land development regulations. Violation of such conditions and 
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be 
deemed a violation of the land development regulations. If, within 12 months of the date of approval 
of an application for a special exception, a building permit has not been applied for, the approved 
special exception becomes null and void, provided however, that the approving board and the 
applicant may jointly agree to extend such time period. 
(c) ?Applications for any special exception uses and related site plan in the CG zoning district which 
would have the effect of removing property from the tax rolls of the city, shall be heard by and 
decided by the city commission, after referral to, investigation by, and a review and recommendation 
of the planning and zoning board. In deciding such special exceptions and site plan reviews, the city 
commission shall consider the same factors, make the same findings, may prescribe conditions and 
may prescribe the same reasonable time limits as set forth in subsections (a) and (b). The violation 
of any such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special 
exception and related site plan is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the land development 
regulations.

DIVISION 3. - VARIANCES 


Sec. 70-221. - Procedure. 
    The planning and zoning board or the city commission, as provided for by this Code, may authorize a 
variance from the provisions of the land development regulations that are not contrary to the public 
interest. The power and authority to grant variances to parking requirements, building height, and 
waterfront yards abutting the Gulf of Mexico or public beach will be solely within the jurisdiction of the city 
commission. In no instance shall a variance be granted to density. The planning and zoning board or the 
city commission, as applicable, shall not review a variance request until: 
(1) ?An application for such variance has been received by the city manager or specified designee, 
stating the special conditions and circumstances applying to the building, structure, or land for 
which such variance is sought. The applicant shall submit a narrative that explains the variance 
being requested in a manner that addresses the criteria specified in subsection (d) as they 
relate to the specific request. Since each application is considered based upon the unique 
circumstances presented by such application, prior decisions of the board or commission shall 
not constitute grounds for the granting of any variance. 
(2) ?The board or commission has received a report from the city manager or specified designee 
that evaluates the application based on the criteria required by this section. 
(3) ?The board or commission holds a public hearing after written and posted notice has been given 
to the extent provided by chapter 70. 
(4) ?The board or commission has considered the following criteria and find that they have been 
substantially satisfied and a hardship exists: 
a. ?The variance is in fact a variance as set forth within the land development regulations and 
within the province of the board or commission based upon the opinion of the city manager 
or his designee; 
b. ?Special conditions or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or 
land for which the variance is sought and do not apply generally to buildings, structures, or 
lands in the same zoning district; 
c. ?Strict application of the provisions of the land development regulations would not permit the 
applicant reasonable use of the building; structure, or land; 
d. ?The peculiar conditions and circumstances existing are not the result of the actions of the 
applicant, the applicant agent's agents, or the applicant's predecessors in title; 
e. ?The variance proposed to be granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the 
reasonable use of the building, structure, or land; 
f. ?Owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
Special conditions to be considered pursuant to this section of the land development 
regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the following circumstances: 
1. ?Redevelopment. If the proposed project involves the redevelopment or utilization of an 
existing developed or partially developed site. 
2. ?Substandard lot(s). If the proposed project involves the utilization of an existing legal 
nonconforming lot(s). 
3. ?Neighborhood character. If the proposed project promotes the established 
development pattern of a block face, including setbacks, building height, and other 
dimensional requirements. 
4. ?Public facilities. If the proposed project involves the development of public parks, 
public facilities or public utilities. 
5. ?Architectural and/or engineering considerations. If the proposed project utilizes 
architectural and/or engineering features that would render the project more disaster 
resistant. 
g. ?The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this 
chapter; 
h. ?The granting of the variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise 
detrimental to the public welfare. 
(5) ?In granting any variance, the planning and zoning board or city commission may prescribe 
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the land development regulations. 
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the 
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(6) ?Under no circumstances shall the planning and zoning board or city commission grant a 
variance to permit a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the zoning district 
involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the land development regulations. 
(7) ?The granted variance shall be valid for one-year. To remain in effect after one-year, one of the 
following must have occurred: 
a. ?An extension of time has been approved by the approving body; 
b. ?Building permits relating to the requested variance have either been applied for or granted; 
or 
c. ?A site plan review relating to the requested variance has been applied for or approved by 
the planning and zoning board. 
Any requests for an extension of time relating to a variance(s) must be in writing and received by the city 
manager or specified designee at least three weeks prior to its expiration date in order for the request to 
be placed on the approving body's agenda.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 


Sec. 72-1. - Intent and purpose. 
(a) ?It is the legislative intent of this section to protect and preserve the appearance, character, value 
and safety of the city's urban area and nearby properties and, by so doing, promote the general 
welfare of the community. 
(b) ?The purpose is to improve the appearance of properties within the city through the protection, 
installation, and maintenance of trees and landscaping for screening and aesthetic effects, and to 
recognize the importance of such trees and landscaping, in the enhancement of property values, the 
improvement of air quality, and their contribution to the cooling of our environment. It is also 
recognized that native tree and landscape species are most compatible with the city's climate and 
soil conditions, require less irrigation and fertilization than do exotic species, and therefore help to 
conserve water and reduce the pollution in stormwater runoff, which in turn helps to maintain the 
water quality of Boca Ciega Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, the use of native tree and 
landscape species, and removal of exotic trees and vegetation, is strongly encouraged. The planting 
of exotic trees and vegetation is to be generally prohibited. 
(c) ?Topography, flooding characteristics, soil conditions, and the existence of wetlands or other areas 
containing protected species or habitats are among the factors which make some areas 
environmentally sensitive. In order to protect environmentally sensitive lands, it may be necessary to 
prohibit development, or limit the allowable density and intensity of development, in these areas. 
Protection of environmentally sensitive land promotes the well being of the residents of the city 
because they perform vital functions, such as providing habitat for fish, birds, mammals, and reptiles. 
Protection of environmentally sensitive land also results in the protection of community recreation 
opportunities, such as fishing, nature observation, and photography, as well as the protection of 
aesthetics and property values.

(a) ?An area or a combination of areas equal to ten percent of the total vehicular use area shall be 
devoted to interior landscaping. Any perimeter landscaping provided in excess of that required may 
be counted as part of the interior landscaping requirement. Landscaping adjacent to a structure or 
structures on the same parcel of land which serves to beautify the vehicular use area and 
implements the purpose and intent of this article may be counted toward meeting the interior 
landscape requirements. The credit may not exceed 25 percent of the total required interior 
landscaping and shall be reviewed by the designated official for compliance with the purpose and 
intent of this article. 
(b) ?Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner so as to divide and break up the 
monotony and expanse of paving, to prevent and discourage cross taxiing and to provide well-
dispersed tree canopy shading. A combination of the following interior landscaping elements shall be 
counted as part of the interior landscaping requirements where applicable. 
(1) ?Terminal islands. Contiguous rows of ten or more parking spaces shall be terminated on both 
ends by landscaped islands which measure an average of not less than five feet in width and 
extend the entire length of the parking space(s). At least one tree or grouping, as per subsection 
72-39(2)a, shall be planted on such island. 
(2) ?Interior islands. Interior landscaped islands which measure an average of not less than five feet 
in width and extend the length of a parking space shall be placed within rows of contiguous 
parking spaces so that there is at least one interior island for every 15 parking spaces or major 
portion thereof within the row. These islands shall be placed at intervals of not less than six nor 
more than 18 spaces. At least one tree or grouping, as per subsection 72-39(2)a shall be 
planted on every interior island. Interior islands need not be placed directly opposite each other 
when in abutting parking rows. 
(3) ?Additional interior landscaping requirements. 
a. ?Trees. There shall be a minimum of one tree, planted for each separate planter installed in 
the vehicular use area, but the total number of trees shall not be less than one for each 
200 square feet, or fraction thereof, of required interior landscaped area. 
b. ?Perimeter landscaping. In vehicular use areas where the strict application of this section 
will seriously limit the function of such area, the required landscaping may be located near 
the perimeter of the paved area, including such perimeters which may be adjacent to a 
building on the site. Such required interior landscaping which is relocated as herein 
provided shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements. 
c. ?Vehicle encroachment; wheel stops. The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior 
landscaped area when such area is at least 3½ feet in depth per abutting parking space 
and protected by wheel stops that are anchored and placed within the confines of a parking 
area or curbing. Two feet of such interior landscaped area may be part of the required 
depth of each abutting parking space.

intersection of two or more public rights-of-way, all landscaping within the triangular areas shall provide 
unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between 30 inches and seven feet; provided, however, trees or 
palms having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-
visibility area shall be allowed, provided they are so located as to not create a traffic hazard. 
Landscaping, except required grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the 
edge of any accessway pavement. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 40-29, 9-19-95) 


Sec. 72-44. - Existing plant material. 
    In instances where healthy native plant material exists on a site prior to its development, in part or in 
whole, for the purposes of off-street parking or other vehicular use areas, the application of the above 
landscape standards may be adjusted to allow credit for such plant material if such an adjustment is in 
keeping with and will preserve the intent of this article. In no event will exotic species such as Australian 
Pine, Bishopwood, Brazilian Pepper, Punk tree, Ear tree, Laurel fig, Weeping fig, Eucalyptus and Willow 
trees be considered for credit. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 40-30, 9-19-95)

valuation of the existing structure as reflected on the property appraiser's current records. 
(4) ?If an existing structure is increased in covered floor area by ten percent or greater. 
(5) ?If an amendment is required to an existing final site plan. 
(b) ?However, in the event that such compliance would prohibit required parking areas from meeting the 
minimum off-street parking requirements, as set forth in other sections of this Code then the 
requirements of this section may be adjusted, first modifying the requirements of the interior 
landscaping requirements portion and, if minimum off-street parking requirements still cannot be met, 
then modifying the requirements of the perimeter landscaping portion. 
(c) ?The requirements for the responsibility of the owner, tenant or agent for the maintenance of parkway 
and right-of-way outside the property line contiguous to the site, as set forth herein, shall become 
immediately effective and applicable to all existing developed properties upon passage of this article.

DIVISION 3. - PROTECTION OF TREES 


Sec. 72-111. - Removal of trees. 
(a) ?Special conditions for authorization to remove native and/or protected trees. 
(1) ?It is the intent of this section to minimize the removal of native and/or protected trees and that 
no authorization shall be granted to remove a tree if the developer has failed to take reasonable 
measures to design and locate the proposed improvements so that the least number of native 
and/or protected trees will be removed. In particular, the design must attempt to preserve 
specimen and historic trees. 
(2) ?No authorization for the removal of a native and/or protected tree shall be granted unless the 
developer; demonstrates that one or more of the following conditions exists: 
a. ?A permissible use of the site cannot reasonably be undertaken unless specific trees are 
removed or relocated. 
b. ?The tree is located in such proximity to an existing or proposed structure that the safety, 
utility or structural integrity of the structure is materially impaired. 
c. ?The tree materially interferes with the location, servicing or functioning of existing utility 
lines or services. 
d. ?The tree creates a substantial hazard to motor, bicycle or pedestrian traffic due to physical 
proximity to traffic or impairment of vision. 
e. ?The tree is diseased or weakened by age, abuse, storm or fire and is likely to cause injury 
or damage to people, buildings or other improvements. 
f. ?Any law or regulation requires the removal. 
(3) ?Authorization required. No native or otherwise protected tree (two-inch diameter at breast 
height or larger) shall be removed without prior authorization by the city. The city manager or 
his/her designee shall have the authority to issue tree removal permits, subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (b) of this section. 
(b) ?Replacement of removed trees. 
(1) ?Trees removed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be replaced at the expense of 
the developer. 
(2) ?For each inch of diameter at breast height removed, an inch of diameter at breast height shall 
be replaced. 
(3) ?A replacement tree may be a tree moved from one location to another on the site, or moved off 
the site pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(4) ?Replacement trees shall, if practicable, be planted on the development site. If on-site 
replacement is not practicable, replacement trees may be donated, or a fee in lieu may be paid 
to the city for the purpose of planting trees on public property. The fee in lieu shall be based on 
the cost of purchasing the requisite size and number of replacement trees. 
(c) ?Historic and specimen trees. 
(1) ?A historic tree is one that has been designated by the city commission as one of notable 
historical interest and value to the city because of its location or historical association with the 
city community. A public hearing shall be held by the city commission on the designation with 
due notice to the owner of the tree. 
(2) ?A specimen tree is one that has been officially designated by the city commission to be of high 
value because of it type, size, age, or other relevant criteria. A public hearing on the designation 
shall be held by the city commission with due notice to the owner of the tree. 
(3) ?No historic or specimen tree shall be removed without a finding by the city commission that the 
tree is a hazard or that it is not economically or practically feasible to develop the parcel without 
removing the historic or specimen tree. The city manager shall make a presentation to the 
commission on the application and make a recommendation as to whether it should be 
approved or denied. The decision by the city commission on the application shall be made 
within 30 days of the date the application was filed. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 40-42, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 00-08, § 43, 1-9-01) 


Sec. 72-112. - Protection of trees during development activities. 
(a) ?Generally. 
(1) ?To assure the health and survival of protected trees that are not to be removed, the developer 
shall avoid the following kinds of tree injuries during all development activities: 
a. ?Mechanical injuries to roots, trunk and branches; 
b. ?Injuries by chemical poisoning; 
c. ?Injuries by grade changes; 
d. ?Injuries by excavations; and 
e. ?Injuries by paving. 
(2) ?At a minimum, the protective measures described in subsections (b) through (f) of this section 
shall be taken where appropriate to the development activity. 
(b) ?Avoiding mechanical injuries. 
(1) ?Prior to any land preparation or other development activities, a protective barrier easily visible 
to equipment operators shall be placed around all protected trees so as to encompass the entire 
tree protection zone. See Figure 2-A. 
(2) ?No attachment, wires (other than supportive wires), signs or permits may be fastened to any 
protected tree. 
(3) ?No equipment, construction materials or debris of any kind shall be placed within the protective 
barrier. 
(4) ?Landscaping activities within the bounds of the protective barrier (before and after it is 
removed) shall be accomplished with light machinery or manual labor. Grubbing and similar 
activities are prohibited. 
(5) ?In lieu of constructing the barriers required in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the developer 
may physically designate large areas containing protected trees where no land preparation or 
other development activities of any kind will occur. The area shall be designated by placing 
stakes a maximum of 25 feet apart and tying ribbon, plastic tape, rope, etc., from stake to stake 
along the outside perimeter of the area. This perimeter line shall be beyond the tree protection 
zone of any protected trees growing within the area. 
(6) ?Required protective barriers and perimeter lines shall remain in place until all construction 
activity, except landscaping within the protected area, is terminated. 
(c) ?Avoiding injuries due to chemical poisoning. 
(1) ?No fuel, paint, solvent, oil, thinner, asphalt, cement, grout or any other construction chemical or 
other material or tools of any kind shall be stored, or allowed in any manner to enter, within a 
required protective barrier or perimeter line. 
(2) ?No equipment shall be cleaned within a required protective barrier or perimeter line. 
(d) ?Avoiding injuries due to grade changes. Grade changes shall not be made within the tree protection 
zone unless the following protective measures are taken: 
(1) ?Raising the grade. When raising the grade, the following measures shall be taken: 
a. ?Within the tree protection zone, existing sod, vegetation and leaf litter shall be removed 
and the soil loosened without injuring the roots. 
b. ?The area within the tree protection zone shall be properly fertilized to improve the vigor and 
growth of the roots. 
c. ?Porous, four inch agriculture drain shall be laid over the soil to drain liquids away from the 
trunk. A drop of at least one-eighth inch per foot shall be provided. The drain field shall be 
designed to provide adequate drainage of the existing configuration of the trees. 
d. ?The number of drains shall depend upon soil material; lighter sandy soils and porous 
gravelly material require fewer drains than heavy nonporous soils. 
e. ?Aeration shall be provided by installing vertical tiles along the system. The vertical tiles 
shall be filled with gravel and capped with a heavy-duty mesh to keep out trash and debris. 
f. ?Dry wells shall be large enough to allow for maximum growth of the tree trunk. Most large 
shade trees require at least a 60-inch diameter well. For slow-growing mature trees, a 
space of 12 to 18 inches shall be provided between the trunk and the side of the well at 
every point. 
g. ?To prevent washing of material into the well, the dry well casing walls shall be high enough 
to bring the coping just above the level of the proposed fill. 
h. ?Dry well walls shall be constructed of materials that permit passage of air and water. 
Concrete blocks backed with galvanized screening may be used for the sides of the well. 
i. ?Gratings or barriers shall be used around openings that are large enough to present a 
hazard to pedestrians. 
j. ?Open wells shall be cleaned regularly to remove sediment, leaves, and debris that might 
interfere with the free passage of air. 
k. ?Large stones shall be placed over the drainage tiles and a layer of smaller stones shall be 
placed over the remainder of the ground within the drip line. 
l. ?A layer of gravel shall be placed over the stones. 
m. ?The fill shall be completed with a layer of porous soil. See Figures 2-B, 2-C, 2-D. 
(2) ?Lowering the grade. When lowering the grade, the following measures shall be taken: 
a. ?Roots shall be cut cleanly and re-trimmed after excavation. 
b. ?The canopy shall be pruned to aid in maintaining tree vigor. 
c. ?When lowering the grade of the soil surrounding a protected tree, the maximum number of 
tree roots within the tree protection zone shall be preserved by using any of the following 
methods: 
1. ?Terracing. The area within the tree protection zone is left at the original grade by 
terracing. 
2. ?Retaining wall. The area within the tree protection zone is left at the original grade 
constructing a dry retaining wall. The retaining wall shall be porous to allow for 
aeration. 
3. ?Terracing and retaining wall. The area within the tree protection zone is left at the 
original grade by the combined use of terracing and dry retaining wall. See Figure 2-E. 
(3) ?Minor changes in grade. When the change in grade is minor, as determined by the city 
manager, lesser protective measures than those described in subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 
this section may be taken. The city manager shall approve the use of these methods where 
their use will not endanger the health of the protected tree. 
(e) ?Avoiding injuries due to excavations. 
(1) ?Water, sewer, and other utility lines should be routed around the tree protection zones of 
protected trees. 
(2) ?If a line cannot reasonably be routed around the tree protection zone, the line shall be tunneled 
beneath the area within the zone. The tunnel shall be offset to one side of the trunk to prevent 
damage to the main tap roots. 
(f) ?Avoiding injury by paving within the drip line. Porous paving may be placed within the tree protection 
zone of a protected tree, so long as no damage is inflicted to the tree by grade change, compaction 
of the soil, or any other cause.

Sec. 72-113. - Special provisions for the protection of mangroves. 
(a) ?Generally. In addition to the foregoing tree protection requirements, the following special provisions 
shall apply to the removal or alteration of mangroves (Black mangrove, Avicennia germinans; white 
mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa; red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle) and other vegetation from 
wetland areas, as defined in F.S. § 373.019, and Rule 62-340.200, F.A.C. These standards shall 
apply to all property owners, including single-family, duplex, and multifamily homeowners. 
(b) ?Replacement. Mangroves and wetland vegetation may not be removed unless the developer 
replaces or relocates on the same development site at least an equal number of mangroves and 
sufficient other wetland vegetation to revegetate a land area equal to or greater than the land area 
from which mangroves/wetland vegetation was removed. The developer shall provide a plan, to be 
approved by the city manager, to ensure the survival of the replaced or relocated mangroves and 
wetland vegetation, and to stabilize the shoreline from which mangroves/wetland vegetation was 
removed. The approved plan shall be an express condition of any permit. Failure to carry out any 
provision of the plan shall be a violation of this Code. 
(c) ?Other protective measures. The following protective measures shall apply to all mangroves and/or 
wetland vegetation:

ARTICLE IV. - ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDS 


Sec. 72-141. - Purpose. 
    Topography, flooding characteristics, soil conditions, and the existence of wetlands or other areas 
containing protected species or habitats are among the factors which make some areas environmentally 
sensitive. In order to protect environmentally sensitive land, it may be necessary to prohibit development, 
or limit the allowable density and intensity of development, in those areas. Protection of environmentally 
sensitive land promotes the well-being of the residents of the city because they perform vital functions, 
such as providing habitat for fish, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Protection of environmentally sensitive 
land also results in the protection of community recreation opportunities, such as fishing, nature 
observation, and photography, as well as the protection of aesthetics and property values.

Sec. 72-142. - Development impacting beaches. 
    Construction seaward of the coastal construction control line, as described in rule 62B-26.011, 
F.A.C., is subject to the provisions of F.S. § 161.052, and the permitting authority of the Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), pursuant to Chapters 62B-33 and 62B-41, F.A.C. In 
addition, a dune preservation zone is hereby established, to include all shore areas seaward of said 
coastal construction control line. Within this zone, excavation, destruction of native vegetation, and any 
other activities which are likely to adversely impact or affect the natural fluctuation of any primary sand 
dune are prohibited. Any development activity which is likely to impact a marine turtle nesting area is 
subject to the additional criteria and DEP permitting requirements in Rule 62B-41.0055, F.A.C. Marine 
turtle nests shall not be disturbed, and shall, upon discovery, be reported immediately to the Florida 
Marine Patrol.

Sec. 72-143. - Protecting habitat. 
    Prior to any development which is likely to impact an area populated by federally or state listed 
endangered, threatened, or species of special concern the applicant must demonstrate that the habitat for 
such species is either being preserved on-site or that off-site mitigation which is consistent with federal, 
state and regional policies is being accomplished. In addition, all development which is likely to generate 
or attract increased boating activity in an area known to be frequented by manatees shall establish an 
area specific manatee protection plan in cooperation with FDEP and U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to 
ensure long range manatee and habitat protection.

Sec. 73-32. - General sign requirements. 
(a) ?Permitting process. 
(1) ?All signs, except those specifically exempted, shall require a zoning clearance and permit prior 
to erection. 
(2) ?Applicants for sign permits shall provide the following information: 
a. ?Detailed scale drawing of the sign showing all dimensions. 
b. ?Accurate plot plan drawn to scale showing location of the sign on site. Such plan shall 
show location of all uses on site, including but not limited to structures, parking areas, 
driveways, green areas, walkways and roadways. 
c. ?Survey of the parcel on which the sign is to be placed (this may be waived for attached 
signs). 
d. ?Statement signed by the permit applicant as to the number and size of existing on-site 
signs. 
e. ?Application for attached signs shall include a plan showing dimensions and layout of the 
building. 
f. ?Information as may be required by the city building department. 
g. ?Other appropriate information relative to the sign and its location. 
h. ?Signs of a height greater than six feet and within ten feet of current or proposed right-of-
way lines shall require a letter of no objection from the local electric power company to 
insure current and future compliance to applicable codes and to protect the safety of the 
public. 
(b) ?Relationship to other codes. 
(1) ?All signs shall comply with applicable building electrical and maintenance codes. 
(2) ?Maintenance of signs. 
a. ?The maintenance of signs shall be in such a way as to insure that the public health, safety 
and welfare is maintained. The owner and/or leaseholder shall be responsible for keeping 
the area immediately surrounding the sign free from trash and debris as per section 18-35, 
and shall be responsible for maintaining the signs concerned in good operating condition 
and appearance. Failure to comply with this section shall constitute cause for revocation of 
the sign permit and removal of the sign, if the owner and/or leaseholder fails to correct 
same within ten days after written notice of violation. 
b. ?The city sign inspector is authorized to immediately remove any unauthorized signs 
erected on city property. The city sign inspector is also authorized to remove any sign that 
is not properly maintained or, in the opinion of the city sign inspector, is unsafe or 
hazardous after giving written notice to the person in charge of the sign at least ten days 
prior to such removal. Authority is hereby given to the sign inspector to remove or cause to 
be removed any or all signs constructed or maintained in violation of the provisions of this 
article; and to assess the cost of such removal against the owner of the property. 
c. ?All signs located on a property shall be removed upon ten days' written notice to the owner 
of the property if the property shall remain vacant for 60 continuous days. Removal of all 
advertising material shall be completed within the time limit set out in this subsection. 
Removal of the entire sign structure shall be accomplished within six months of the written 
notice set out in subsection (b)(2)b of this section. 
(c) ?Nonconforming signs. 
(1) ?Except as provided herein, no nonconforming sign shall be moved, reconstructed, extended, 
enlarged or altered, unless changed to conform with these regulations. 
(2) ?Nonconforming signs may be maintained or repaired, or, the message on the sign may be 
changed. 
(3) ?A building or site which is improved or redeveloped at a cost in excess of 50 percent of the 
assessed value of the existing building or site, shall require any nonconforming sign which is 
located on or is a part of such building or site to conform to this article. 
(4) ?Signs that existed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives that 
were not in conformance with previous regulations are illegal signs and shall conform with these 
regulations or be removed within 90 calendar days of the effective date of this article. 
(5) ?Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in this article, no nonconforming sign is required to be 
removed solely by the passage of time if to so require, without compensation, is otherwise 
prohibited by state and federal laws. 
(d) ?Removal of nonconforming signs. 
(1) ?All legally erected nonconforming signs must be made to conform to the applicable provisions 
of this article within seven years of the effective date of this article. 
(2) ?In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that, as applied to a particular 
nonconforming sign, the seven year period for attaining conforming status is not enforceable, 
then a ten-year period shall apply. 
(3) ?In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that, as applied to a particular 
nonconforming sign, the period for attaining conforming status provided for in subsection (d)(1) 
or (2) of this section, is unenforceable, then the court shall determine what additional period of 
time shall be required and, consistent with subsection (d)(4) of this section, that period shall 
tack onto the otherwise applicable time period. 
(4) ?The intent of subsection (d)(2) and (3) of this section is to prevent a successful legal challenge 
to the application of these removal provisions from requiring the amortization period to begin 
anew. Therefore, any additional period of time either required by the preceding three-year 
extension provision of subsection (d)(2) of this section or any court decision that extends the 
time beyond ten years under subsection (d)(3) of this section, shall tack onto the period of time 
that has passed since the effective date of this article for purpose of calculating the eventual 
removal date. 
(e) ?Variances. 
(1) ?Requests authorized. Requests for variances from any provisions of this article are hereby 
authorized and shall be processed by the planning and zoning board pursuant to section 70-
221. 
(2) ?Criteria. Variances from the terms of these regulations may not be contrary to the public 
interest. Variances may be granted where, owing to special conditions, the literal enforcement 
of the provisions would result in unnecessary hardship, not to include economic hardship. 
However, no variance shall be granted unless the criteria of section 70-221 are met. In addition 
to these usual criteria for variances to the provisions of this article, any additional signage 
allowed pursuant to variances shall be conditioned in such a way that, taking into consideration 
existing allowable signage in the area, the additional signage does not exacerbate visual clutter, 
driver distraction or traffic safety in the area. 
(3) ?Variances to the time limit for removal of nonconforming signs. Requests for variances of up to 
three additional years beyond the seven-year period that would otherwise be allowed under 
subsection (d)(1) of this section may be granted where, owing to the peculiar facts of the 
structure involved, and based on no single one of the criteria listed below, but rather when, on 
balance, the private loss suffered by owners of the particular structure is substantial when 
compared to the public benefit achieved by the consistent application for the amortization 
period. The specific criteria for determination of a variance to the seven-year removal period 
shall include the following considerations: 
a. ?Length of the amortization period in relation to the investment; 
b. ?A sign owner does not have to be given a period of time necessary to permit him to recoup 
his investment entirely, but an amortization period should not be so short as to result in a 
substantial loss of the sign owner's investment; 
c. ?Initial capital investment; 
d. ?Investment realization to date; 
e. ?Life expectancy of investment; depreciation schedules; 
f. ?Existence or nonexistence of a lease obligation, as well as a contingency clause permitting 
termination of the lease; 
g. ?Removal costs directly attributable to the regulatory effects of the article; 
h. ?The depreciation period of the sign structure; 
i. ?Location of the sign structure; 
j. ?What part of the owner's total business is concerned; 
k. ?Monopoly or advantage, if any, resulting from the fact that similar new structures are 
prohibited in the same area; and: 
1. ?The fact that the use is also on public streets since the messages are directed to the 
passerby. 
2. ?No variance under this subsection shall be granted unless the conditions listed under 
section 70-221 are also satisfied. 
(f) ?Signs on public lands. Signs shall not be located on publicly-owned land or easements or inside 
street rights-of-way except signs required or erected by permission of the city manager. Signs shall 
include, but not be limited to, handbills, posters, advertisements or notices that are attached in any 
way upon lamp posts, telephone poles, utility poles, bridges and sidewalks. All signs shall be 
removed by the owner of the sign at no expense to the city when the signs are within any public 
property including existing right-of-way. Nothing shall prohibit a duly authorized public official from 
removing a sign from public property. 
(g) ?Official signs, notices, etc. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent or limit the display of 
legal notices, warnings, informational, directional, traffic or other such signs which are legally 
required or necessary for the essential functions of governmental agencies. 
(h) ?Illumination. 
(1) ?The light from any illuminated sign shall be shaded, shielded or directed from adjoining 
residential and nonresidential parcels. 
(2) ?No sign shall have blinking, flashing or fluttering lights or other illumination devices which have 
a changing light intensity, brightness, color or direction. 
(3) ?No colored lights shall be used at any location or in any manner so as to be confused with or 
construed as traffic control devices. 
(4) ?Neither the direct nor the reflected light from primary light sources shall create a traffic hazard 
to operators of motor vehicles on public thoroughfares. 
(i) ?Intent. It is the intent of the city commission that protection of First Amendment rights shall be 
afforded such that any sign, display or device allowed under these regulations may contain, in lieu of 
any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct attention to a 
business operated for profit, or to a commodity or service for sale, and that complies with size, 
lighting and space requirements of this article.

Sec. 73-35. - Computation of dimensions. 
(a) ?Computation of total permitted sign area. 
(1) ?The permitted sign area for freestanding signs shall be based upon one square foot in RFM-30 
and RFH-50 zoning districts and one-half square foot in CG zoning districts, for each linear foot 
of zone lot frontage, up to a maximum amount as established in section 73-36. 
(2) ?The permitted sign area for attached signs shall be based upon one square foot for each linear 
foot of building frontage, up to a maximum amount as established in section 73-36. 
(3) ?Zone lots fronting two or more streets are allowed the permitted signage for each frontage, but 
signage cannot be accumulated and used on one street in excess of that allowed for the zone 
lot based on that one street frontage. 
(b) ?Computation of sign area. 
(1) ?The area of a sign shall be computed on the basis of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, 
other geometric figure, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the 
writing, representation, emblem, lighting or other display, together with any material, color or 
border trim forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the 
sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. The computation of sign area 
does not include any framework, bracing, fence or wall that is reasonably necessary to support 
the sign. 
(2) ?The area of a sign shall be computed on a per sign face basis and all requirements with 
respect to sign area reference the area of a single face of a sign. A double-faced sign shall be 
permitted to have the allowed area for a single-faced sign on each of the two faces of the 
double-faced sign. 
(c) ?Computation of sign height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance 
from the base of the sign at ground level to the top of any portion of the sign structure. In cases 
where the ground level, as defined herein, cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be 
derived on the assumption that the elevation of the ground at the base of the sign is equal to the 
average elevation at the front property line of the zone lot. 
In the case where a freestanding sign is on a parcel contiguous to an overpass or elevated road 
(excluding service roads) from which the sign is designed to be viewed, the height of the sign shall be 
measured from the highest point of the overpass or elevated road at the crown of the roadway surface to 
the top of the sign, the highest point to be determined by the average elevation between the 
perpendicular extension of the contiguous zone lot lines on which the sign is to be located, as such lot 
lines intersect the overpass or elevated road (see illustration in the appendix to this chapter). Any sign 
erector who requests to use this calculation for height determination shall provide to the building official 
sufficient information in the form of surveys, engineered drawings, official roadway elevation data and 
other official documentation to allow accurate determination of roadway heights. No permit shall be 
issued where insufficient information is provided. 
(d) ?Computation of visual clearance and sight triangle. The visual clearance and sight triangle, to 
assure adequate sign distance at the intersection of two public roadways and at the intersection of a 
public roadway and an accessway or driveway, shall follow the criteria of the Florida Department of 
Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance 
for Streets and Highways, or criteria otherwise specified by the city building official. 
(e) ?Computation of sign dimensions. The computation of sign dimensions shall be as set forth herein 
and depicted in the appropriate figure delineating same in the appendix to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 95-10, § 41-20, 9-19-95; Ord. No. 15-03, § 3, 7-7-15 ) 


Sec. 73-36. - Permitted signs and standards by zoning districts. 
(a) ?Purpose and procedure. It is the intent of this section to regulate signs consistent with the zoning

distance shall be determined by the city building official pursuant to subsection 73-35(d). 
(2) ?Signs for multifamily residential areas shall be permitted only as follows: 
a. ?Number. A maximum of one sign is permitted for each platted subdivision or property 
entrance.
