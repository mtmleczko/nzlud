PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Okeechobee, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through November 19, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John R. Cook, City Attorney, Bonnie S. Thomas, City Clerk, Lane Gamiotea, Deputy City Clerk and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(3)  A local vendor preference shall be afforded to a regional business, as described in subsection (a), above, in the following manner: Competitive bid (local price match option). Each formal competitive bid solicitation (i.e. sealed bids) shall clearly identify how the price order of the bids received will be evaluated and determined. When a qualified and responsive, nonlocal, nonregional business submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by one or more qualified and responsive regional businesses is within five percent of the price submitted by the nonlocal business, then the regional business with the apparent lowest bid offer shall have the opportunity to submit an offer to match the price(s) offered by the overall lowest qualified and responsive nonlocal, nonregional bidder. In such instances, staff shall first verify if all bidders are in fact qualified and responsive bidders. If the lowest regional bidder meets the requirements of F.S. § 287.087, the city administrator, or his designee, shall invite the lowest regional bidder in writing to submit a matching offer, which shall be submitted in writing to the city administrator's office within five business days thereafter. If the lowest regional bidder submits a written offer that does not fully match the lowest bid from the lowest nonlocal, nonregional bid tendered previously, that regional bid shall be removed from consideration and the next lowest fully qualified regional bidder will be given the opportunity to match said bid if they are within five percent. This cycle shall be repeated until there are no remaining regional business bids. If the lowest regional bidder declines or is unable to match the lowest nonlocal, nonregional bid price(s), then the award will eventually be made to the lowest overall qualified and responsive bidder. If the lowest regional bidder does not meet the requirement of F.S. § 287.087, and the lowest nonlocal, nonregional bidder does, the lowest regional bidder will be disqualified and the next lowest regional bidder will be considered if they are within five percent. In the event a regional bidder is awarded a contract pursuant to this section, all requests for change orders increasing the costs of the project must be approved by the city council. 
(e)  Local vendor preference awards will be made to responsible qualified local businesses. The local vendor preference may be waived if the cost of the award would exceed the budget of the city for the general services and/or goods requested. 
(f)  The city council reserves the exclusive right to exercise the option as to whether or not to apply the local vendor preference to any procurement. 
(g)  The method outlined for tie bids in the purchasing policies and procedures manual will be used to determine the final award in the event two or more formal bids, requests for proposals, or quotations are received and are equal after calculating the appropriate local vendor preference. 
(h)  Persons, firms, partnerships, companies or corporations who desire to be considered for the local vendor preference must complete an application and affidavit provided in the solicitation documents and return it with their bid, request for proposal, or quotation. Upon a finding by the city that the application and affidavit is sufficient and meets the local vendor criteria, the person, firm, partnerships, companies or corporation that provide the application and affidavit with their solicitation will be allowed to receive a local vendor preference. Vendors shall not have the opportunity to change the application or affidavit once submitted to the city and shall have the burden of demonstrating that it meets the definition. 
(i)  The local vendor preference as provided in this section shall not apply to the following contracts or purchases: 
(1)  Professional services which are subject to the State of Florida Consultants Competitive Negotiations Act (F.S. § 287.055).

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
(b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm or immediate concern is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstance makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. 
(c)  Any police officer or other law enforcement officer may arrest any suspected loiterer or prowler without a warrant in case delay in procuring one would probably enable such suspected loiterer or prowler to escape arrest.

(1)  For purposes of this ordinance, amusement devices are defined as those machines or gaming devices whereby a patron must pay or insert money to play various games, usually video in nature, pin-ball, poker, or similar games of chance, with the possibility of reward for playing successfully, such as money, additional free games, points, or other reward. 
(b)  No business shall be issued a business tax receipt to permit or otherwise conduct or condone the business of pool or billiard parlor, game room or amusement parlor within 500 feet of real property currently operating as a house of worship, church, or other congregation designated as such, or public or private school or day care center, and qualifying as such under city codes, and applicable sections of state law, or the Internal Revenue Code. The distance shall be measured from the front door of the business containing pool and billiard tables, or amusement devises, to the front door of the church, school or day care center, in a straight line. Any existing and licensed business operating at the time of adoption of this section that may be closer than the allowed 500 feet may continue in operation, but shall not be granted a development permit to enlarge or otherwise expand the business, other than normal maintenance and repair. Upon sale, assignment or transfer of such business by the owner or authorized agent thereof, to any other person or entity, such business shall cease and shall not be issued a new or transferred business tax receipt, unless such business were to continue in operation without the pool or billiard parlor, amusement devices or game room.

Any licensed business may seek a special exception to the location of operation, and these hours of operation upon application to department of general services upon compliance with the application form and conditions required by the department. 
(d)  That compliance with these regulations is a precondition to continued operation of a business and its business tax receipt, therefore, a violation of this section as it pertains to hours of operation, occupancy, and sale of alcoholic beverages, or other city codes, may be enforced in the following manner by any law enforcement officer, code officer, or fire chief or his designee: 
(1)  For a first violation, a written warning, signed by the owner, manager or authorized agent of the owner. 
(2)  For a second or subsequent violation, a citation on approved forms used by code enforcement for referral to either the city code board or county court, in the manner provided for in city codes.

(e)  Upon a third or subsequent violation, the business owner or authorized agent thereof may appeal a revocation of business tax receipt to the city council as provided in section 50-41 of the city Code. 
(f)  That the failure of the city to issue citations or enforce this section in any incident shall not be considered a bar to subsequent issuance of penalties by the city as provided herein.

Baldwin, Esq., as testimony on scholarly research regarding an adult business, (Tallahassee, Florida, 1993); "Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin," Texas (1985); "Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis," Indiana (1984); "The Impact of Adult Entertainment Centers on the Community of Tampa, Florida," (1982); "Study of the Effects of the Concentration of Adult Entertainment Establishments in the County of Los Angeles," California (1977); and findings of the county sheriff's department and the state attorney's office detailing the secondary effects of and the potential for criminal activities associated with adult uses. The county further relies upon the findings incorporated in County of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed. 2d 29 (1986); Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed. 2d 310 (1975); Bonnell, Inc. v. Board of Adjustments, 791 P.2d 107 (Okl. App. 1989), and has considered such other public input, research, and legal analysis which the city council relies upon and believes to be relevant to problems associated with adult uses. The city determines that the enactment of a time, place, and manner article regulating and addressing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment uses is an appropriate exercise of the city's home rule power in the interest of the health, peace, safety, morals, and general welfare of the people of the city. Specifically, the city council finds and determines, based upon the foregoing, as follows: 
(1)  Sexually oriented activities, including the sale of adult entertainment material and nude, seminude or topless dancing gives rise to prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution, and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons or property. 
(2)  When the sexual activities described in subsection (1) of this section are actively marketed in commercial establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (1) of this section, and ultimately force residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(3)  The activities described in subsection (1) of this section often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely effecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
(4)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment establishments. 
(5)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at adult entertainment establishments. 
(6)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by allowing adult entertainment establishments to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a permit under this article are so great as to require the permitting of such establishments prior to their being authorized to operate. 
(7)  Requiring operators of adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, expediting the investigation of the transmission of certain communicable and social diseases, and by making it difficult for minors to work in such establishments. 
(8)  Prohibiting adult entertainment establishments from operating within certain distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, libraries, areas zoned or designated for residential use, parks, and other protected areas at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(9)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, or physical contact or touching within adult entertainment establishments poses a threat to the health of both customers and employees and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. Straddle dancing is deemed primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(10)  Adult entertainment establishments involve activities which are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, wherein speech or expressive activity is nonexistent or incidental thereto, and are therefore subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the community. 
(11)  Physical contact or touching within adult entertainment establishments between workers and/or customers, wherein specified anatomical areas are exhibited, poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases.

For any such existing nonconforming uses within the City of Okeechobee, the following standards are imposed for the protection of the city, its citizens and visitors: 
(1)  It is the express policy of the city that junkyards and the placement of junk items, by its nature, constitute an eyesore, and cause environmental hazards that are not acceptable within the City of Okeechobee. Accordingly, and for such non-conforming use, items of junk shall not be placed in open view of the public for display, advertising, sale, or hawking purposes. Any item defined as junk by this ordinance, or state or federal laws, shall be located in an area of the real property no less than a 50-foot set back from the front property line; 20-foot setback from side property lines; and 20-foot set back from rear property lines. The junk shall not be viewable from public rights of way, and shall be obscured from ordinary view of those persons passing upon the highways and municipal rights of way in the City of Okeechobee. If not otherwise obscured by foliage or shrubbery that complies with applicable city codes, the junk shall be obscured by the erection of an opaque fence, with a minimum height of eight feet. Any fence so placed shall not be permitted to encroach into the front property line set backs for the zoning district regardless of other codes to the contrary. The fencing material shall be either constructed of wood, or by hurricane fencing, with plastic slats woven through the fence fabric to make it obscure. Any fence so constructed shall comply with all other applicable city permitting process and codes. 
(2)  In the event the real property on which the junk is located is greater than 100 feet in width from side property line to side property line, there shall be placed a 30-foot unobstructed vehicle access lane from the front property line to the rear property line for ingress and egress for fire and emergency services, and a similar 30-foot lane placed for every additional 100 feet of the width of the real property. 
(3)  Any location meeting the definition of a junkyard under this ordinance or F. S. § 339.241, "Florida Junkyard Control Law", and as hereafter amended, shall be open at all regular business hours for inspection by environmental or law enforcement officers, city code compliance officers, and litter enforcement officer, to determine compliance with this ordinance and state laws. 
(4)  Compliance by a property owner, tenant or agent with these code provisions shall not preclude an action for relief and enforcement by the city under applicable state statutes to enjoin a pubic nuisance, if in the opinion of the city the property and its contents do in fact constitute a public nuisance under state laws or these ordinances. 
(Code 1982, § 8-1; Ord. No. 850, §§ II, III, 1-6-2004) 
Sec. 30-41. - Disabled vehicles. 
    No person in charge or in control of any property within the city, whether an owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or otherwise, shall allow any disabled vehicle to be placed or remain on such property unless such vehicle is within a completely enclosed building or is on the premises of an automotive repair or storage business for which the owner of the business has a current city occupational license and zoning approval. 
(1)  Prima facie evidence. A vehicle will be considered physically or mechanically incapable of being operated on the public streets if it is wrecked, partially dismantled, has no engine, has no transmission, has a dismantled engine or transmission, has no valid current license tag or is in some comparable physical state rendering it inoperable. 
(2)  Interpretation of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting the disassembling, tearing down or scrapping of a vehicle or to permit one vehicle to be scavenged or stripped for parts for use on another vehicle. 
(3)  Responsibility for compliance. The owner, agent and/or tenant of the property on which the violation occurs and the owner of the disabled vehicle shall be jointly and individually responsible for compliance with the requirements of this section.

Sec. 30-42. - Procedure for abandoned or lost property. 
(a)  Whenever a code enforcement officer ascertains that an article of lost or abandoned property is present on public property and is of such nature that it can be easily removed, the officer shall take such article into custody and shall make a reasonable attempt to ascertain the rightful owner or lienholder pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(b)  Whenever a code enforcement officer ascertains that an article of lost or abandoned property is present on public property and is of such nature that it cannot be easily removed, the officer shall cause a notice to be placed upon such article in substantially the following form: 
NOTICE TO THE OWNER AND ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE ATTACHED PROPERTY. This property: (setting forth brief description) is unlawfully upon public property known as (setting forth brief description of location) and must be removed within five days; otherwise, it will be removed and disposed of pursuant to F.S. ch. 705. The owner will be liable for the costs of removal, storage, and publication of notice.

(c)  Such notice shall be not less than eight inches by ten inches and shall be sufficiently weatherproof to withstand normal exposure to the elements. In addition to posting, the law enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain the name and address of the owner. If such is reasonably available to the officer, the officer shall mail a copy of such notice to the owner on or before the date of posting. If the property is a motor vehicle as defined in F.S. § 320.01(1) or a vessel as defined in F.S. § 327.02, the law enforcement agency shall contact the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles in order to determine the name and address of the owner and any person who has filed a lien on the vehicle or vessel as provided in F.S. § 319.27(2) or (3) or F.S. § 328.15(1). On receipt of this information, the law enforcement agency shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner and to the lienholder, if any. If, at the end of five days after posting the notice and mailing such notice, if required, the owner or any person interested in the lost or abandoned articles described has not removed the articles from public property or shown reasonable cause for failure to do so, the following shall apply: 
(1)  For abandoned property, the code enforcement agency may retain any or all of the property for its own use or for use by the city, trade such property to another unit of local government or state agency, donate the property to a charitable organization, sell the property, or notify the appropriate refuse removal service. 
(2)  For lost property, the officer shall take custody and the city shall retain custody of the property for 90 days. The city shall publish notice of the intended disposition of the property, as provided in this section, during the first 45 days of this time period. 
a.  If the city elects to retain the property for use by the city, donate the property to a charitable organization, surrender such property to the finder, sell the property, or trade the property to another unit of local government or state agency, notice of such election shall be given by an advertisement published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property was found if the value of the property is more than $100.00. If the value of the property is $100.00 or less, notice shall be given by posting a description of the property at the law enforcement agency where the property was turned in. The notice must be posted for not less than two consecutive weeks in a public place designated by the law enforcement agency. The notice must describe the property in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the rightful owner of the property to claim it.

Sec. 30-43. - Public nuisances. 
(a)  "Public nuisance" as defined in this section, means the existence of excessive accumulation of litter or untended vegetation, garbage, weeds, or other dead or living plant life; or places holding stagnant water, and all other objectionable, unsightly or unsanitary matter upon any lot, track of land within the city, whether uncovered or under shelter, to the extent and in the manner that such lot or parcel of land is, or may reasonably become infested or inhabited by rodents, vermin or wild animals, or may furnish a breeding place for mosquitoes, or threatens or endangers the public health, safety or welfare, including such condition causing or tending to cause disease, or by reason of such a condition, tends to impair the economic welfare of adjacent property; including abandoned or junk property as defined by this article; unsightly, derelict or unsafe building or structure which may constitute a hazard to safety, health, welfare or sense of public aesthetics by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment. 
(b)  All nuisances are declared to be a public nuisance and illegal within the municipal boundaries of the city, and shall be removed, corrected or otherwise satisfied at the direction of the city as provided in this article. 
(c)  Any nuisance, except such nuisance as would be determined to be an emergency, existing within the city shall be brought before the code enforcement board of the city as provided in F.S. ch. 162. Upon determination by the board that a nuisance does in fact exist, the landowner or custodian thereof shall take whatever corrective measures as directed by the board, within the time period provided by the board. The remedies available to the code enforcement board, in addition to those set forth in F.S. ch. 162, shall include the authority to authorize clean up or repair of the property to come into compliance; to recommend suspension or revocation of an occupational license until the property comes into compliance; and such further remedies as provided by law. If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the nuisance presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or is irreparable or irreversible in nature, he shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator, and may immediately notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. 
(d)  If the owner, agent or person in custody of any property upon which such nuisance should exist, fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the direction of the code enforcement board within the time provided, and such is verified by the code enforcement officer, and the code enforcement officer confirms that the person responsible was noticed of the board action by certified mail, the code enforcement officer is empowered to authorize the property to be cleaned and the nuisance abated by his own agents or authorized contractors. Prior to commencing such abatement, the code enforcement officer shall obtain a reasonable estimate for such abatement and present the estimate to the city administrator for approval. If in the opinion of the city administrator the cost of abatement exceeds the reasonable value of the property or is otherwise not warranted, then enforcement of the order of the code enforcement board may proceed via other available alternatives under law. If abatement is approved, the code enforcement officer, his agents or contractors are authorized to enter upon such property and take whatever remedial measures are necessary to abate the nuisance to comply with the order of the code enforcement board, and to protect the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the city. Notwithstanding this procedure, if the city administrator should determine that the nuisance is in the nature of an emergency or of such an immediate danger or risk to the public as to imminently affect the public health, safety or welfare of the general public, then the city may enter upon such property at any time to take whatever remedial action as is deemed reasonable and necessary to abate the nuisance to ensure the public health and safety. In such instance, the city shall attempt all reasonable means to give the landowner, agent or person in custody of the property advance notice of the proposed actions of the city, although failure to achieve actual notice shall not prevent such abatement. 
(e)  All costs incurred under this section for the abatement of the nuisance, including administrative code enforcement expenses; labor, equipment and material expenses; and any costs reasonably related to the abatement shall be the responsibility of the landowner. The total costs as calculated by the code enforcement officer shall be included in a resolution presented to the city council, who shall levy a special assessment lien against such lot. Such resolution shall describe the landowner, parcel number, legal description of parcel or lot, and provide the total cost assessed. Until payment is made in full, such assessment shall be a legal valid and binding obligation and lien upon the property. The assessment shall become due and payable to the city as of the date of mailing a copy of the resolution by certified mail by the code enforcement officer. Thirty days after mailing, interest shall commence to accrue on the assessment at the rate of 12 percent per annum on any unpaid portion thereof. 
(f)  As soon as possible after the assessment has been levied, a certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded in the official records of the county clerk of court. The lien shall become effective as of the date of filing such copy with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(g)  The property lien created under the provisions of this article, together with interest thereon, may be enforced by civil action, including foreclosure in the appropriate court in the county. The liens created by this article shall be a first lien equal in dignity and priority to a lien for nonpayment of property taxes, on any property against which an assessment of costs to abate the nuisance has been filed, and shall continue in full force from the date of recording until discharged by satisfaction or foreclosure. 
(h)  Notwithstanding the procedures available to the city by this article, the city retains the right and ability to proceed against the lot or parcel for abatement of nuisance by F.S. ch. 60, or any other applicable provision of state laws.

In the case of the sale of a single-family house by a private individual owner who does not reside in such house at the time of the sale or who was not the most recent resident of the house prior to the sale, the exemption granted by this subsection applies only with respect to one sale within any 24-month period.

The sale or rental of any single-family house shall be excepted from the application of this article only if the house is sold or rented: 
a.  Without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesperson or such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings, or of any employee or agent of any such broker, agent, salesperson, or person; and

(2)  Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence. 
(b)  For the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person is deemed to be in the business of selling or renting dwellings if the person: 
(1)  Has, within the preceding 12 months, participated as principal in three or more transactions involving the sale or rental of any dwelling or interest therein; 
(2)  Has, within the preceding 12 months, participated as agent, other than in the sale of his or her own personal residence, in providing sales or rental facilities or sales or rental services in two or more transactions involving the sale or rental of any dwelling or interest therein; or

Nothing in this article prohibits a private club not in fact open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodgings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodgings to its members or from giving preference to its members.

(e)  Any provision of this article regarding familial status does not apply with respect to housing for older persons. 
(f)  As used in this subsection, the term "housing for older persons" means housing: 
(1)  Provided under any state or federal program that the commission determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons, as defined in the state or federal program; 
(2)  Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older; or 
(3)  Intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older that meets the following requirements: 
a.  At least 80 percent of the occupied units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. 
b.  The housing facility or community publishes and adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required under this subsection. If the housing facility or community meets the requirements of subsections (f)(3)a and (f)(3)c of this section and the recorded governing documents provide for an adult, senior, or retirement housing facility or community and the governing documents lack an amendatory procedure, prohibit amendments, or restrict amendments until a specified future date, then that housing facility or community shall be deemed housing for older persons intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older. If those documents further provide a prohibition against residents 16 years of age or younger, that provision shall be construed, for purposes of the Fair Housing Act, to only apply to residents 18 years of age or younger, in order to conform with federal law requirements. Governing documents which can be amended at a future date must be amended and properly recorded within one year after that date to reflect the requirements for consideration as housing for older persons, if that housing facility or community intends to continue as housing for older persons. 
c.

(2)  One or more units are unoccupied, provided that any unoccupied units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of this section. 
(h)  A person shall not be personally liable for monetary damages for a violation of this section if such person reasonably relied in good faith on the application of the exemption under this section relating to housing for older persons. For purposes of this subsection, a person may show good faith reliance on the application of the exemption only by showing that: 
(1)  The person has no actual knowledge that the facility or the community is ineligible, or will become ineligible, for such exemption; and 
(2)  The facility or community has stated formally, in writing, that the facility or community complies with the requirements for such exemption. 
(i)  A facility or community claiming an exemption under this subsection shall register with the commission and submit a letter to the commission stating that the facility or community complies with the requirements of subsections (f)(1)-(3) of this section. The letter shall be submitted on the letterhead of the facility or community and shall be signed by the president of the facility or community. This registration and documentation shall be renewed biennially from the date of original filing. The information in the registry shall be made available to the public, and the commission shall include this information on an internet website. The commission may establish a reasonable registration fee, not to exceed $20.00, that shall be deposited into the commission's trust fund to defray the administrative costs associated with maintaining the registry. The commission may impose an administrative fine, not to exceed $500.00, on a facility or community that knowingly submits false information in the documentation required by this subsection. Such fines shall be deposited in the commission's trust fund. The registration and documentation required by this subsection shall not substitute for proof of compliance with the requirements of this subsection. Failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not disqualify a facility or community that otherwise qualifies for the exemption provided in this subsection. A county or municipal ordinance regarding housing for older persons may not contravene the provisions of this subsection. 
(j)  Nothing in this article: 
(1)  Prohibits a person engaged in the business of furnishing appraisals of real property from taking into consideration factors other than race, color, national origin, sex, handicap, familial status, or religion. 
(2)  Limits the applicability of any reasonable local restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. 
(3)  Requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
(4)  Prohibits conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined under F.S. ch. 893.

    Owner means that person or legal entity reflected on the county public records as the owner of real property upon which a structure has been completed. 
    Public service fee means an annual user charge applicable to all structures certified for occupancy by the city but not appearing on the county tax rolls as an improvement to real property. 
    Structure means any building constructed upon real property located within the municipal limits of the city, which is not exempt from municipal ad valorem taxation under state law. 
(Code 1982, § 15-26) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 50-162. - Purpose and intent of article. 
(a)  Certificate of occupancy is the first step in placing an improvement to real property on the tax rolls. Once the certificate of occupancy is issued, and until such time that the improvement is on the tax rolls so that revenue can be obtained to fund the cost of city services, the city must begin to formally provide city services to the structure. Even before the structure is certified, the city has made available or provided city services. 
(b)  The welfare of the entire city is affected by any improvement to real property. It is in the interest of all taxpayers and citizens that the additional cost of city services be shared by an appropriate standard. 
(c)  The purpose and intent of this article is to provide the additional revenue to expand the city service delivery system to all new certified structures so that the quality of life for all citizens is not adversely affected. 
(d)  The public service fee will: 
(1)  Fund the additional cost related to expanding the delivery system to provide all city services pursuant to the Charter authority granted by article V, section 25. 
(2)  Be related to the cost of expanding the delivery system to meet the increased demands of any improvements; and be no more than what the city would incur in providing the new users with delivery system services. 
(3)  Provide the necessary funds to expand the delivery system due to the additional growth and development in a particular subarea which is not attributable to the public at large. 
(4)  Be deposited in the general fund and be expended to expand the delivery system. 
(Code 1982, § 15-27) 
Sec. 50-163. - Calculation of fees. 
    The public service fee shall be computed annually by the city according to the following criteria: 
(1)  Unreimbursed expense determination, per dwelling unit basis. Upon the receipt of the certified audit for each fiscal year, the city shall total all general fund expenses and reduce that figure by: 
a.  All service revenues; 
b.  All utility taxes and franchise fees; and 
c.  The total of all ad valorem taxes paid and received on vacant land. 
The resulting balance shall then be divided by the average number of dwelling units for the preceding fiscal year so as to arrive at an average annual expense on a per dwelling unit basis. 
(2)  Dwelling unit computation by city; residential, constructive commercial and/or industrial. For the purpose of this subsection, dwelling unit computation shall be completed as follows: 
a.  Each single-family unit, including condominium or apartment unit, shall count as one. 
b.  To arrive at a constructive number of dwelling units for commercial and/or industrial structures, the city shall divide the total building square footage, for each such industrial and/or commercial structure by 2,500 square feet. 
(3)  Fee determination; proration. The average expense per dwelling unit shall then be utilized by the finance department in computing the public service fee applicable to each structure certified for occupancy subsequent to January 1 of each calendar year. Such fee shall be prorated on a per diem basis. 
(4)  Minimum fee. Notwithstanding the fee calculation provided in subsection (3) of this section, the minimum public service fee charged shall be $10.00. 
(Code 1982, § 15-28) 
Sec. 50-164. - Levied. 
    As of the date a certificate of occupancy is issued by the building department, every new structure located within the city shall be subject to a public service fee. This public service fee shall be in effect until that date when the new structure in question appears on the assessment rolls of the county tax assessor's office. 
(Code 1982, § 15-29) 
Sec. 50-165. - Procedure. 
(a)  The zoning administrator shall be charged with the collection of the public service fee which shall be collected as a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the building department. Upon request for a certificate of occupancy, the zoning administrator shall request and receive a statement of the public service fees due and payable for the structure in question from the offices of the city. 
(b)  Such fee shall be presented to the owner of the property and collected prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Subsequent to collection, and in any event on a daily basis, the zoning administrator shall remit monies collected pursuant to this section to the offices of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 15-30) 
Sec. 50-166. - Lien for unpaid public service fees. 
    A lien for all public service fees shall attach to any property as of the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the building department and shall continue in full force and effect until discharged by payment as provided in section 50-164.

ARTICLE IV. - OFF-ROAD VEHICLES 

Sec. 54-121. - Findings and purposes. 
(a)  The city council finds that the driving, riding and use of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters; jeeps or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the limits of the city is and can be the cause of noise and dust and of the destruction of plants, other ecological damage, and damage to landscaping and other personal and real property, which conduct adversely affects the comfort and privacy of occupants and residents of the city. Because such conduct may be intermittent, fleeting, moving and/or caused by persons who are minors, the noise and public nuisance provisions of this Code, as well as other legal remedies, are inadequate to control such conduct and its adverse effects. The provisions of this article relating to the regulations of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters, jeeps or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles are therefore necessary for the public welfare. 
(b)  The city council declares that the purpose of this section is to exercise the general police power in order to protect the enjoyment and use of public and private property, to protect the rights of privacy, to preserve property and personal values, and to promote peace and quiet within the city by regulating the use of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters, jeeps or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the city.

The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the operation of off-highway motor vehicles upon the property of another when such motor vehicles are: 
(1)  Authorized emergency vehicles; 
(2)  Used for ingress to and egress from, and parking upon, parking lots or structures open to the public or private parking lots; 
(3)  Motor vehicles operated upon property used for a motor vehicle riding area which has received approval from the city and is being operated as a business; 
(4)  The property of any governmental agency, including any motor vehicle riding facility operated by the city; 
(5)  Upon property of another and when the operator has the written consent of the owner or person in lawful possession of such property; 
(6)  Used by the owner of the land himself, his family, employees, agents or lessees; 
(7)  Upon private property for ingress and egress only. 
(Code 1982, § 17-51) 
Sec. 54-123. - Prima facie violation. 
    The operation of any motorcycle, motorbike, minibike, dirt bike, trail bike, dune buggy, motor scooter, jeep or other form of off-highway motor vehicle on any vacant or unimproved lands within the city limits shall constitute a prima facie violation of this article unless the operator is able immediately to exhibit signed written permission by the owner of the land for such use.

(a)  A developer may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the City of Okeechobee by making a proportionate fair share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements. 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; and 
(2)  The City of Okeechobee's five-year Community Investment Program (CIP) includes a transportation capital improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(b)  The city may choose to allow a developer to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair share contribution by contributing to an improvement, that upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic, generated by the proposed development, but is not contained in the five year CIP, where one of the following conditions apply: 
(1)  The city adds the improvement to the five year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the comprehensive plan, provided that the improvement is financially feasible as defined by F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)(1); or, 
(2)  If the funds in the five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement, the city may enter into a proportionate fair share agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair share amount is calculated if the proportionate fair share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the city council, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system, provided that improvement(s) is (are) adopted into the five year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Any transportation capital improvement proposed to meet the developer's proportionate fair share obligation must meet the design standards of the City of Okeechobee for city-maintained roads and the design standards of the applicable governmental entity for all other roads. 
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 1-2-2007) 
Sec. 78-206. - Application process. 
(a)  A developer who shall commence any land development activity generating traffic which results in a failure of a road segment to achieve transportation concurrency may apply to the city for a proportionate fair share agreement. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and other relevant issues. If the road segment that has failed to achieve transportation concurrency is on the Strategic Intermodal System, the Florida Department of Transportation shall be requested to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(c)  Procedures for review of application for proportionate fair share agreement. 
(1)  The developer shall submit an application to the city administrator or designee that includes a non-refundable application fee of $5,000.00 and the following: 
a.  Name, address and contact information of the developer; 
b.  A drawing and legal description of the land; 
c.  Phasing schedule; 
d.  Description of the requested fair share mitigation; 
e.  If the requested fair share mitigation involves a road segment on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), evidence of concurrence from the Florida Department of Transportation. 
f.  Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to achieve transportation concurrency. 
(2)  Within 20 days of receipt of the application, the city administrator or designee shall review the application to determine if the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the city administrator or designee shall send a written statement to the developer delineating the deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the developer within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The city administrator or designee, in his or her sole discretion, may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies, provided the developer has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(3)  Once the city administrator or designee determines the application is complete, he shall provide written notification of such to the developer and forward the application to the city attorney who shall, within 30 days, draft a proportionate fair share agreement for consideration by the city council at a meeting no later than 60 days from the date at which the developer received the notification that the application was complete. 
(4)  No proportionate fair share agreement shall be effective until approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 1-2-2007) 
Sec. 78-207. - Determination of proportionate fair share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair share mitigation includes without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and contribution of transportation facilities. 
(b)  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate fair share obligation shall be as provided for pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(12), and as represented by the following formula: 
[Proportionate Fair-Share = [(Development Trips)/(SV Increase)] × Cost] 
Where: 
Development Trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment. 
SV Increase = Service Volume increase provided by the improvement to roadway segment. 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement. 
(c)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair share obligations, improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIP, the Okeechobee County MPO Transportation Improvement Program, or the Florida Department of Transportation Work Program. Where such information is not available, the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the city administrator or designee of costs, adjusted by the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index from the previous year, by cross section type that incorporates date from recent projects; or, 
(2)  The most recent issue of Florida Department of Transportation "Transportation Costs", as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
(d)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(e)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Okeechobee County Property Appraiser or, at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair share obligation for that development, then the developer must also pay the difference. 
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 1-2-2007) 
Sec. 78-208. - Transportation facilities impact fee credit. 
(a)  Proportionate fair share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution is calculated. Additionally, if the proportionate fair share contribution is based on only a portion of the development's traffic, the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fair share contribution is based. 
(b)  At the time the proportionate fair share obligation is being determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the developer's proportionate fair share obligation is less than the development's anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee, then the developer must pay the difference to the city. 
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 1-2-2007) 
Sec. 78-209. - Proportionate fair share agreements. 
(a)  Should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair share agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Payment of the proportionate fair share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to determination of proportionate fair share obligation, and adjusted accordingly. 
(c)  Developer improvements authorized under this article involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements on receipt of a warranty bond. The form of the warranty bond shall be approved by the city attorney. 
(d)  Developer improvements authorized under this article not involving dedications to city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever event first occurs. 
(e)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic. 
(f)  A developer may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee to the city will be non-refundable. 
(Ord. No. 966, § 1, 1-2-2007) 
Sec. 78-210. - Appropriation of fair share revenues. 
(a)  All proportionate fair share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIP, or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate full share agreement. 
(b)  In the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development, as determined by the city council.

(c)  Limitations on authority to grant variances. The city board of adjustment shall base its decisions on variances on technical justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in subsection (g) of this section, the conditions of issuance set forth in subsection (h) of this section, and the comments and recommendations of the floodplain administrator and the building official. The city board of adjustment has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this article. 
(d)  Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in section 82-125(c) of this article. 
(e)  Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(f)  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this article, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section, is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(g)  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the city board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this article, and the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
(5)  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(h)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the city board of adjustment that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Chapter 86 - SUBDIVISIONS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 86-1. - Purpose and intent of chapter. 
(a)  Land subdivision is the first step in community development. Once land has been subdivided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads, drainage and utilities must be maintained and various customary city services must be provided. The welfare of the entire city is directly affected by land subdivision. It is to the interest of all taxpayers and citizens, the developer, and future residents that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound practice and appropriate standards. 
(b)  The intent and purpose of this chapter is to aid in the harmonious development of the city; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic; to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, potable water, flood prevention, drainage, wastewater, other sanitary facilities, and other city services; and to that end to prevent and prohibit the subdivision of land in the city that will not be accomplished in accordance with these regulations. 
(c)  In addition to the design requirements for construction of such required improvements as roads and drainage, as set out in this chapter, compliance with the intent of these regulations require that good design be practiced in subdivision planning, valuable and scenic natural features conserved, and adequate open space be made available for public use. Size, shape and orientation of lots and blocks should be carefully considered with relation to future use of the various lots to be created. 
(d)  It is intended that the regulations of this chapter shall be liberally constructed to accomplish their stated purposes. 
(Ord. No. 669, § 3.00.01, 5-17-1994) 
Sec. 86-2. - Jurisdiction of chapter provisions. 
    The regulations set out in this chapter shall apply to all lands presently within the incorporated limits of the city, and to any lands which may in the future be annexed to and be made a part of the city. No land shall be subdivided, or no building or structure or any part thereof constructed, in any area of the city, after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived unless such subdivision conforms to the provisions of the regulations of this chapter.

The city shall check to determine whether any taxes remain unpaid on the land in question. 
(d)  At a public meeting, the city council will receive reports on and review the preliminary plat and required improvement and construction plans and supplementary materials to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The developer, adjoining owners and other persons interested in or affected by the proposed subdivision shall have a right to be heard in person, by letter, or by agent or attorney before action is taken by the city council. 
(e)  The city council may conditionally accept the preliminary plat and approve the required construction and improvement plans and supplementary materials as presented, or with minor modifications, if found to be in compliance with this chapter, or may refuse to accept the preliminary plat and required construction and improvements plans supplementary materials when not found to be in compliance with, or readily capable of being revised to comply with, this chapter. If the council refuses to accept the preliminary plat and required construction and improvement plans and supplementary materials, the council shall state in writing the particular basis for the refusal, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the developer. 
(f)  At this stage, the city council, with the aid of the city administrator and appropriate city departments, shall, if conditional acceptance of the preliminary plat and required construction and improvement plans and supplementary materials is given, work out an agreement with the developer to include, but not to be limited to, provisions for carrying out the required construction and improvements to completion and the developing of the subdivision stages, if the proposed subdivision is to be a large one and the council shall find that development in stages is consistent with the intent and purposes of this chapter.

(d)  Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(e)  Where a subdivision abuts on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with a decorative block wall contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. Where a decorative block wall is approved, such wall shall be designed and constructed to be a minimum of five feet in height with stucco surface painted and be in conformance with the landscape requirements of this subpart B. 
(f)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the city council may require a marginal access street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Distances involving rights-of-way shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(g)  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely placed in the city under conditions approved by the city council. 
(h)  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided, except where topographic situations make this provision impractical. 
(i)  A tangent at least 250 feet long shall be introduced between curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(j)  When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than 150 feet for local streets, 300 feet for collector streets, and 500 feet for arterial streets. 
(k)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than a 75 degree angle. 
(l)  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of ten feet, or of a greater radius where the city council may deem it necessary. The city council may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners. 
(m)  There shall be no private streets or easements for street use platted in any subdivision without the specific approval of the city council. Where the city council approves private streets, the council shall ensure that adequate, provision is made for the initial installation and future maintenance of such streets, to the end that such streets shall not become a future charge upon the city. Private streets shall be designed and constructed to the specifications of the public works manual. 
(n)  Street right-of-way width shall be as provided in section 86-4. 
(o)  Sight distances shall be as provided in the public works manual. The plat should indicate setback requirements on any street where they would be applicable.

Where a subdivision abuts on or contains an existing street of inadequate right-of-way width, additional rights-of-way in conformity with the standards of this section shall be required for new subdivisions. 
(p)  Half or partial streets shall be prohibited. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(q)  Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be prohibited except when designed as culs-de-sac. Such streets shall be as provided in the public works manual without special permission of the city council, where due to unusual circumstances involving larger designs or topographical conditions a greater length may be deemed necessary. 
(r)  Street names and lots numbers shall conform to the street naming and lot numbering plan of the city. 
(s)  Street grades shall be determined in relation to the drainage installations for the subdivision. Wherever feasible, street grades shall not exceed five percent or less than one-half of one percent, unless otherwise approved by the city.

(b)  Permanent control points shall be set at such locations in the subdivisions as specified by F.S. § 177.091(8), and by the city. Permanent control points shall meet the standards specified in F.S. § 177.031(13). 
(c)  All lot line boundaries shall be monumented as specified in F.A.C. ch. 61G-17. 
(d)  The location of all monuments under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall be indicated on the final plat. 
(e)  All original corner markers shall be protected throughout the development. Should such, or any, monuments, iron pipes, or iron pins serving as monuments, fall within pavements, driveways or sidewalks they shall be secured to proposed grades by eight-inch concrete pipes and a cast iron cap for access to the original monument. All monuments must be in place before the developer is released from bond, if a bond has been posted. If no bond is posted, monuments must be in place prior to the approval of the final plat. Any and all land monuments, subject to being disturbed or destroyed in the prosecution of construction, shall be accurately witnessed before construction and replaced at the expense of the developer upon the completion of construction. 
(Ord. No. 669, § 3.07.01, 5-17-1994) 
Sec. 86-182. - Storm drainage. 
(a)  A drainage system shall be designed showing the ultimate disposition of the design storm. All stormwater conveyance systems shall have adequate capacity to carry the runoff resulting from rainfall intensity which maybe expected for a ten-year storm period. Stormwater treatment and disposal facilities shall be designed for a 25-year storm event of 24-hour duration. Such facilities shall meet the design and performance standards established in F.A.C. 17-25.025. The first inch of stormwater runoff shall be treated on-site, pursuant to F.A.C. 17-3.051. Stormwater discharge facilities shall be designed such that the receiving water body shall not be degraded below minimum conditions necessary to ensure the suitability of water for the designated use of its classification as established in F.A.C. ch. 17-3. These standards shall apply to all development and redevelopment. Where there is substantial diversion of water, such diversion shall be accomplished so as to prevent erosion. 
(b)  All drainage facilities shall be designed for a positive outfall to existing storm wastewater systems, lakes, canals, rivers, streams, or previously constructed city, county or state road ditches. All water retention areas shall be fenced and shall be screened by appropriate trees or shrubbery. 
(c)  If the added runoff from the developed area will, in the judgment of the city, overtax or overload the existing public stormwater system or roadway, then the developer shall include in his plans sufficient work to enlarge the present facilities to care for the added drainage imposed on the system. 
(d)  Where land is subject to periodic flooding by the overflow from creeks, rivers, or streams, a floodplain based on a 25-year, 24-hour storm must be established and clearly designated on the final plat. No building will be permitted within the area of the floodplain unless the entire area to be utilized for building is filled to a height of three feet above the floodplain and proposed filling as approved by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). 
(e)  Areas to be used for water retention purposes shall be designated as "general purpose areas" on the plat and shall not be shown on the plat in any other way. Such areas shall in no circumstances be given a lot designation in the subdivision. Such areas shall be held in common ownership and maintained by the property owners' association. Such property owners' association shall be provided for in the protective covenants specified in section 86-72, with provisions that provide for maintenance of retention areas and assessment of property owners by the city if the property owners' association fails to adequately maintain such water retention areas. If the city council agrees to accept the dedication of the water retention areas, they shall be deeded as general purpose areas in a given block, as the case may be. 
(f)  Drainage facilities and necessary auxiliary improvements such as fencing and screening must be constructed and approved before the developer is released from bond, if a bond has been posted. If no bond is posted, drainage facilities must be constructed and approved by the city before the approval of the final plat. 
(g)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, compliance with all SFWMD regulations is also required, and the most restrictive condition between SFWMD and city requirements shall be accomplished.

    Standards for installation of water, wastewater and storm wastewater are as follows: 
(1)  Installation of any water and wastewater system shall comply with appropriate state regulations and standard specifications provided in the Public Utilities Manual and the Manual of Standards and Design Construction and Maintenance for Water and Wastewater Systems, and shall be installed under the direction and supervision of, and subject to the inspection and approval of, the city. If any defects shall occur in the water or sanitary wastewater facilities within one year from the date of acceptance by the city, such defects shall be remedied and corrected at the developer's expense. The specifications and location of fire hydrants shall be approved by the city. 
(2)  All necessary storm drainage facilities, either underground pipe, drainage wells, canals, or drainage ditches, shall be installed to city standards and specifications, and subject to the approval of the city, so as to provide adequate disposal of surface water and to maintain any natural watercourses. In areas where high groundwater exists and it is deemed necessary by the city for the protection of paved streets, underdrains shall be installed. If any defects shall occur in the storm drainage system within one year from the date of acceptance by the city, such defects shall be remedied and corrected at the developer's expense. 
(3)  Installations for water, wastewater and storm drainage shall be installed as specified in this subpart B. 
(Ord. No. 669, § 3.07.05, 5-17-1994) 
Sec. 86-186. - Streets. 
(a)  All streets and public ways shall be cleared and graded to their full width of right-of-way and to the established and approved grade as set out in section 86-183. If required to prevent erosion or excessive washing, protective measures shall be taken by the developer as required by the city. 
(b)  All streets shall be paved to the minimum applicable standard specified in the public works manual.

ARTICLE II. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 90-31. - Applicability of article provisions. 
    The regulations of this article shall apply to nonconforming lots, uses, structures and signs. 
(LDR 1998, § 750) 
Sec. 90-32. - Development of nonconforming lot. 
(a)  Residential lot in separate ownership. A lot in a residential zoning district which is nonconforming because of insufficient area, which has at least 4,000 square feet and 40 feet frontage, and was in separate ownership on the date of enactment of these regulations, may be used to build a single-family dwelling. 
(b)  Nonresidential lot in separate ownership. A lot nonconforming because of insufficient area, which was in separate ownership on the date of enactment of these regulations, may be used, provided that all other zoning district regulations are complied with. No use that requires a lot area greater than the district minimum lot area is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(c)  Contiguous lots. When three or more vacant nonconforming lots with continuous frontage are in single ownership, they shall be resubdivided in such a manner as will make them conforming lots. If resubdivision to eliminate nonconforming lots is impossible, application shall be made for a variance prior to development of the lots. This subsection shall not apply to contiguous nonconforming lots in single ownership if a majority of the lots on the street or within 500 feet of such lot in the same zoning district are also nonconforming. 
(d)  Creation of nonconforming lot. No division of land shall be made which creates a lot or parcel which does not meet the minimum lot requirements for the zoning district in which such lot or parcel is located. 
(LDR 1998, § 751) 
Sec. 90-33. - Completion of nonconforming project. 
(a)  Completion of approved project. Nonconforming projects that were approved prior to enactment of these regulations may be completed in accordance with terms of their permits, provided that the permits remain valid. 
(b)  Completion of phased projects. Projects which are approved and developed in phases shall be completed in accordance with conditions of approval. Phases which have not received final approval shall conform to the requirements of these regulations. 
(LDR 1998, § 752) 
Sec. 90-34. - Continuation of nonconforming use and structure. 
(a)  A lawful nonconforming use or structure, existing on the enactment date of the regulations from which this article is derived, may be continued subject to restrictions and qualifications set forth in this article. 
(b)  Special regulations for adult entertainment are as follows: 
(1)  An adult entertainment establishment in existence at the time this chapter became effective and is located in violation of this chapter, may continue to operate for a period of one year from the date this chapter became effective, and shall cease operation immediately upon the expiration of such period. 
(2)  An adult entertainment establishment becoming operational after the effective date of this chapter which had legal rights vesting with respect to such establishments location arising from a judicial declaration construing any ordinance in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter, may operate for a period of one year, notwithstanding that it may be located in an area otherwise prohibited by section 90-343(10). The adult entertainment establishment shall cease operation immediately upon the expiration of such period. 
(3)  When a nonconforming use of an adult entertainment establishment has been discontinued for 90 consecutive days or more for any reason, the nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned, and the future use of the premises or site shall revert only to those uses permitted on the site on which the establishment is located. 
(LDR 1998, § 753) 
Sec. 90-35. - Change or transfer of nonconforming use or structure. 
(a)  Change. A nonconforming use or structure may be changed to a conforming use or structure for the district in which it is located. Once changed to a conforming use or structure, no building, structure or land use shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use. 
(b)  Transfer of nonconforming commercial use. In the event the underlying lands on which exists a nonconforming use in a commercial, commercial business district, commercial professional office, or industrial zoning category within the city is sold, assigned, or in any manner transferred from the record title holder of said lands, as such ownership is reflected in the records of the Clerk of Court or Property Appraiser for Okeechobee County, such nonconforming use shall cease, and not be permitted to likewise be transferred, and the nonconforming use shall extinguish. Any such future use of said lands subsequent to transfer shall be in compliance with all current City Codes, and land use regulations applicable to such zoning or land use designation. Excluded from this prohibition is the transfer of ownership of said lands to a corporation, professional association or limited liability company recognized under Florida law whose majority stockholder is the same person as the previous record owner. 
(c)  Transfer of a nonconforming residential use. In the event the underlying lands on which exists a nonconforming use in a residentially zoned category within the city is sold, assigned, or in any manner transferred from the record title holder of said lands, as such ownership is reflected in the records of the Clerk of Court or Property Appraiser for Okeechobee County, such nonconforming use may continue thereafter in such use, so long as such use is residential in nature. However, such nonconforming residential use shall not thereafter be expanded, enlarged or increase in intensity of use, so long as the use remains nonconforming under City Codes. Additionally, such nonconforming residential use shall not be permitted to continue if the structure does not conform to fire safety code; health codes; Florida Building Codes; or fails to comply with F.S. ch. 381 regarding migrant housing. 
(d)  Transfer of a nonconforming structure. In the event of the underlying land on which exists a nonconforming structure is sold, assigned or in any manner transferred from the record title holder of said lands, as such ownership is reflected in the records of the Clerk of Court, and Property Appraiser for Okeechobee County, such nonconforming structure may continue in the new owner, so long as the land is not a nonconforming use, and the nonconforming structure is not expanded or repaired except as authorized in these regulations. The transfer of such nonconforming structure is further subject to the requirement that the new owner must comply, to the extent reasonably possible, considering the nature and configuration of the structure, with all current codes, land use and zoning requirements, except off-street parking requirements, of the district regulations applicable to the structure. Provided however: 
(1)  That, if by physical evidence such as photographs or aerial photography, it becomes evident to the city that portions of the property have been used for off-street parking but are unpaved or unimproved, unmarked or otherwise do not meet the city's design requirements for such parking, the owner shall improve the quality of such area (or its dimensional equivalent) with "pavers" or other form of dustless surface acceptable to the city for the purposes of vehicular parking. The number of spaces to be provided shall be equal to that which can be accommodated within the geographic area previously used for parking with said spaces and interior circulation components meeting the city's minimum design requirements for off-street parking and vehicular use areas. 
(2)  That, as a result of the operation of the business on the site, the city determines that parking has been or is occurring off-site in a manner that is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of its residents or has detrimental effects upon the economic well-being of the surrounding nonresidential area, and that there is adequate vacant land on the site to accommodate some or all of the required off-street parking for the business, the owner of the property shall provide, to the extent reasonably possible, the number and type of off-street parking required in the land development regulations. 
(3)  That, if the use of the property or structure under the new owner is different from the prior use such that application of section 90-512, space regulations, results in a greater number of off-street parking spaces being required than the number of off-street parking spaces required of the prior owner and use, the new owner shall provide parking facilities in complete conformance with the land development regulations as if the use were entirely new.

Sec. 90-36. - Discontinuance of nonconforming use. 
    When a nonconforming use has been discontinued or abandoned for a period of a year, any future use of the property shall be either, a permitted use within the district regulations, or after approval a special exception use permitted in the district. 
(LDR 1998, § 755) 
Sec. 90-37. - Discontinued use of nonconforming structure. 
    When a nonconforming structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period for a year, any future use of the property shall comply with the following: 
(1)  Use. Future use shall be either a permitted use within the district or, after approval, a special exception use permitted in the district. 
(2)  Nonconformity. Future use shall not increase the extent of nonconformity by reason of insufficient yards, setbacks, landscaping or parking, or excessive floor area, coverage or height. 
(LDR 1998, § 756) 
Sec. 90-38. - Expansion of nonconforming use. 
(a)  Expansion of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Expansion of a conforming use to any part of a nonconforming use shall not be deemed an expansion of such nonconforming use. 
(b)  Increase in intensity of nonconforming use. Increase in the volume of business, intensity or frequency of property use at a nonconforming use is permitted. Change in the equipment or processes used in a nonconforming use is permitted, provided that it amounts only to changes in the degree of acclivity rather than changes in kind. 
(c)  Nonconforming use of open land. A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except for a quarry use. 
(d)  Moving a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be moved to another part of the property. 
(LDR 1998, § 757) 
Sec. 90-39. - Extension or moving of nonconforming structure. 
(a)  Extension of nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged, improved, or be brought up to current codes without concern as to whether the existing nonconformity deals with lack of off-street parking, or on-site water retention, excessive floor area, height or landscaping, as may be otherwise required of a new structure in these regulations, so long as such development does not create a nonconforming use in that district; does not create a new nonconformity as to property line setbacks; and would not cause or create a significant impact as to drainage and off-street loading requirements. Provided, however, that if the enlargement or improvement, because of application of the provisions of section 90-512, space regulations, results in a greater number of off-street parking spaces being required than the number of off-street parking spaces required before the improvement, the owner shall provide parking facilities in complete conformance with the land development regulations as if the use were entirely new. 
(b)  Extension of nonconforming dwelling. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a single-family or two-family nonconforming dwelling may be enlarged, so long as the enlargement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yards, floor area, coverage, height parking or landscaping requirements. 
(c)  Moving a nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, unless by moving, the structure is made to conform to district regulations or reduce the extent to nonconformity. 
(LDR 1998, § 758; Ord. No. 816, § 1, 2-4-2003; Ord. No. 1036, § 1, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 90-40. - Repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structure or use. 
(a)  Repair or reconstruction of nonconforming structure or use. A nonconforming structure may be maintained, repaired or altered, without concern as to whether the existing nonconformity deals with lack of off-street parking, or on site water retention, excessive floor area, height or landscaping, so long as such repair does not create a new nonconforming use in that district; does not create new or additional nonconformity as to property line setbacks; height, or floor area, and would not create a significant impact as to drainage and off-street loading requirements. Provided, however, that if the repair or alteration, because of application of the provisions of section 90-512, space regulations, results in a greater number of off-street parking spaces being required than the number of off-street parking spaces required before the improvement, the owner shall provide parking facilities in complete conformance with the land development regulations as if the use were entirely new. 
(b)  Reconstruction after catastrophe. A nonconforming structure but not nonconforming use, that is damaged or by any catastrophic means, may be repaired and restored to a safe, sanitary and usable condition, so long as the structure was not totally destroyed, and a development permit authorizing such repair and replacement is issued and construction commences within twelve months of such catastrophe. 
(c)  Reconstruction of nonconforming dwelling. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single-family or two-family nonconforming dwelling may be reconstructed or replaced within two years, so long as the reconstruction does not create new nonconformities, nor increase the extent of the existing nonconformities with respect to yards, floor area, coverage, height, parking or landscaping requirements. Except that in the case of a nonconforming mobile home, the replacement option is permitted only one time on each lot. In the case of a nonconforming mobile home, no replacement option shall be permitted, unless such replacement meets all current codes, land use zoning and district regulations. 
(d)  Compliance required where possible. In reconstructing a nonconforming structure or use, the owner shall comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of the district regulations applicable to the use.

DIVISION 14. - REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PUD-M AND PUD-R DISTRICTS 

Sec. 90-428. - General development review standards. 
    The following general standards shall be utilized in evaluating and establishing conditions for PUD-M and PUD-R zoning districts and in reviewing conceptual and final site plans: 
(1)  Physical characteristics of the site. The property shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazard to persons or property, on or off the site. Conditions of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and topography shall be appropriate to both type and pattern of use intended. 
(2)  Compatibility and relationship to adjacent property. The approval process of development in PUD-M and PUD-R districts shall take into consideration the existing uses and development adjacent to the district. The development shall be designed and located so as to avoid incompatibility with adjacent development or land uses to the extent reasonably possible. This shall be determined by requiring the applicant/developer to provide documentation that the location, design, and final site plan, as reflected in the eventual PUD-M or PUD-R ordinance, will result in a development that is consistent with sound planning principles and complies with all applicable ordinances and land development regulations. The PUD-M and PUD-R zoning categories contemplate, contrary to traditional zoning categories, innovative design and land use, including a mix of uses, with amenities, recreation areas and common areas, and use of zero lot lines. Regardless, the approval process will address compatibility with neighboring zoning categories, including that the overall density, height and location of buildings and improvements, traffic flow, drainage and retention, and overall impact of a PUD-M or PUD-R project, should not materially affect the nature of land uses enjoyed on adjacent properties. 
Developments in PUD-M or PUD-R districts shall include additional screening, buffering, transitional uses or other design features, as necessary, to adequately protect existing or probable uses of surrounding property. 
Opaque durable fencing, masonry walls, or a vegetative screen that is continuous within one year after time of planting, shall be provided at the periphery of PUD-M and PUD-R districts to protect occupants from undesirable views, lighting, noise or other off-site influences, and to protect occupants of adjoining properties from similar adverse influences. 
This provision gives consideration to the site's advantages and limitations, as well as the compatibility of the development to adjacent sites. The design of the site should consider all existing features, both natural and man-made, to determine those inherent qualities that give the site and surrounding area its character. 
(3)  Access and internal circulation. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled access and turning movements and minimize hazards to vehicular and pedestrian safety. The interior circulation system shall be designed to provide for safe and efficient motorized and non-motorized (e.g., bicycles) vehicular and pedestrian movement, as appropriate to the character of the proposed development. 
Vehicular access to streets or portions of streets from off-street parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel traffic from and to such areas conveniently, safely, and in a manner which minimizes friction and excessive interruptions, and promotes vehicular and pedestrian safety. 
(4)  Streets, drives, parking and service areas. Streets, drives, parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to all buildings and general facilities. 
(5)  Natural and historic features. Developments in a PUD-M or PUD-R district shall be designed to preserve natural features of the land and historic resources, such as existing trees, natural topography, and historic and archeological sites, as much as possible. Natural resources and natural features may not be impaired or destroyed unless it is in the public interest to do so. In determining whether such action is in the public interest, the benefit which would reasonably be expected shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the activity. 
(6)  Density. Density shall not exceed maximums established in the comprehensive plan and shall be established after consideration of criteria in the comprehensive plan, neighborhood compatibility, and site design. 
(7)  Screening of trash and refuse containers. All central refuse, trash and garbage collection containers, or those serving multiple dwelling units, shall be screened from sight or located in a such a manner so as not to be visible from any public area within or adjacent to the PUD-M or PUD-R district. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 7-3-2007) 
Sec. 90-429. - Petition requirements for rezoning to a PUD-M or PUD-R district. 
    A petition form provided by the city shall be filled out and submitted along with a written statement describing the nature and intent of the proposed development. The petition package shall include the following:

(5)  A phasing plan if applicable, including a time frame for the completion of each phase and for the entire development. 
(6)  An "as built" map of the site indicating the boundaries of the subject property and indicating all streets, buildings, water courses and other important features. 
(7)  A description, and a map identifying the location, of all environmentally sensitive lands, wetlands, significant areas of native vegetation, and wildlife habitat. 
(8)  A preliminary traffic impact analysis and discussion of the availability or proposed construction of necessary transportation facilities by proposed phase to verify that adequate capacity currently exists or will exist prior to issuance of any certificates of occupancy. 
(9)  A preliminary analysis on the impact on schools. 
(10)  A discussion of the proposed or anticipated sources of potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste disposal and other utilities and the availability of such utilities based on projected residential and nonresidential demand. 
(11)  A list of required regional, state or federal permits or approvals. 
(12)  Documentation demonstrating that new growth associated with the project will occur in an area where public facilities exist, are planned within the city or county five-year capital improvements plan, or are committed to through a developer agreement, or otherwise assured to be funded by the appropriate agency. 
(13)  A fiscal impact study of the proposed project demonstrating net fiscal benefit to the city (PUD-M only). 
(14)  Other written or graphic materials, such as architectural elevations, may be submitted to convey or clarify the nature, character, intent or other attributes of the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 7-3-2007) 
Sec. 90-430. - Other requirements and conditions. 
(a)  All plans, maps, surveys, documents and the like required as part of the petition may be submitted in large format or in binders where appropriate for review and presentation purposes, but shall also be submitted in a reproducible format for distribution to review bodies unless a sufficient number of copies is provided.

DIVISION 5. - SIGNS 

Sec. 90-561. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is widely recognized that the City of Okeechobee is a predominantly rural community, with reputation as an area comprised of agricultural uses, along with residential and light commercial activities. The city has traditionally permitted advertisement within the city, appropriate to the use or purpose, while attempting to preserve and maintain the natural look and character of the city as a quiet and visitor-friendly community for those wishing to enjoy the atmosphere of a small town. 
    The city council recognizes that there are various persons and entities that have an interest in communicating with the public through the use of signs that serve to identify businesses and services, residences and neighborhoods, and also to provide for expression of opinion. The council is also responsible for furthering the city's obligation to its residents and visitors to maintain a safe and aesthetically pleasing environment where signs do not create excessive visual clutter and distraction or hazards for pedestrian and vehicles; where signs do not adversely impact the predominantly residential character of the city, and where signs do not conflict with the natural and scenic qualities of the city. It is the intent of the city council that the regulations contained in this article shall provide uniform sign criteria, which regulate the size, height, number and placement of signs in a manner that is compatible to the residential scale and character of the city, and which shall place the fewest possible restrictions on personal liberties, property rights, free commerce, and the free exercise of constitutional rights, while achieving the city's goal of creating a safe, healthy, attractive and aesthetically pleasing environment that does not contain excessive clutter or visual distraction from rights-of-way and adjacent properties; the surrounding natural rural environment and residential neighborhoods.

(n)  Documentation. Documentation to demonstrate conformance with the requirement of this section shall be submitted by the applicant with all requests to construct, locate or modify a communication tower/antenna. A statement by the applicant as to how construction of the communication tower will accommodate collocation of additional antennas for future users shall be included within the documentation. 
(o)  Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of a tower for sign or advertising purposes including, without limitation, company name, banner, or streamer is prohibited. 
(p)  Abandonment. If the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the zoning official who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the communication tower owner/operator regarding the active use of the tower. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days within which to: 
(1)  Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or 
(2)  Dismantle and remove the tower. The owner of the real property shall be ultimately responsible for all costs of dismantling and removal, and if the tower is not removed within 180 days of abandonment, the city may proceed to do so and assess the costs against the real property. The lien of such assessment shall bear interest, have priority and be collectable at the same rate and in like manner as provided for special assessments by state law. At the earlier of 181 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any special exception, waiver and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
(q)  Finished color. Communication towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall be painted a noncontrasting flat blue, gray, or black finish. The color should be selected so as to minimize the equipment's visibility. 
(r)  Certification of compliance with FCC. Certification of compliance with current Federal Communication Commission (FCC) nonionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER) shall be submitted prior to receiving final inspection by the building department.

APPENDIX D - CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT BUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES 
RESOLUTION NO. 98-12 
    These building design guidelines provide information to assist the building designer to integrate public and commercial buildings within the urban landscape. 
    They are intended to encourage creation of a high quality environment for business, work and shopping areas, and alert architects, engineers, and developers to features that should be given careful consideration during project development. The building design guidelines contain no mandatory requirements. 
1.  Overall building design. 
a.  Buildings should have a strong unified architectural image, and all sides of buildings, signs, fences, landscaping, lighting, walks, and other amenities should be detailed consistently. 
b.  Building forms should be appropriate for the south central Florida climate, incorporating overhangs for shading, and provision for natural building ventilation and air movement. 
c.  Projects should be planned and designed to be compatible with adjacent well-designed buildings and urban landscape. 
d.  Where a historical architectural style is used, it should be consistent in detailing and materials. 
e.  There should be an honest expression in construction and design, achieved through proper use of building forms, quality materials, and judicious use of color and textures. 
2.  Building massing and relationships. 
a.  Buildings should be related to human scale and should not be planned as one large unarticulated mass. 
b.  Building forms and elements should be related to corresponding elements on adjacent buildings. Major horizontal features, windows, floor and roof levels, arcades, and canopies should recognize adjacent building alignments. The rhythm of major vertical elements, column bays, and windows in fine existing buildings should be echoed in new buildings. 
c.  Covered arcades, canopies, and exterior courts should be incorporated to improve livability in the Florida climate, to reduce apparent building mass, and to add interest. 
3.  External building materials. 
a.  Building construction materials. Construction materials should be of lasting quality, properly used, installed and maintained. Facing brick and stone (each of fairly uniform color), textured concrete, terra cotta, and stucco on masonry are acceptable primary building materials for public and commercial structures. Fake, imitation and nondurable materials should not be used. Canvas canopies and awnings may be used, provided they are properly maintained and replaced before they deteriorate. 
b.  Wall treatment. Window and door unites should be well scaled quality fixtures; bronze, anodized aluminum, and hardwood units are recommended. Extensive areas of reflective glass window wall, vinyl, plastic, metal and wood siding, and jalousie windows should be avoided. 
c.  Roof treatment. Low pitched sloping roofs with clay tiles are recommended where appropriate to the building use. Flat roofs may be used, provided all mechanical equipment is concealed from public view. 
d.  Paving treatment. Modular paving materials are recommended over monolithic surfaces for pedestrian areas. Paving modules should be designed to accommodate lighting units, seating, trash receptacles, trees, planters, drains and similar items. Textured and colored paving surfaces such as clay brick pavers, (not facing bricks) are recommended rather than smooth and grey finishes. Paving materials on private property may vary from, but should complement, adjacent public and private walkways in pattern and texture. Pedestrian paving materials and patterns should be used to identify crosswalks in parking lots. 
e.  Color and texture. Overall building colors schemes should be compatible with adjacent quality buildings. Light and pastel colors should predominate, darker accent colors may be used to add definition and interest around elements such as door and window openings. Where feasible, texture and color should be an integral part of the building material. Strongly textured permanent materials and decorative clay product are recommended. Polished stainless steel, reflective mirror glass and similar glare producing materials should not be used extensively. Highly contrasting patterned color schemes in black and white or red and white, (for example, schemes reminiscent or motor speedway tracks), should be avoided as they are a visual disruption in the urban landscape. 
4.  Pedestrian circulation features and amenities. 
a.  Pedestrian circulation should be barrier free and ramps are to be provided for the handicapped, in accord with Florida regulations. Pedestrian circulation should be planned and integrated in design with adjacent projects. 
b.  Commercial building, first floor level facades should be attractive and provide visual interest, with shop windows, display units, entrances, and public amenities. Large areas of blank walls are to be avoided. No more than 30 percent of the first floor building elevation adjacent to a public walkway should be solid wall. 
c.  Pockets of dead space along shopping streets are to be avoided. Where exterior courts or major building facade setbacks occur, entrances should be provided. 
d.  Arcades, canopies and awnings should be provided along pedestrian walks for sun and rain protection. They should be at least eight feet wide, with a clear head room of nine feet. They should be permanent design elements, but may have movable and replaceable components. 
e.  Public amenities such as fixed seating in shaded areas, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, xeriscape drought tolerant landscaping, lighting units, water features, sculpture, information directories, should be provided. 
5.  Lighting. 
a.  Architectural, safety, emergency and security lighting, should be integrated into the building design. 
b.  Pedestrian lighting should safely illuminate walkways, either from light standards or from lower level, vandal resistant, accent lights, set at a uniform height. 
c.  Low intensity landscape lighting may be used. 
d.  Automatic security lighting should illuminate all areas around the building and should not create shadow pockets. 
e.  Lighting should be directed away from streets and adjacent property and should not create annoying glare. 
f.  Energy efficient lighting equipment should be used. Metal halide are recommended to be used in pedestrian areas and high pressure sodium in parking areas. 
g.  White light is recommended, and multicolored lighting is to be avoided, especially when it might conflict with traffic signals. 
6.  Service facilities and mechanical equipment. 
a.  Service entrances and service disposal facilities should be screened from view, and should be located so as not to disrupt pedestrian movement. 
b.  Mechanical equipment and utility services should be located and screened so as not to be visible from public areas adjacent property. 
c.  Noise from mechanical services should not be apparent in outside public areas. 
d.  Power and communications transmission liens [lines] should be underground in public areas. 
e.  Provision should be made for natural ventilation and air circulation, to reduce energy costs and noise. 
f.  Window air conditioning units should not be used.

Minor construction or maintenance work, such as installation of water meters (up to two inches), cable splice pits (not in or within two feet of a roadway) street light or traffic signal maintenance, or similar types of work may be done without permit or prior notice to the department of public works. This is not to be construed as including cable replacement or any other type of facility upgrading or rehabilitation involving excavation, except for splice pits as mentioned above. 
1.2.2. For work inside of existing manholes within the right-of-way, permission shall be obtained from the department of public utilities. 
1.3. Emergency work. None of the above permit procedures shall apply to emergency repair work in the public rights-of-way. Emergency repair work is defined, for the purposes of this document, as that which must be done immediately upon discovery, in order to safeguard the public from immediate danger to life or limb, to safeguard public health or welfare or to restore interrupted utility services. In the event of an emergency as defined above, repair work may be started without a permit upon verbal notification being given to the department of public works. If the department of public works offices are closed, then notification must be given as early as possible on the next regular work day. After the emergency repair is completed and the right-of-way is restored, a record drawing must be submitted to the department of public works, unless otherwise provided hereinafter, within ten working days. Work that can be scheduled ahead of time will not be considered emergency work. 
2. - General requirements. 
2.1. Availability of approved plans and permit. A set of plans for the project, bearing the department of public work's approval stamp must be located on the job-site whenever work is in progress. When applicable, a department of public works construction permit must also be available at the site when work is in progress. 
2.2. Ownership of facilities. All facilities within the public rights-of-way must be owned and maintained by a public service utility or franchisee or by a political entity competent to function within the State of Florida, and shall remain the liability of the last operating entity until removed. This section shall not apply to facilities required to be left in place by the department of public works. 
2.3. Underground facilities. All underground and in-ground facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be designed and installed so as to safely sustain any vehicular loads that might be placed upon them. 
2.3.1. Prior to placing any underground facility in the public right-of-way, unless otherwise approved by the department of public works, the permittee shall remove all muck and other deleterious material existing within the zone extending from the ground level to the horizontal plane four feet below the facility's intended location and from the vertical plane four feet beyond one side of the facility's intended location to the vertical plane four feet beyond the opposite side of facility's intended location. If so doing would endanger an existing facility, contractor shall demuck only that area which can be done without endangerment. 
2.3.2. The requirements of section 2.3.1., above, shall not be mandatory for direct burial cables or conduits for cables, but any cable or conduits for cables so placed shall be subject to the provisions of section 2.3.3., below.

This shall apply to field changes as well as conflict structures proposed in the design of the project in question. 
5. - Hot bituminous mixtures. 
5.1. Weather limitations. 
5.1.1. Limitations of laying operations; general. The mixture shall be spread only when the surface upon which it is to be laid has been previously prepared, is intact, firm and properly cured, and is dry. Unless otherwise approved by the department of public works, no mixture shall be spread that cannot be finished and compacted during daylight hours. 
5.1.2. Temperature. The mixture shall be spread only when the air temperature (the temperature in the shade away from artificial heat) is above 40 degrees F and is not dropping. 
5.1.3. Wind. The mixture shall not be spread when the wind is blowing to such an extent that proper and adequate compaction cannot be maintained or when sand, dust, etc., are being deposited on the surface being paved, to the extent that the bond between layers will be diminished. 
5.2. Preparation of asphalt cement. The asphalt cement shall be heated in advance of the mixing operations, to within a range of 270 degrees F to 350 degrees F. Heating within these limits shall be constant and wide fluctuations of temperature during the days' production will not be permitted. 
5.3. Preparation of aggregates. 
5.3.1. Stockpiles. Each aggregate component shall be placed in an individual stockpile, which shall be separated from the adjacent stockpiles, either by space or by a system of bulkheads. The intermingling of different materials in stockpiles shall be prevented at all times. 
5.3.2. Prevention of segregation. In the event that the method used for stockpiling coarse aggregate results in segregation of the aggregate, stockpiles shall be built up in layers not higher than four feet, with each layer completely in place before the next is started. Stockpiles shall not be formed by depositing material in one place or by forming cones. 
5.3.3. Blending of aggregates. Blending or proportioning from railroad cars will not be permitted. All aggregates shall be stockpiled prior to blending or placing in the cold-hoppers. All aggregates to be blended or proportioned shall be placed in separate bins at the hopper and proportioned by means of securely positioned calibrated gates or other approved devices. 
5.3.4. Mineral filler. If mineral filler is required in the mix it shall be fed or weighed-in separately from the other aggregates. 
5.4. Preparation of mixtures. 
5.4.1. Aggregates. The dried aggregates and mineral filler (if required), prepared in the manner previously described, and combined in batches to meet the job mix formula by weighing each separate bin size, shall be conveyed to the empty mixer. 
5.4.2. Bitumen. The hot asphalt cement, accurately measured, shall be introduced into the mixer simultaneously with, or after, the hot aggregates. Mixing shall continue until the mixture is thoroughly uniform, with all particles fully coated. 
5.4.3. Mixing time. The mixing time shall begin when the measuring devices for both the asphalt and the aggregates indicate that all the material is in the mixer, and shall continue until the material begins to leave the mixing unit. The mixing time will vary in relation to the nature of the aggregates and the capacity of the mixer, but shall in no case be less than 35 seconds. 
5.4.4. Continuous mixing. The dried aggregate and mineral filler (if required), prepared as specified and proportioned to meet the job mix formula by volumetric measurements, shall be introduced into the mixer in synchronization with the accurate feeding of the hot asphalt cement. The rate of flow of material to the pugmill shall be such that the maintained depth of the mix will not exceed the tips of the paddles when in the upright position. Mixing shall be sufficient to produce a thoroughly and uniformly coated mixture. 
5.4.5. Drum mixing. The aggregates and mineral filler (if required), prepared or specified and proportioned to meet the job mix formula, shall be introduced into the drum mixer with the accurate feeding of asphalt cement. The rate of flow of material to the drum shall be such that the manufacturer's mixing capacity shall not be exceeded. Mixing shall be sufficient to produce a thoroughly and uniformly coated mixture. 
5.4.6. Mixing temperature. The ingredients of the mix shall be heated and combined in such a manner as to produce a mixture which shall be at a temperature, when discharged from the pugmill or hot storage (surge) bin, within 25 degrees F of the design temperature, and within the temperature limits specified in section 5.2. 
5.4.7. Contractor's responsibility for mixture requirements. The responsibility for producing a homogeneous mixture, free from excess moisture and with no segregated materials, and meeting all requirements of the specifications for the mixture, including compliance with the design limits, shall lie entirely with the contractor. These requirements shall also apply to all mixes used from a hot storage or surge bin, both before and after storage. 
No mix shall be stored overnight. 
5.5. Transportation of the mixture. The mixture shall be transported in tight vehicles previously cleaned of all foreign material and each load shall be covered. The inside surface of the truck bodies shall be thinly coated with soapy water or an approved emulsion containing not over five percent oil, but no excess of either shall be used. Kerosene, gasoline or similar products shall not be used. After the truck bodies are coated and before any mixture is placed therein, they shall be raised so that all excess liquids will be drained out. 
5.6. Coating materials. 
5.6.1. Prime coat. The material used for prime coat shall be cut-back asphalt, asphalt grade RC-70 or RC-250, meeting the requirements of AASHTO M81-751, emulsified asphalt grades SS-1 or CSS-1, SS-1H or CSS-1H, diluted in equal proportion with water and meeting the requirements of AASHTO M140-70, or other types and grades of bituminous material which may be called for in approved plans. The contractor may select any of the specified bituminous materials for use, unless the approved plans indicate use of a specific material. Types and grades of bituminous material other than those specified above may be allowed if it can be shown that the alternate material will properly perform the function of prime coat material. 
5.6.2. Tack coat. The material used for tack coat shall be undiluted emulsified asphalt grades RS-1 or RS-2, unless some other specific material is called for by the approved plans. RS-1 and RS-2 shall be heated to a temperature range of between 140 degrees F and 180 degrees F. RS-1 may be modified by the addition of up to three percent naphtha during the winter months to improve handling of the material. 
5.6.3. Tack coat required. A tack coat, as specified in [section] 5.6.2, will be required on the following surfaces: 
a.  Between hot bituminous base courses and surface courses. 
b.  On primed bases which have become excessively dirty and cannot be cleaned. 
c.  In areas where the prime coat has cured to the extent that it has lost bonding effect. 
d.  On old pavements to be patched or leveled. 
5.6.4. Tack coat optional. A tack coat will be required on the following surfaces only when so directed by the engineer of record: 
a.  Freshly primed bases. 
b.  Surface treatment. 
c.  Other surfaces shown on the approved plans. 
5.7. Preparation of application surfaces. 
5.7.1. Cleaning. Prior to the laying of the mixture, the surface of the base of pavement to be covered shall be cleaned of all loose and deleterious material by the use of power brooms, supplemented by hand brooming as necessary. 
5.7.2. Patching and leveling courses. Where a surface course is constructed on an existing pavement or old base which is irregular, and wherever so indicated in the approved plans, the existing surface shall be brought to proper grade and cross section by the application of patching or leveling courses. 
5.7.3. Application over surface treatment. Where a surface course is to be placed over a newly constructed surface treatment, all loose material shall be swept from the paving area and disposed of by the contractor. 
5.7.4. Coating surfaces of contacting structures. All structures which will be in actual contact with the asphalt mixture, with the exception of the vertical faces of existing pavements and curbs or curb and gutter, shall be provided with a uniform coating of asphalt cement to provide a closely bonded, watertight joint. 
5.8. Placing mixture. 
5.8.1. Requirements applicable to all types. 
a.  Alignment of edges. All asphaltic concrete mixtures (including leveling courses), other than adjacent to curb and gutter or other true edges, shall be laid by the string line method, to assure obtaining an accurate, uniform alignment of the pavement edge. 
b.  Temperature of spreading. The temperature of the mixture at the time of spreading shall be within 25 degrees F of the temperature set by the engineer of record, which temperature shall be between 270 degrees F and 350 degrees F, unless otherwise directed. 
c.  Rain and surface conditions. Any mixture caught in transit by sudden rain may be laid only at the contractor's risk. Should such mixture prove unsatisfactory, it shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory mixture at the contractor's expense. In no case shall the mixture be laid while rain is falling or when there is water on the surface to be covered. 
d.  Number of crews required. For each paving machine being operated, the contractor will be required to use a separate crew, each crew operating as a full unit. 
e.  Checking depth of layer. The depth of each layer shall be checked at frequent intervals, not to exceed 25 feet. Any deviation from the required thickness, in excess of the allowable tolerance, shall be immediately corrected. 
f.  Hand spreading. In limited areas where the use of the spreader is impossible or impracticable, the mixture may be spread and finished by hand. 
g.  Straight-edging and back-patching. Straight-edging and back-patching shall be done after initial compaction has been obtained and while the material is still hot. 
5.8.2. Requirements applicable only to surface courses. 
a.  Spreading and finishing. Upon arrival, the mixture shall be dumped into the approved mechanical spreader and immediately spread and struck-off to the full width required, and to such loose depth for each course that, when the work is completed, the required weight of mixture per square yard, or the specified thickness, will be obtained. An excess amount of mixture shall be carried ahead of the screed at all times. Hand raking shall be done behind the machine as required. 
b.  Thickness of layers. Where a surface course is to be constructed to a thickness greater than two inches, it shall be constructed in approximately equal layers and no layer shall be more than two inches in thickness when compacted. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted and shall conform to the requirements of these specifications before an additional layer is placed. 
c.  Laying width. If necessary due to traffic requirements, the mixture shall be laid in strips in such manner as to provide for the passage of traffic. Where the road is closed to traffic, the mixture may be laid to the full width, by machines traveling in echelon. 
d.  Correcting defects. Before any rolling is started the surface shall be checked, any irregularities adjusted, and all drippings, fat sandy accumulations from the screed, and fat spots from any source shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory material. No skin patching shall be done. When a depression is to be corrected while the mixture is hot, the surface shall be well scarified before the addition of fresh mixture. 
5.8.3. Requirements applicable only to leveling courses. 
a.  Patching depressions. Before any leveling course is spread, all depressions in the existing surface more than one inch deep shall be filled by spot patching with leveling course mixture and then thoroughly compacted. 
b.  Work adjacent to bridge ends. On resurfacing projects where the roadway joins an existing bridge and where necessary to insure that a bump will not be created by the overlay, before any surfacing is placed adjacent to the bridge, a portion of the existing pavement shall be bladed off, in order that a smooth transition between the new surfacing and the bridge end may be effected. 
c.  Spreading leveling courses. The leveling shall be placed by the use of a paving machine, in good condition and appropriate for the project to be undertaken. Other types of leveling devices may be used, subject to prior approval by the engineer of record, with the concurrence of the department of public works. 
d.  Rate of application. When the total amount of leveling course material to be applied exceeds 50 pounds per square yard, it shall be applied in separate courses, with the average spread not to exceed 50 pounds per square yard. When type S-III asphaltic concrete is used for leveling, the average spread for each leveling course shall not be less than 50 pounds per square [yard], nor more than 75 pounds per square yard. Unless otherwise indicated the quantity shown in the plans for leveling represents an average for the entire job. The rate of application of leveling may be increased or decreased, as necessary, at locations designated by the engineer of record. Where widening construction is specified in connection with leveling, the engineer of record may require that approximately 50 percent of the leveling be placed prior to the widening operation. 
e.  Placing leveling over existing concrete pavement. For leveling course to be applied over broken existing concrete pavement (with or without old asphaltic surface), the first course of the leveling shall be placed as soon after the cracking and reseating of the concrete as is practicable, but not later than two days after the cracking operations on any section. The remainder of the surfacing shall follow in the normal sequence of operations. 
f.  Removal of excess joint material. Where leveling is placed over concrete pavement or concrete deck-slab bridges, all excess joint filler at the cracks and joints shall be removed flush with the existing concrete prior to placing the leveling course. 
5.9. Compacting mixture. 
5.9.1. Provisions applicable to all types. 
a.  Equipment and sequence. For each paving or leveling train in operation, the contractor shall furnish a separate set of rollers, with their operators. The rolling shall be done in the following sequence, with the equipment as shown, unless otherwise permitted by the engineer of record, with the concurrence of the department of public works. 
(1)  Seal rolling, using tandem steel rollers weighing five to 12 tons, and following as close behind the spreaders as is possible without pick-up, undue displacement or blistering of the material. 
(2)  Rolling with self propelled pneumatic-tired rollers, following as close behind the seal rolling as the mix will permit. The roller shall cover every portion of the surface with at least five passes. 
(3)  Final rolling with the five to 12 ton tandem steel rollers, to be done after the seal rolling and pneumatic-tired rolling have been completed, but before the pavement temperature has dropped below 175 degrees F. 
b.  Compaction at crossovers, intersection, etc. When a separate paving machine is being used to pave the crossovers, the compaction of the crossovers may be done by one five- to ten-ton tandem steel roller. If crossovers, intersections and acceleration and deceleration lanes are placed with the main run of paving, a traffic roller shall also be used in the compaction of these areas. 
5.9.2. Rolling procedures. The initial rolling shall be longitudinal. When the lane being placed is adjacent to a previously placed lane, the center joint shall be pinched or rolled, prior to the rolling of the rest of the lane. After the rolling or pinching of the center joint, the rolling shall continue across the mat by overlapping each previous roller path by at least one-half the width of the roller wheel. The motion of the roller shall be slow enough to avoid displacement of the mixture, and any displacement shall be corrected at once by the use of rakes, and the addition of fresh mixture if required. Final rolling shall be continued until all roller marks are eliminated. 
a.  Speed of rolling. Rolling with the self-propelled, pneumatic-tired rollers shall proceed at a speed of six- to ten-miles per hour, and the area covered by each roller shall not be more than 4,000 square yards per hour, except that for type S asphaltic concrete, this maximum rate of coverage shall be 3,000 square yards per hour. 
b.  Number of pneumatic tired rollers required. A sufficient number of self-propelled pneumatic-tired rollers shall be used to assure that the rolling of the surface for the required number of passes will not delay any other phase of the laying operation nor result in excessive cooling of the mixture before the rolling is complete. In the event that the rolling falls behind, the laying operation shall be discontinued until the rolling operations are sufficiently caught up. 
c.  Compaction of areas inaccessible to rollers. Areas which are inaccessible to a roller (such as areas adjacent to curbs, headers, gutters, bridges, manholes, etc.,) shall be compacted by the use of hand tamps or other satisfactory means. 
d.  Rolling patching and leveling courses. Self-propelled pneumatic-tired rollers shall be used for the rolling of all patching and leveling courses. 
e.  Correcting defects. The rollers shall not be allowed to deposit gasoline, oil or grease onto the pavement, and any areas damaged by such deposits shall be removed and replaced as directed by the engineer of record. While rolling is in progress, the surface shall be tested continuously and all discrepancies corrected to comply with the surface requirements. All drippings, fat or lean areas and defective construction of any description shall be removed and replaced. Depressions which develop before the completion of the rolling, shall be remedied by loosening the mixture and adding new mixture to bring the depressions to a true surface. Should any depression remain after the final compaction has been obtained, the full depth of the mixture shall be removed and replaced with sufficient new mixture to form a true and even surface. All high spots, high joints and honeycomb shall be corrected as directed by the engineer of record. Any mixture remaining unbonded after rolling shall be removed and replaced. Any mixture which becomes loose or broken, mixed or coated with dirt or in any way defective, prior to laying the wearing course, shall be removed and replaced with fresh mixture, which shall be immediately compacted to conform with the surrounding area. Areas of defective surface may be repaired by the use of indirect heat. No method of repair involving open-flame heaters shall be used. 
f.  Provisions applicable to shoulder pavement only. Shoulder pavements wider than three feet shall be compacted by the use of equipment of the type required for other asphaltic concrete pavements. Compaction of asphaltic concrete three feet or less in width, shall be done by the use of tandem steel rollers not exceeding 12 tons in weight. Other compaction in such restricted widths shall be by the use of any type of rubber-tired equipment the contractor may elect to use, approved by the engineer of record, with the concurrence of the department of public works. 
5.9.3. Density required for asphaltic concrete pavement. After final compaction, the density shall be at least 96 percent of the laboratory compacted density of the paving mixture for that days' production. 
5.10. Joints. 
5.10.1. Transverse joints. Placing of the mixture shall be as continuous as possible and the roller shall not pass over the unprotected end of the freshly laid mixture except when the laying operation is to be discontinued long enough to permit the mixture to become chilled. When the laying operation is thus interrupted, a transverse joint shall be constructed by cutting back on the previous run to expose the full depth of the mat. 
5.10.2. Longitudinal joints. Where only a portion of the width of pavement is to be laid and opened to traffic, longitudinal joints shall be formed by rolling the exposed edge of the strip first laid. When the adjacent strip is constructed, the engineer of record may require the edge of the mixture in place to be trimmed back to expose an unsealed or granular vertical surface. Where the strip first laid is closed to traffic, the edge shall not be sealed but shall be left vertical and the adjacent strip placed against it without trimming. 
5.10.3. General. When fresh mixture is laid against the exposed edges of joints (trimmed or formed as provided above), it shall be placed in close contact with the exposed edge so that an even, well-compacted joint will be produced after rolling. 
5.11. Surface requirements. 
5.11.1. Checking with rolling straightedge. The final surface course of all pavements will be required to be checked by the rolling straightedge, in accordance with the following provisions. As soon as the rolling has been completed and the surface has hardened sufficiently to be walked on, the entire surface shall be checked with a rolling straightedge, set to indicate any surface irregularities in excess of 3/16 inch. The rolling straightedge shall have an effective length of 15 feet and its design shall meet the approval of the engineer of record. The rolling straightedge and labor for its operation shall be supplied by the contractor. The straightedge shall be applied in lines parallel to the centerline, at least twice for each pass of the spreader. Straight-edging shall be extended across all joints. Any irregularities in excess of 3/16 inch shall be corrected by removing and replacing the defective sections or by overlaying with surface material, as directed by the engineer of record. Straight-edging of paved shoulders will not be required unless so directed by the engineer of record. 
5.11.2. Manual straightedge. A 15-foot manual straightedge shall be furnished by the contractor and shall be available at all times on the work. The contractor shall designate an employee whose duty it is to handle the straightedge in checking the compacted surfaces under the direction of the engineer of record, or if requested by a representative of the department of public works. 
5.11.3. Permissible variations from true surface. The finished surface shall not vary more than 3/16 inch from the straightedge applied parallel to the centerline of the pavement. Any surface irregularities exceeding such limits shall be corrected in accordance with the requirements. 
5.11.4. Texture of finished surface. The finished surface shall be of uniform texture and compaction. The surface shall have no pulled, torn or loosened portions, and shall be free of sand streaks, sand spots or ripples. These requirements shall also apply to any areas where it is necessary to apply hand work. 
5.11.5. [Corrections to finished surface; contractor's expense.] Any areas in which the surface does not meet the above requirements for texture, sand streaks, ripples, pulled or loosened portions, or for uniformity of compaction; or does not meet the straight-edging requirements, shall be corrected at the contractor's expense. Such corrections may be made either by replacing the surface course (to full depth) or by overlaying with the type of asphaltic concrete mixture being placed. Within the longitudinal limits where such defective areas occur, such corrections shall be made for the full width of the roadway and for longitudinal distances in both directions beyond such defective areas in accordance with the following: 
(a)  If the correction is made by replacing of the full thickness, it shall extend to at least 50 feet each side of the defective area. 
(b)  If the contractor elects to effect the correction by overlaying, the overlay shall consist of at least 100 pounds of mixture per square yard, at the defective section and shall taper uniformly down from the full thickness of such weight, to zero thickness, feathered, at the end of a minimum length of 50 feet each side of the defective area. 
(c)  The transverse thickness at any section shall be such as to provide the design cross section. 
5.12. Protection of finished surface. Sections of newly compacted asphaltic concrete which are to be covered by additional courses shall be kept clean until the successive course is laid. 
Upon completion of the finished pavement, no dumping of any material directly on the pavement will be permitted. When shoulders are constructed after completion of the final surface, blade graders operating adjacent to the pavement during shoulder construction shall have a two-inch by eight-inch (or larger) board (or other attachment providing essentially the same results) attached to their blades in such manner that it extends below the blade edge, in order to protect the pavement surface from damage by the grader blade. Vehicular traffic shall not be permitted on any pavement which has not set sufficiently to prevent rutting or other distortion. 
5.13. Other requirements. All requirements outlined above may be supplemented by, substituted for or modified by the Florida Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction," latest edition, at the discretion of the engineer of record, with the concurrence of the city administrator, acting through the department of public works. 
CHAPTER 6 - ROADS AND STREETS; TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 

1. - Streets and roadways. 
1.1. Design criteria. 
1.1.1. Design standards. As a minimum, roads and/or streets and related facilities shall be designed in accordance with the latest editions of the "Manual of Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets & Highways" (Green Book), Flexible Pavement Design Manual", "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" and the Utility Accommodation Guide, as published by the State of Florida Department of Transportation, except as modified herein. 
1.2. Construction criteria. Construction materials and methods shall meet the requirements of the latest edition of the Florida Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" and supplements, except as modified herein, and the provisions of chapter 2 of this document. 
1.2.1. Temporary facilities. Temporary facilities, unrelated to any ongoing construction in the right-of-way, and intended to provide an essential service for a period of time not to exceed one year, may be constructed in the right-of-way, contingent upon department of public works approval of project plans and specifications, and issuance of a department of public works construction permit. There will be no relaxation of safety requirements, but lighter duty construction will be allowed, where public interests will not suffer. 
1.2.2. [Temporary facilities implementation approval.] In cases where temporary facilities must be constructed to provide or maintain an essential feature around portions of a public right-of-way for public safety or convenience during construction, such temporary facility must be clearly drawn in sufficient detail on standard size drafting sheets, and submitted to the department of public works for review and approval prior to implementation. 
1.3. Typical sections. Sketches of proposed typical sections, indicating design speed, shall be submitted to the department of public works for approval prior to beginning the preparation of plans, and shall show or note all existing conditions or facilities that might influence a proper engineering evaluation of the proposed project. 
1.4. Safety criteria. Minimum safety criteria for design of roads and streets in the City of Okeechobee shall be in accordance with FDOT requirements. 
1.5. Roadways adjacent and parallel to waterways. The following policy is to be implemented in the design of all roadway construction involving lakes and canals when it is necessary for such waterways to exist adjacent and parallel to the roadway. 
For purposes of the policy, a canal is considered to be an open ditch with the side slope adjacent to the roadway 4:1 or steeper and/or with a seasonal water depth in excess of three feet for extended periods of time (24 hours or more). When the roadway slope and the canal side slope adjacent to the roadway is 6:1 or flatter, the minimum distance to the canal may be measured from the edge of the through travel lane to the "extended period of time" water surface. The berm between the roadway front slope and canal slope is not required for this condition. 
1.5.1. Minimum distance to canal. The distance from the outside edge of the through travel lane to the top of the lake/canal side slope nearest the road, will be no less than 60 feet for highways with design speeds of 50 miles per hour (mph) or greater. For highways with design speeds less than 50 mph, this minimum distance may be reduced to 50 feet for rural highways or 40 feet for urban (curb and gutter) highways. When a new lake/canal or roadway alignment is required, at less than the ultimate cross section, distances greater than these above should be provided, if possible, to accommodate possible future improvements to roadway (widening, etc.). 
1.5.2. Roadways on fill sections. A flat berm (maximum 10:1 slope) of width no less than 20 feet will be provided between the top of the roadway front slope and the top of the lake/canal side slope nearest the roadway. This minimum berm width applies to all types of highways, both rural and urban (curb and gutter) construction, regardless of the distance from roadway front slope to the top of the lake/canal side slope.

1.5.4. Installation of protection. Installation of guardrail, or other approved protective devices, are recommended throughout all areas where it is impracticable (by the determination of the city administrator) to meet the above minimum criteria. For canals located on the outside of curves sharper than two degrees, greater offset widths or construction of guardrail should be considered. 
When guardrail is required for canal protection, it will normally be placed at or near the edge of the clear recovery area. The distance from the outside edge of the shoulder to the face of guardrail should, in all cases, be greater than 12 feet when guardrail is not constructed at the edge of the shoulder. The roadway front slope back of guardrail may be steepened to 2:1. 
1.6. Flexible pavement design. Flexible pavement design shall be in accordance with the criteria established in the "FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual", latest edition. Road design by this method requires calculation of a structural number, which is obtained by multiplying the FDOT (AASHTO) structural coefficient by the thickness of each layer of material, then adding the resultants in accordance with the FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual. (SN = a 1 D 1 + a 2 D 2 +. . . a n D n ). Minimum structural number (SN), as calculated from the referenced design manual, shall be as follows: 
Structural Number Residential   Arterial 3.54   Collector 2.98   Local 2.23 Industrial 2.98 Commercial 2.98  
The engineer of record shall provide the flexible pavement design calculations to the department of public works with all road plans, plus a copy of all limerock bearing ratio (LBR) test reports. 
Table 1, taken from the FDOT design manual provides layer coefficients for use in the calculations, along with the referenced FDOT standard specifications section for the various layers. 
Any deviations or deficiencies from the design which may occur in the construction of the road shall be corrected by construction or reconstruction to obtain the minimum structural number (i.e., additional asphaltic concrete surface course, etc.), only as approved by the city administrator. The engineer of record shall submit measurements of the actually constructed road section, along with calculations of the structural number of the proposed remedial work.

CHAPTER 7 - SUBDIVISION PLANNING 

1. - Objectives. 
The objectives of the City of Okeechobee in subdivision planning are to promote health, safety and welfare in enhancing the quality of life for its residents. This dictates a safe and efficient access and traffic circulation system. The following principles are to be considered in accomplishing these objectives: 
1.1. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access shall be provided for all parcels. Street widths, sidewalk placement, patterns of streets and number of intersections shall take into consideration both safety and efficiency of access to abutting parcels. Every parcel shall abut an approved private street, an approved access easement, or a street dedicated to, and accepted by the city for maintenance. 
1.2. Minimization of traffic movements through local streets. Through traffic shall be discouraged through the use of discontinuities in local street patterns by offsetting local street intersections and by channeling or controlling street medians along peripheral major or collector streets. This will reduce the amount and speed of traffic, thereby making local streets more safe and amenable to residents. 
1.3. Logic and consistency in street numbering and naming. A consistent and logical pattern shall be developed to simplify local street naming and numbering, to assist visitors in locating addresses and facilitate access by emergency vehicles, delivery vehicles, etc. 
1.4. Efficient traffic circulation and development patterns. Driveways, intersection placement and access shall be controlled so that no parcels require direct access to major or collector streets. Provisions shall be provided for continuing existing principal streets from adjoining areas through new subdivisions. Where streets are extended to subdivision boundaries and abut either undeveloped adjoining land, or connect to collector or arterial roads, the location of the subdivision street shall be coordinated with the city administrator to facilitate future street development in adjoining areas, for overall efficiency of traffic flow and for safety considerations of future intersections. 
1.5. Design for purpose intended. Local streets shall not be overdesigned or overbuilt, i.e., extra width, higher speed, etc., to a degree which will detract from the residential character and which will encourage higher use and higher traffic speed. The use of curvilinear alignment and discontinuities is encouraged to minimize speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour and discourage through traffic. 
1.6. Minimum of intersections. Intersections shall be kept to the minimum number practicable, particularly between local streets and collector or arterial roads, to reduce accident potential. Consistent with other requirements, "T" intersections are preferable to four-way, or cross-type intersections. Streets shall be arranged to intersect as closely as possible to right angles. In no case shall streets intersect at an angle of less than 75 degrees. 
2. - Planning and design criteria. 
2.1. Local streets. 
2.1.1. Maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 1,200 feet, unless otherwise approved by the city administrator. Minimum paved radius shall be 36 feet. 
2.1.2. Local streets shall intersect with other local streets to the maximum extent practicable, and in no case with more than one collector or arterial road. 
2.1.3. Loop roads, culs-de-sac and curvilinear streets shall be considered in the planning and design. 
2.2. Collector streets. 
2.2.1. No direct access shall be provided to a collector street from a residential lot. 
2.2.2. Collector/arterial streets shall connect to only one collector or arterial road. 
2.2.3. Residential dwellings shall face away from collector/arterial streets (i.e., collector/arterial street to side or rear lot line). 
2.3. Commercial sites. Commercial sites shall conform to these standards in regard to roadway improvements, rights-of-way, sidewalks, driveways and all other requirements outlined for residential subdivisions, as appropriate. 
CHAPTER 8 - INSTALLATIONS FOR INTER-EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE AND CABLE TV OR OTHER SIGNAL INSTALLATIONS 

1. - Permits. 
1.1. Aerial installations. The construction or maintenance of all aerial installation of telephone, cable TV, or other signal lines in city rights-of-way shall require permits only if the work involves installation, removal, or relocation of supporting poles or interruption of the normal flow of traffic on the roadway. 
1.2. Underground installations. The construction, maintenance, repair or removal of any underground installations of telephone, cable TV, or other signal carrying lines in the public rights-of-way shall not commence prior to issuance of a permit from the department of public utilities, by authority of the city administrator, except as provided in chapter 2, sections 1.2.1. and 1.3. 
2. - Permit requirements. 
2.1.

The artist will be interviewed to explain their proposal and receive input from the committee. If accepted, the artist will prepare a final full color rendering suitable for framing, which will become the property of Okeechobee Main Street. This final rendering will be approved by the Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee, which in turn will be approved by Okeechobee Main Street, and the City of Okeechobee. 
2.  A Call to Entry which is circulated to known artists and advertised in relevant journals or newsletters. The call to entry contains a description of the mural/visual art (location, size, theme, background information, etc.) and request that sketches be submitted within a particular time frame (usually one month). The Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee juries the submissions and approves a short list of artists who will be interviewed. The artists are interviewed to explain their qualifications and their proposal and receive input from the Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee. The Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee will then select an artist, and the artist will prepare a final full color rendering and procedures will follow as in stated above (#1). 
An Artists Agreement shall be executed between the Artist and Okeechobee Main Street. 
Sec. 11. - Building owner guidelines.

    Approval of all murals and visual art by the Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee is granted for a specific design and one-time production of murals and/or visual art presented. Approval does not constitute either an indication or promise of any other commission of the same artist, location, or material. All approvals will be granted and commissioned on an individual project basis, and no changes are to made to the original approved image presented to the Main Street Mural and Visual Arts Committee. Production time will be adhered to as outlined in the Artists Agreement form.
