PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pittsburg, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through January 25, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the city staff for its cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Ord. No. G-1161, § 2, 2-28-2012) 
Sec. 14-132. - Airport zones recommended. 
    Prior to establishing the zones that are set forth in this division there shall be submitted to the City Commission reports and recommendations by the Atkinson Municipal Airport Airspace Protection Commission, which commission shall: 
(1)  Recommend the boundaries of the various zones that are set forth. 
(2)  Recommend the height and hazard regulations to be adopted therefor. 
(3)  Make a preliminary report which considers: 
a.  The character of the flying operations currently conducted and expected to be conducted at the airport, 
b.  The nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area, 
c.  The character of the neighborhood in and surrounding the airport hazard area, and 
d.  The uses to which the property to be regulated is put and adaptable. 
(4)  Hold a public hearing on the recommended regulations and submit a final report and recommendations to the City Commission. 
    The airport height and hazard regulations shall apply to the airport hazard areas as recommended by the Airspace Protection Commission and adopted by the City Commission. The airport hazard areas, wherein the height and hazard regulations apply, include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, conical surfaces and any other territory surrounding the Atkinson Municipal Airport divided into zones, as depicted on the Atkinson Municipal Airport Airspace Protection Area Map, which is a regulatory graphic made a part hereof and attached to this division, created from the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) "Kansas Airspace Awareness Tool" at http:/www.ksdot.org/airspacetool . The map is provided an attachment to this division for illustrative purposes, only, in order to generally show where these regulations apply; and it is not to be relied upon as a regulatory tool. For administrative purposes, when applying these regulations on a case-by-case basis, the standard FAA procedures for determining compliance of proposed structures with height and hazard standards should be relied upon as the starting point for interpreting the applicability of these regulations. 
    An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  FAR part 77 Surfaces, subpart C Civil Airport Imaginary Surfaces Zones. The horizontal surface, conical surface, primary surface, approach surface, and transitional surface as designated by the FAA: 
a.  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (PTS runways 16-34 and 04-22, existing and ultimate) 
b.  Transitional zone. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
c.  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
d.  Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(2)  Runway approach minimum zones The approach zones to the runways, the minimum ceiling or visibility under which an aircraft may be landed with the use of a published approach procedure; and the planned nonprecision or precision instrument approach minimums so indicated on the approved airport layout plan (ALP) or the airport airspace protection area map, which depicts the terminal instrument procedures surfaces (TERPS) and the vertically guided approach surfaces (VGAS) for the airport as referenced on the KDOT "Kansas Airspace Awareness Tool" at http:/www.ksdot.org/airspacetool . 
(3)  Terminal instrument procedures surfaces (TERPS) zones, which can extend ten nautical miles from a runway, constructed from the electronic signals transmitted by ground- and space-based air navigation electronic equipment. These are the instrument procedures that aircraft pilots use to fly between airports and land on runways. 
(4)  Vertically guided approach surfaces (VGAS) zones, which provide lower minima for approach procedures that do not rely on ground based navigational systems, including instrument landing system (ILS), to improve airport capacity when ground-based systems are out of service-for better access to runways with terrain or airspace constraints using curved RNAV legs and narrower protected surfaces; and for improved safety by eliminating circling maneuvers and providing laterally and vertically guided approaches not available through conventional ground-based navigational aid (NAVAID) procedures or through existing area navigation (RNAV) procedures. 
(Ord. No. G-1161, § 3, 2-28-2012) 
Sec. 14-133. - Airport zones and surfaces height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this division, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this division to a height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  FAR part 77 Surfaces, sub-part C Civil Airport Imaginary Surfaces Zones. The horizontal surface, conical surface, primary surface, approach surface, and transitional surface as designated by the FAA: 
a.  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/4 mile nonprecision instrument approach zone slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward (34:1) beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended centerlines of each runway (PTS runways 16-34 and 04-22). 
b.  Transitional zones slope seven feet outward for each foot upward (7:1) beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the elevations each runway. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface of each runway, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
c.  Horizontal zone -Established at 150 feet above the airport elevations (PTS runways 16-34 and 04-22). 
d.  Conical zone slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward (20:1) beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevations and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevations. 
(2)  Runway approach minimum zones. The slopes established by the minimum ceiling or visibility under which an aircraft may be landed with the use of a published approach procedure; and by the planned nonprecision or precision instrument approach minimums so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other planning document. 
(3)  Terminal instrument procedures surfaces (TERPS) zones. The slopes established by the electronic signals transmitted by ground- and space-based air navigation electronic equipment, which instrument procedures aircraft pilots use to fly between airports and land on runways, and as referenced on the KDOT "Kansas Airspace Awareness Tool" http:/www.ksdot.org/airspacetool .

Sec. 14-135. - Use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this division in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Furthermore, no use may be made of the land or water within any zone established by this division that would result in permanently raising the published or planned approach minimums. 
(Ord. No. G-1161, § 6, 2-28-2012) 
Sec. 14-136. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this division shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this division [February 28, 2012], or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this division [February 28, 2012], and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Airspace Administrator, in consultation with the Airport Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Atkinson Municipal Airport and hence, the City Commission of Pittsburg, Kansas. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Airport Airspace Administrator, in consultation with the Airport Manager, determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 51 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the height and hazard regulations; except that, private residences that are not closer than 4,200 feet from the end of a runway in an approach or transitional zone shall be exempt from nonconforming use restrictions. 
(Ord. No. G-1161, § 7, 2-28-2012) 
Sec. 14-137. - Permits. 
(a)  Permits required when. Permit applications shall be submitted for proposed structures in any of the zones or surfaces except as specifically provided in subsection (b), hereunder. Each permit application shall be submitted on forms required by the City to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to these regulations. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. The fee for the airspace permit is $25.00. 
(b)  No permit required when. No permit shall be required for structures shorter than 75 feet or trees less than 25 feet; provided that, in an approach or transitional zone the proposed structure or tree is more than 4,200 feet from the end of a runway; provided further that, this permit exception shall not be construed as permitting any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this division. 
(c)  Permit conditioned on FAA form 7460-1, "Notice of Construction". Any proposed construction, alteration or repair requiring a permit must have filed an FAA form 7460-1 (FAA 77.13 Construction or Alteration Requiring Notice) with the appropriate FAA regional office. No construction, alteration or repair work may commence until the determination is received from the FAA and said determination is reviewed by the Airport Airspace Administrator. 
(d)  Existing uses. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this division shall be granted, or for a use that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming structure to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for a permit is made; unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (f). 
(e)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. No permit shall be granted that would allow a nonconforming structure to be reconstructed in any way that exceeds the applicable height limit or otherwise deviates from the height and hazard regulations once it has been determined that the nonconforming structure has been abandoned or more than 51 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed; except that, private residences that are not closer than 4,200 feet from the end of a runway in an approach or transitional zone shall be exempt from nonconforming use restrictions. 
(f)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use of property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this division, may apply to the Airport Board of Appeals for a variance from such regulations; provided, that any variance may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the City of Pittsburg, as the political subdivision owning, controlling and operating the airport, may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of these regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the FAA as to the effect of the proposal on the published or planned approach minimums, operation of air navigation facilities, and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in necessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this division. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this division may be considered by the Airport Board of Appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport Airspace Administrator for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Airspace Administrator does not respond to the application within 21 days after receipt, the Airport Board of Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(g)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may be so conditioned, if such action is deemed advisable, to effectuate the purpose of this division and be reasonable in the circumstances, as to require the owner of the structure in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Pittsburg City Commission, upon directives from KDOT or the FAA, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City Commission of Pittsburg, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(Ord. No. G-1161, § 8, 2-28-2012) 
Sec. 14-138. - Administration and enforcement.

4.  Procedure for dilapidation and abandoned structures.

Such complaint shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the Public Officer or his designated agent at a place therein fixed, not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the serving of such complaint. The owner, mortgagee and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Public Officer. 
(b)  If, after such notice and hearing, the Public Officer determines that the structure under consideration is unfit for human use or habitation, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order which: 
1.  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, which shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of such structure, the owner of such property shall, within the time specified in the order, repair, alter or improve such structure to render it safe and fit for human use or habitation, or, the owner of such property shall, within the time specified in the order, vacate, close, board/secure the structure for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months, or until conformance with this Section is made, whichever period is shorter; or,

If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure, that is to say under fifty (50) percent of the fair market value which is hereby fixed as a reasonable cost by the Governing Body of such City, the owner shall, within the time specified in such order, remove or demolish such structure. 
(c)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve, or, to vacate, close, board/secure the structure within thirty (30) days from the date of such order, the Public Officer may cause such structure to be vacated, closed, boarded and secured for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.

1.  The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements or vacating, closing, boarding/securing, re-boarding/re-securing, or removal of demolition by the Public Officer shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred and such lien, including as part thereof allowance of his costs and the necessary attorney's fees, may be foreclosed in judicial proceedings, in the manner provided or authorized by law for loans secured by liens on real property or shall be assessed as a special assessment against the lot or parcel of land on which the structure was located and the City Clerk shall, at the time of certifying other City taxes, certify the unpaid portion of such costs, and the County Clerk shall extend the same on the tax rolls of the County against such lot or parcel of land. If the structure is removed or demolished by the Public Officer, he shall sell the materials of such structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and, if there be any balance remaining, it shall be paid to the parties entitled thereto as determined by proper judicial proceedings instituted by the Public Officer after deducting the costs of such judicial proceedings including his necessary attorney's fees incurred therein, as determined by the court.

Sec. 78-39. - Amendment to Section 13 of the Standard Traffic Ordinance, traffic-control signal legend. 
    Sec. 13. Traffic-Control Signal Legend. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(a)  Green Indication. 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn; but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection cautiously only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless otherwise provided by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in Section 14, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(b)  Steady Yellow Indication. 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is hereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. Vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the intersection unless so close to the intersection that a stop cannot be made in safety. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section 14, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(c)  Steady Red Indication. 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. Any turn provided for in said paragraph (2) and (3) shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Section 49 of this ordinance. 
(2)  Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic upon a roadway restricted to one-way traffic facing a steady red signal at the intersection of such roadway with another roadway restricted to one-way traffic which is proceeding to the left of such vehicular traffic, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a left turn after stopping as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other-traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(4)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section 14, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(d)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

(Ord. No. G-930, § 4, 11-11-2003) 
Sec. 82-546. - Rate schedule. 
    There is hereby established the following uniform schedule of rates for the services and use of facilities of the stormwater management system by the owner, tenant or occupant of the premises using the services and facilities of said system. 
(a)  The City Commission, upon recommendation of the City Manager, shall, by resolution, establish reasonable rates for stormwater management systems for each residential dwelling unit; each residential dwelling unit shall be billed a flat fee established by the City Commission. An equivalent residential unit is hereby defined as the statistical average horizontal impervious area of residential units in the City. 
(b)  Parcels which are undeveloped shall be assessed a stormwater user fee. The bill shall be determined by dividing the total land area of the property, in square feet, by the area of an equivalent residential unit times a correction factor. The correction factor may be based on the relative volume of runoff from an undeveloped property and that of a typical single-family residence, under typical hydrologic conditions. 
(c)  For all nonresidential properties, that is, enterprise, business establishment, building or other occupancy not covered by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section, the rate shall be computed based on the total impervious area of the property divided by the average impervious area of an equivalent residential unit times the rate established for an equivalent residential unit. The billing amount shall be updated by the Public Utilities Department based on any additions to the impervious areas as approved through the building permit process.

Section 18. - Amendment or termination of the plan. 
a.  While the employer expects to continue the plan and payment of contributions hereunder indefinitely, the right to amend or terminate the plan is necessarily reserved to the employer together with the right to discontinue, suspend or change the rate and amount of its contributions at any time. However, no such action shall cause any part of the corpus or income of the plan to be used for, or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the members, nor shall any such action adversely affect the retirement income already provided under the contract. 
b.  In the event of discontinuance of the plan, the contributions made by the employer will remain for the exclusive benefit of members under the plan.

    The provisions of the group annuity contract shall govern with respect to the rights and obligations of the insurance carrier, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the plan. 
    This plan is contingent upon and subject to obtaining such approval of the commissioner of internal revenue as may be necessary to establish qualification of the plan. 
Section 20. - Management and policy direction.

20-103 Establishment of Airport Zones:
In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to Atkinson Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown on the Atkinson Airport Zoning Map consisting of 1 page, prepared for the City of Pittsburg Planning and Engineering Department, dated February 2, 1979, which is hereby made a part of this Ordinance. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
1. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizon al distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
2. Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (This zone applies to Runway 4-22.)
3. Runway Larger than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater than 3/4 Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. (This zone applies to Runway 16-34.)
4. Transitional Zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
5. Horizontal Zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual, and 10,000 feet for all others, from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
6. Conical Zone: The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 88
20-104 Airport Zone Height Limitations:
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this Article to a height in excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
1. Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone: Slopes 20 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the end of, and at the same elevation as, the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
2. Utility Runway Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: Slopes 20 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the end of, and at the same elevation as, the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
3. Runway Larger than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater than 3/4 Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone: Slopes 34 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the end of, and at the same elevation as, the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
4. Transitional Zones: Slopes 7 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the sides of, and at the same elevation as, the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the sides of, and the same elevation as, the approach surface and extending to where they intersect the conical surface or horizontal surface.
5. Horizontal Zone: Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation.
6. Conical Zone: Slopes 20 feet outward for each 1 foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation, and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
7. Excepted Height Limitations: Except in the Approach Zones, nothing in this Article shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of any tree, to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
20-105 Use Restrictions:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this Article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. No sanitary landfill may be established, operated, maintained within 2 miles of the airport boundary
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 89
20-106 Nonconforming Uses:
1. Regulations not Retroactive: The regulations prescribed in this Article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations at the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuation of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and is diligently pursued.
2. Marking and Lighting: Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Article, the owner or any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to indicate the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of Pittsburg.
20-107 Permits:
1. Future Uses: Except as specifically provided in A., B., and C. hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit there for shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this Article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Section 20-107 (4.)
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Article, except as set forth in Section 20-104 (7.).
a. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground; except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographical features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
b. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet height above the ground; except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zone.
c. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground; except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 90
2. Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
3. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the Zoning Ordinance.
4. Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in the Article, may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance from such regulations. Each application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this Article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this Article may be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Airport Manager and/or Airport Advisory Committee for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager and/or Airport Advisory Committee do not respond to the application within 30 days after receipt, the Board of Zoning Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
5. Obstruction Marking and Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Article and be reasonable in circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Zoning Appeals and approved by the Governing Body, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City of Pittsburg, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
20-108 Enforcement:
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed in this Article. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this Article to be submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Administrator.
20-109 Conflicting Regulations:
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this Article and any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict is with respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.

The flood hazard areas of Pittsburg, Kansas, are subject to inundation, which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 92
2. These flood losses are caused by:
a. The cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways, causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
b. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others and which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages.
3. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis for this Article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of inter-related steps, as follows:
a. Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The regulatory flood selected for this Ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this Ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative materials to become effective June 16, 1995, and any future revision thereto.(Sec 1, Ord G-755, 8/4/95)
b. Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
c. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height.
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood.
21-103 General Provisions:
1. Land to which Regulations Apply: This Article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of Pittsburg, Kansas, identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as numbered and unnumbered A Zones, AE Zones, and within the Zoning Districts "FW" and "FF" established in Section 21-105 herein and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Article, no development shall be permitted except upon a permit granted by the Zoning Administrator under the provisions established in Section 21-106 of this Article.
2. The Enforcement Officer: The Zoning Administrator of Pittsburg, Kansas, is designated as the enforcement officer to administer and implement the provisions of this Article. Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
a. Review all applications for floodplain development permits to assure the sites are reasonably safe from flooding and that the floodplain development permit requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 93
b. Review all applications for floodplain development permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.
c. Review all subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
d. Issue floodplain development permits for all approved applications.
e. Notify adjacent communities and the Division of Water Resources, Kansas Department of Agriculture, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
f. Assure that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished and shall be maintained within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse.
g. Verify and maintain a record of the actual (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor, including basement, or all new or substantially improved structures.

i. When flood proofing techniques are utilized for a particular non-residential structure, the floodplain administrator shall require certification from a registered professional engineer or architect.
3. Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries: The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the FIRM, as, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Zoning Appeals will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires. (Sec 2, Ord. G-724, 12/31/93)

"Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
19. Habitable Floor: Any floor used for living, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation or combination thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a "habitable floor."
20. Highest Adjacent Grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
21. Historic Structures: Any structure that is: (Sec 5, Ord G-724, 12/31/93)

(d) Individually listed on a local inventory of preservation programs that have been certified either:
(1) By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or
(2) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
22. Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a buildings lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable flood-proofing design requirements of this ordinance.
23. Manufactured Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include "recreational vehicles". This definition shall apply to the requirements of Article 21 only and shall not have a bearing on any other requirements of these Regulations. (Sec 5, Ord G-724, 12/31/93)
24. Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. These types of activities are also referred to in these Regulations as Mobile Home Park and Mobile Home Subdivision and, as such, must comply with all the other requirements of these Regulations.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 106
25. New Construction: Structures for which the "start of construction" or substantial improvement is commenced on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM. (Sec 5, Ord. G-724, 12/31/93)
26. One Hundred (100) Year Flood (aka Base Flood): The base flood having a 1 percent chance of annual occurrence.
27. Overlay District: A district which acts in conjunction with the underlying zoning district or districts. The original zoning district designation does not change.

(b) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
(c) Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(d) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. This definition shall apply to the requirements of Article 21 only and shall not have a bearing on any other requirements of these Regulations.
29. Regulatory Flood Elevation: An elevation 1 foot higher than the water surface elevation of the regulatory flood.
30. Start of Construction (Including Substantial Improvements): The date the building permit, or other authorization granted by the City, was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit or authorization date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of the slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings such as garages, sheds or agricultural accessory buildings not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building or structure.(Sec 5, Ord G-724, 12/31/93)
31. Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
32. Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include:
a. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 107
Building Official (or his/her designee) and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
b. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.

23-101 Purpose:
The procedures and requirements set forth in this Article, or the requirements set forth
elsewhere in this Ordinance when referred to in this Article, are for the "P" Planned zoning
districts, a PUD Planned Unit Development, or Conditional Use Permits designated
elsewhere in this Ordinance. These requirements are specifically intended to
accommodate:
1. The fully planned, coordinated, and orderly development of relatively large tracts of
land into a PUD Planned Unit Development.
2. The planned, coordinated, and orderly development of properties to a use in the P
Planned zoning districts.
3. The redevelopment or change in use of a tract of land that was zoned in a "P Planned
zoning district at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance but which has never had
an approved development plan.
4. The consideration of an application for a Conditional Use under the provisions of this
Ordinance.
The erection, construction, reconstruction, moving or altering on an individual lot or
property of a single-family, two-family, or three-family residential unit shall not be subject
to the provisions of this Article, regardless of the zone in which such unit is placed. The
requirements and regulations herein prescribed pertaining to height, open space, setbacks,
parking, loading, and signs may be adjusted or modified so that the property in question
may be developed in a reasonable manner and, at the same time, will not be detrimental
to the public welfare and the interests of the community, but in keeping with the general
intent and spirit of this Ordinance. Such adjustments or modifications may be made as a
part of the rezoning or Conditional Use process, or may be allowed after approval by the
Planning Commission upon request of the applicant.
23-102 Application, Review, Approval Procedure:
In order to assure that proposed rezoning to a "P" Planned zoning district or PUD Planned
Unit Development and proposed uses requiring Conditional Use permits meet the
requirements of this Ordinance and will be compatible with surrounding properties and
uses, it is hereby required that all applications for one of the "Planned" districts, a PUD
Planned Unit Development, or a Conditional Use permit, except those uses exempted in
Section 23-101, above, include a development plan which must be approved as specified
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 114
within this Article prior to any construction on the property. The "Planned" Districts subject
to this Article are:
"RP-3 Planned Medium Density Residential District
"RP-4" Planned Apartment House District
"CP-O" Planned Commercial Office District
"CP-1" Planned Neighborhood Commercial District
"CP-2" Planned General Commercial District
"CP-3" Planned Highway Service Commercial District
"CP-4" Planned Central Business District
"IP-1" Planned Light Industrial District
"IP-2" Planned Medium Industrial District
"IP-3" Planned Heavy Industrial District
"AP" Planned Airport Industrial District
The procedure for approval of a development plan shall consist of the following:
1. Application for a:
a. "P Planned district, designating which zone or zones to be utilized, or
b. Conditional Use permit, or
c. PUD Planned Unit Development, and;
2. A development plan.
For proposals for new construction, the development plan shall be submitted at the time
the application is submitted for the P Planned zoning district, a PUD Planned Unit
Development, or a Conditional Use and no application shall be deemed complete nor set
for public hearing until said development plan is submitted. No building permit shall be
issued for property in a P Planned Zoning District, in a PUD Planned Unit Development,
or for a Conditional Use Permit until the property has been zoned and the development
plan for the entire property and / or each phase of development has been approved in
accordance with the provision of this Ordinance. Properties classified in a P Planned
zoning district at the time of the initial adoption of the Ordinance may change users or
construct additions to existing buildings without the necessity of obtaining a development
plan approval if the Zoning Administrator deems such improvements are within the spirit
and intent of the underlying zoning classification. Any construction for the first time on the
properties classified in a P Planned zoning district at the time of adopting of this ordinance
must have a development plan approved as provided herein prior to any building permit
being issued, provided that such approval shall not require a public hearing but be acted
upon by the Planning Commission consistent with all other provisions of this Ordinance.
23-103 Development Plan:
Application for a "P Planned zoning district, PUD Planned Unit Development, or a
Conditional Use, and development plan approval shall be made in accordance with the
procedures outlined in Article 37 of this Ordinance. The application shall include a
development plan which describes the applicant's intentions for the use and development
of the property. The development plan shall include and/or display the following
information:
1. Property site map drawn to scale of 1" = 20' or greater, indicating the legal description,
property boundary, existing utilities and easements, and natural and man-made
features of the property.
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 115
a. A certified topographic survey at no more than 2-foot contour drawn to same scale
as the property site map shall be provided when either the Zoning Administrator or
the City Engineer determines the development will substantially increase the runoff
coefficient, alter the direction of drainage flow from the property or might obstruct
traffic visibility.
2. A development plan, drawn to the same scale as the property site map, indicating:
a. Existing contours (shown as dashed lines);
b. Proposed contours (shown as solid lines);
c. Location and orientation of all existing and proposed buildings;
d. Areas to be used for parking, including the number and arrangement of stalls;
e. Areas to be developed for screening, including the location of plant materials, and
screening structures and features;
f. Pedestrian and vehicular circulation, and their relationship to existing streets,
alleys and public right-of-way;
g. Points of ingress and egress;
h. Location of all existing and proposed utilities (sanitary sewage systems, water
systems, storm drainage systems, gas lines, telephone lines and electrical power
lines);
i. Drainage controls (retention or detention ponds);
j. Location, size and characteristics of identification and business signs;
k. Lighting layout, appurtenances, and intensity of illumination;
l. Proposed finished floor elevations of all buildings and structures.
3. A statement of intent shall accompany the preliminary development plan to explain the
measures used to achieve compatibility of the proposed development with surrounding
properties through the planning of the site and the location and design of structures. Such
a statement of intent will also address the anticipated schedule of development, including
any phasing of development over time.
The Plan Approval Guidelines, including site plan submission and content requirements,
are contained in Article 23 of this Ordinance.
23-104 Development Plan-Review, Approval:
The Planning Commission shall review the application along with the development plan
and may recommend approval or denial of the development plan, or request modifications
to the development plan as deemed necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of this
Ordinance. Approval by the Planning Commission shall constitute approval and
permanency of the development plan, thereby establishing the criteria for construction of
the proposed development. In the process of reviewing any development plan, the
Planning Commission may provide approval of the development plan conditioned upon
certain limitations or restrictions deemed necessary to protect the public interest and
surrounding properties, including, if any, the following:
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 116
1. Limitations on the type, illumination and appearance of any signs or advertising
structures.
2. Direction and location of outdoor lighting.
3. Arrangement and location of off-street parking and off-street loading spaces.
4. The type of paving, landscaping, fencing, screening and other such features.
5. Limitations on structural alterations to existing buildings.
6. Plans for control or elimination of smoke, dust, gas, noise or vibration caused by the
proposed use.
7. Waiver of any standards, requirements or depiction of information required by this Article
when requested by the applicant and shown to be unnecessary as applied to the specific
case in question.
8. Such other conditions and/or limitations that are deemed necessary.
The total number of dwelling units and level of nonresidential development allowed within
a PUD shall not exceed the level that can be adequately served by public facilities. To
provide information on the capacity of the streets and other facilities serving the PUD, the
Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, and/or Governing Body may require the
applicant to conduct a traffic impact study or other infrastructure capacity analysis to
provide information on the proposed developments expected impacts on existing and
planned facilities.
23-105 Development Plan - Phasing, Time Restrictions:
The applicant may proceed with construction based on the entire development plan, or
may elect to develop the property in phases. The applicant may submit the development
plan separately for the first and each successive phase of construction, or for the entire
project with a depiction of the phasing sequence; however, all P Planned zoning districts,
PUD Planned Unit Development, and conditional uses approved with a development plan
shall have construction begun within one (1) year of said approval by the Planning
Commission. The applicant may request a one (1) year extension of this time restriction by
submitting a request in writing to the Planning Commission stating the reasons construction
has not begun and at what time construction is expected to begin. If the Planning
Commission agrees, the one (1) year extension may be granted one time but shall not be
granted for any longer period.
The Planning Commission shall review the development plan and shall act on said plan in
a reasonable time period following the submission of the plan. Upon approval by the
Planning Commission, the development plan shall be filed for record in the office of the
Zoning Administrator.
After the development plan has been approved, and when in the course of carrying out the
development plan, minor adjustments are requested by the applicant and such adjustments
conform to the minimum standards established by the approved development plan for
building coverage, parking spaces, points of ingress and/or egress, heights, setbacks
and/or other requirements, such adjustments may be made by the Zoning Administrator. If
the requested adjustments are deemed by the Zoning Administrator to exceed the
minimum standards established by the approved development plan, the revised
development plan must be submitted and approved by the Planning Commission before
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 117
any further work can proceed. At no time shall the zoning or conditional use previously
approved be subject to disapproval. The only issue in said review shall be the requested
revisions to the previously approved development plan.
23-106 Appeals of Planning Commission Action on Development Plans:
Any decision of the Planning Commission regarding development plans may be appealed
to the Governing Body, whose decision shall be final. An appeal shall be filed in writing
with the Zoning Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days following the date of the
Planning Commission's final action. If no appeal is taken within that time, the decision of
the Planning Commission shall be final. The appeal shall set forth the basis for the appeal
and the relief sought by the applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall schedule the appeal
before the Governing Body no later than thirty (30) days following the filing of the appeal.
The Zoning Administrator shall notify all interested persons in writing of the time and place
of the Governing Body's meeting at least ten (10) days prior to said meeting.
23-107 Remedies for Noncompliance:
If the applicant fails to comply with the time requirements herein established, the approved
development plan shall be declared null and void and no permit for construction shall be
issued until a new development plan has been approved following the procedures
previously cited. The P Planned zoning district, PUD Planned Unit Development, or
Conditional Use permit shall remain in effect but shall do so without an approved
development plan. If the approved development plan is violated and then voided, either the
Planning Commission or the Governing Body may initiate an action to have the zoning
changed to the previous zoning classification, or to have the Conditional Use permit
revoked, or may seek some other more restrictive zoning classification by following the
procedures outlined in this Ordinance.

25-105 Performance Standards:
1. All off-street parking spaces, and their access drives required for all multi-family
residential, commercial and industrial uses shall be paved with an asphalt or concrete
surface and shall be maintained in good condition and free of all weeds, dust, trash
and other debris. The paving shall be completed before the activity or use can
commence.
However, the Planning Commission may waive this requirement in an industrial district
upon the applicant's request, provided the applicant can provide sufficient reasons and
can show that such action would be in the community's best interest and would be
keeping with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance, and would not be detrimental to the
applicant's neighborhood. (Sec 5, Ord G-811, 7/31/98)
2. All off-street parking spaces, and their access drives for one- and two-family residential
uses, shall be covered with an all-weather surface in such depth as to prevent rutting
in the wettest conditions and shall be maintained in good condition and free of all
weeds, trash and other debris. Compacted soil shall not be considered as an allweather
surface. (Sec 5, Ord G-811, 7/31/98)
3. All off-street parking spaces, and their access drives, shall be planned and engineered
to assure proper drainage of surface water. If a public storm sewer is available,
drainage from such lot or parcel of land shall be conveyed to such sewer in a manner
approved by the Public Works Department. If a storm sewer is not available, positive
drainage shall be provided for on such lot or parcel and discharge the same through
defined drainage courses. No drainage shall be directed over adjoining lands unless
approved by the Director of Public Works.
4. The Planning Commission or the Governing Body may require plans to be prepared
and presented to assure proper design and construction of any off-street parking
spaces and their access drives, if conditions of the site are such that compliance with
these requirements may be difficult or may pose a potential problem with adjacent
properties, or if the proposed use will include parking needs for buses, tractor-trailer
semis, or other such large vehicles. Additional spaces may be required or reserved to
accommodate such vehicles and the Planning Commission or Governing Body may
require that the site plan show the location of such spaces.
5. When located in a residential district, required off-street parking shall not be permitted
within a front yard setback. (Sec 5, Ord G-811, 7/31/98)
6. If lighting facilities are provided, they shall be so arranged as to deflect or direct light
away from any adjacent single-family residence, two-family residence or multi-family
residence.
7. Parking areas shall have adequate guards to prevent the extension or the overhanging
of vehicles beyond property lines or parking spaces; and parking areas shall be
adequately marked with at least two (2) inch wide stripes of traffic paint, for
channelization and movement of vehicles.
8. No business shall be conducted on any parking lot except when conducted in
compliance with this Ordinance.

regulations as it may deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Ordinance.
34-102 Powers:
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers:
1. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order,

such Board is required to pass under this Ordinance.
3. In accordance with the specific provisions of this Article, to authorize upon appeal of
specific cases such variance from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of this Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.
34-103 Variances:
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to grant the following variances:
1. A variation in the yard requirements in any district so as to relieve practical difficulties or

shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, at the time of the enactment of such
regulations or restrictions or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situations or conditions of such piece of property, the strict
application of each regulation or restriction would result in peculiar and exceptional
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 194
practical difficulties to, or exceptional hardship upon the owner of such property. Such
grant or variance shall comply, as nearly as possible, in every respect with the spirit,
intent and purpose of the zoning regulations, it being the purpose of this provision to
authorize the granting of variation only for reasons of demonstrable and exceptional
hardship as distinguished from variations sought by applicants for purposes or reasons
of convenience, profit, or caprice. Such variance shall be granted only when public safety
and welfare are secured and substantial justice done.
2. A request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the board that

37-105 LIMITATIONS ON REAPPLICATION FOR AMENDMENTS: .........................................207
37-101 Who May Petition or Apply:
Applications for amendments, revisions or changes in the Zoning District Boundary Map in
effect for Pittsburg, Kansas, or for a Conditional Use Permit, may be made by any person
who owns the land for which such an amendment, revision, change or conditional use permit
is sought, or by the owner's agent as defined by this Ordinance. If such application is made
by the owner's agent, said agent shall enter upon the application the name and current
mailing address of the owner and shall submit written authorization to act as agent for said
owner prior to any public hearing.
Recommendations for amendments, revisions or changes to the Zoning Ordinance or the
Zoning District Boundary Map may also be made by the Planning Commission upon its own
motion, for final determination by the Governing Body; likewise the Governing Body may
amend the Zoning Ordinance or the Zoning District Boundary Map upon its own motion;
provided, however, such proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the Planning
Commission for recommendation and report as provided herein.
37-102 Procedures for Consideration of Request for Amendments,
Revisions or Changes:
All applications or requests for amendments, revisions or changes to the Zoning Ordinance
or the Zoning District Boundary Map or for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made to the
Zoning Administrator on such forms as provided and acceptable to the Zoning Administrator
and the payment of the application fee established by the Governing Body. Immediately upon
receipt of an application for rezoning or conditional use by the owner of a particular tract of
land, or his agent, and the payment of the appropriate fee, the Zoning Administrator shall
note thereon the date of filing and make a permanent record thereof. All such applications
shall be set down for hearing not later than 60 days after receipt of a completed application.
Notice of such hearing shall be published once in the official City newspaper at least 20 days
prior to the date set for said hearing and a hearing shall be granted to any person at the time
and place specified in such notice. In addition to such publication notice, notice of such
proposed hearing shall be mailed to all the owners of land located within 200 feet of the area
proposed to be altered at least 10 days prior to the hearing, thus providing an opportunity to
all interested parties to be heard. Such notice shall be given by regular first class mail, and
shall be in the form of a letter explaining the proposed change. Such mailed notices shall be
addressed to the owners of land mentioned above and not to occupants of such lands. The
applicant shall provide a certified list of the owners of said lands at the time of the filing of the
application. The applicant shall furnish proof that he is the owner, the owner's agent, or has
an option to buy the land described in the application, in which case the present owner must
consent in writing to the application prior to the public hearing. In the case of an application
to amend, revise or change the Zoning Ordinance, whether by an individual, the Planning
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 206
Commission or the Governing Body, all the above stated requirements shall be followed
except:
1. No fee shall be required if the request is from the Planning Commission or the
Governing Body.
2. Notice of the public hearing shall not be required to be mailed to all affected persons;
therefore, a certified list of the owners of land shall not be required.
For action on zoning amendments, a quorum of the Planning Commission is more than onehalf
of all the members. A vote either for or against an amendment by a majority of all the
Planning Commission members present constitutes a recommendation of the Planning
Commission; whereas a vote either for or against an amendment by less than a majority of
all the members of the Planning Commission present constitutes a "failure to recommend."
When the Planning Commission submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of
such amendment, the Governing Body may either adopt such recommendation by ordinance
or take no further action thereof, as appropriate. In the event the Planning Commission
submits a "failure to recommend" to the Governing Body, the Governing Body may take such
action as it deems appropriate. Upon receipt of a recommendation of the Planning
Commission which the Governing Body disapproves, the Governing Body shall return such
recommendation to the Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for
disapproval. The Planning Commission, after reconsidering the same, may resubmit its
original recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit new and amended
recommendations. Upon receipt of such recommendations, the Governing Body may adopt
or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by resolution, or it need take no
further action thereon. If the Planning Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the
Governing Body within 10 days after receipt of the Governing Body's statement specifying
disapproval, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the
Planning Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed
accordingly. The Planning Commission shall submit its first recommendation, in whatever
form, no later than 3 months after the first public hearing.
If the zoning amendment shall affect the boundaries of any zone or district, the resolution of
the Governing Body shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the
official map to be changed to reflect such amendment and shall reincorporate such map as
amended. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves
a proposed zoning amendment or "fails to recommend," if a protest against an amendment,
supplement or change is filed in the office of City Clerk within 14 days after the date of the
conclusion of the public hearing duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent
or more of any property proposed to be rezoned, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of
the total area, excepting public streets and highways, which is located within 200 feet of the
boundaries of the property proposed to be rezoned, such amendment shall not be passed
except by three-fourths majority vote of the Governing Body.
37-103 Posting of Sign:
Each applicant for a rezoning and each applicant for a Conditional Use Permit shall, within
48 hours of filing such application, place a sign upon the lot, tract or parcel of land for which
the application was filed. Said sign shall be furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the
applicant and the applicant shall firmly affix and attach the sign to a wood or metal backing
or frame and place the sign as hereinafter set forth. Said sign shall read as follows:
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 207
REZONING PENDING
(or)
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PENDING
Application Number ________
From ___________________________ To ___________________________
PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE THE
PITTSBURG PLANNING COMMISSION
on
(date) on (time)
NOTE: Unauthorized Removal, Defacing, or Destruction
of this Sign Punishable upon Conviction by
Fine not exceeding $100.00 and/or not more
than thirty (30) days imprisonment.
Said sign shall be maintained and kept in place by the applicant until final disposition of such
application, or until withdrawal of the application. The sign shall be removed by the applicant
after final action on the application.
The bottom of said sign shall be a minimum of two (2) feet above the ground line. Said sign
shall be placed within five (5) feet of the street right-of-way line, in a position on such lot, tract
or parcel of land as to have no visual obstructions thereto and to be readily seen by
passersby. If the lot, tract or parcel of land has more than one (1) street abutting thereto,
signs shall be placed facing both streets. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not
deprive the Planning Commission of its jurisdiction or affect any decision, but may be due
cause for the Planning Commission to refuse to hear the application or to adjourn the hearing
or to require further notice. Any such hearing may, for good cause at the request of the
applicant, or in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be continued.
37-104 Traffic Studies:
In the case of an application for rezoning of land or for a conditional use permit for a use
which may, in the opinion of the Planning Commission or Governing Body, substantially
change traffic patterns, or create traffic congestion, either the Planning Commission or
Governing Body may require that the applicant procure the services of a competent
professional traffic engineer for the purpose of preparing a traffic study. Such traffic study
shall show that the traffic generated by the proposed development will be handled on the site
in an orderly and efficient manner, that vehicular ingress and egress from the site onto public
streets will function in an orderly and efficient manner and that no undue burden will be placed
upon the existing public street system. The results of the traffic study shall be used in
determining the impact of the proposed rezoning or conditional use permit and guide the
development of a recommendation or decision regarding the same.
37-105 Limitations on Reapplication for Amendments:
Whenever an application for amendment, supplement, change, rezoning or conditional use
permit has been denied by the Governing Body, such application or one substantially similar
shall not be reconsidered sooner than ninety (90) days after the said denial.

40-101 Purpose:
It is recognized that good landscaping increases property values, assists with storm water
runoff and retention, attracts potential residents and businesses to the city, and creates an
attractive environment for all residents and visitors. The purpose of these regulations is to
use landscape elements, particularly plant materials, in an organized manner that will
improve storm water absorption, protect and improve the aesthetics of the City of Pittsburg,
and enhance the safety, comfort and enjoyment of its citizens.
The City recognizes the value of landscaping in achieving the following goals:
1. Encourage the preservation of existing trees;
2. Provide an overall planting scheme that will reduce soil erosion and the volume and
rate of discharge of storm water runoff;
3. Establish and enhance a visual character and structure to the built environment that
is pleasant to view and is sensitive to safety and aesthetics;
4. Promote compatibility between land uses by reducing noise, glare, heat, and lighting
impacts of specific development on users of a site and its abutting properties;
5. Provide visual screens and buffers that mitigate the impact of conflicting land uses;
6. Aid in energy conservation by shading and sheltering structures from energy losses
caused by weather conditions;
7. Mitigate the loss of natural resources;
8. Provide shade, comfort, and seasonal color.
These regulations are minimum landscaping standards. Owners and developers are
encouraged to exceed these standards with more creative solutions, not only for the
Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations 214
enhanced value of their land, but also for the health and enjoyment of all citizens of the City
of Pittsburg.

1-101 Title and Scope:
This Ordinance, entitled the Pittsburg Subdivision Ordinance, prescribes minimum design
requirements and approval procedures for the development of new subdivisions and
resubdivisions of land in Pittsburg, Kansas.
1-102 Purpose:
The division and improvement of land for urban or nonagricultural development has a significant
and lasting impact upon the physical environment of Pittsburg, Kansas, and it places increasing
demands upon public facilities and services. The creation of new streets, lots and utility systems
requires significant public and private capital investments. Failure to properly size and construct
adequate sewers and streets, ensure available water supplies, manage storm water runoff and
erosion, and plan for public services may result in physical and environmental problems which
are difficult and costly to resolve.
This Ordinance sets forth uniform rules and procedures for the division and improvement of real
property to assure that new subdivisions are properly planned and integrated with existing
streets, utilities and other public facilities systems; to prevent potential environmental hazards;
and to coordinate the use of private and public resources to achieve planned and orderly land
development through proper location and design of streets, building lines, open spaces, and
utilities; and to establish standards by which streets, utilities and other physical improvements
shall be erected, constructed or installed.
1-103 Applicability:
This Ordinance shall apply to any person desiring to do any of the following:
1. Subdivide or further subdivide any lot or tract of land into two or more parts.
2. Resubdivide any lot or tract of land that has previously been subdivided into two or more
parts.
3. Establish any street, alley, sidewalk, park or other property intended for public use or for
the use of prospective or existing owners of lots or tracts of land fronting on or adjacent to
such property.
The owner(s) of any land located within Pittsburg, Kansas, subdividing said land in a manner
previously cited shall cause to be prepared a subdivision plat in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. No building permit shall hereafter be issued by Pittsburg, Kansas, for construction
on any land that has not been subdivided in compliance with this Ordinance and all other
applicable state laws and Pittsburg ordinances in effect at the time of the subdivision of said land.
1-104 Exemptions:
This Ordinance shall not apply in the following instances or transactions:
1. Any lot or tract of land located within the area governed by this Ordinance that has been
legally subdivided or platted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
2. The division or further division of land into tracts of 20 acres or more when subdivided
only for agricultural purposes, when it does not entail the establishment of a new
residential dwelling, and when it does not involve or result in the creation of any new
streets, easements of access or other dedication.
3. A transaction between owners of adjoining tracts of land or lots which involves only a
change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons, provided no additional
lots are created and such tracts of land or lots comply with the design requirements for
lots in Section 4-104 of this Ordinance and applicable provisions of the Pittsburg Zoning
Ordinance.
4. The use of land for right-of-way by railroads or public utilities subject to local, state or
federal regulations, provided no new street is created or involved.
5. The division of a tract of land or lot which creates no more than one additional tract or lot
subject to the provisions for tract or lot splits described in Article 3 of this Ordinance and
provided such division does not involve the creation of any new streets or easements of
access and such newly created tracts or lots comply with the design requirements for lots
in Section 4-104 of this Ordinance and applicable provisions of the Pittsburg Zoning
Ordinance. Any further division of the lots or tracts of land shall be platted in compliance
with the requirements of this Ordinance.

ARTICLE 2 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISIONS 2-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS.................................................................................................13 2-102 PRE-PLATTING CONFERENCE......................................................................................13 2-103 PRELIMINARY PLAT: ......................................................................................................14 2-104 FINAL PLAT:......................................................................................................................15 2-105 SHORT-FORM PLAT: .......................................................................................................18 2-101 General Provisions: This Article establishes uniform procedures and platting requirements for subdivisions subject to this Ordinance. No final plat shall be filed or recorded with the County Register of Deeds as required by law unless and until it has been acted upon by the Planning Commission and approved by the Governing Body as required herein. 2-102 Pre-Platting Conference: Any person desiring to subdivide land into five or more lots shall be required to attend a pre-platting conference with the Zoning Administrator as a first step to filing an application for a preliminary plat. Owners of proposed subdivisions of less than five lots are encouraged to hold a pre-platting conference; however, it is not mandatory and they may proceed with filing a preliminary plat. Arrangements for this conference shall be made by contacting the Zoning Administrator. The purpose of the pre-platting conference is to inform the city staff of possible future subdivisions so that the staff may determine and inform the applicant of the effect, feasibility and compatibility of the proposal in relation to Pittsburg's utility and street system and any City development policies and plans. The conference enables the staff to inform owners and their agents of the general conformance or nonconformance of the subdivision proposal with this Ordinance, identify additional requirements for further processing of the proposal, and to advise them of applicable zoning provisions or conflicts and special design considerations presented by particular environmental features on or affecting the site (i.e. flood plains, excessive slope areas, soil problems, high water tables, etc.). The landowner or his representative may, if he deems it desirable, prepare a schematic drawing of the proposed subdivision in order to receive any pre-plat comments of the staff which may prove helpful in designing the preliminary plat. The sketch plan should convey the location of the proposed subdivision; the general layout of the proposed subdivision including the location and size of streets and the orientation, number and dimensions of the lots; plans for water supply and sanitary sewage disposal; and any particular design problems posed by the existing natural or man-made conditions and characteristics of the site which could benefit from an early discussion. In addition to the Zoning Administrator and representatives of the owner(s) intending to subdivide the land, principal participants involved in the pre-platting conference may include representatives of the Pittsburg Public Works Department and other persons and agencies as applicable. No verbal, written or schematically illustrated statements made during the course of the conference shall be held as legally binding or construed in any way as granting or assuring approval of the proposed subdivision since the Governing Body has final authority on all subdivision plats upon action from the Planning Commission.
2-103 Preliminary Plat:
1. Application : A subdivision application form shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and
shall be accompanied by 20 copies of the preliminary plat. The appropriate fee shall be paid

He shall then place the preliminary plat on the agenda for consideration at the first available meeting of the Planning Commission. 4. General City Staff and Utility Review: The Zoning Administrator shall distribute copies of the preliminary plat to the appropriate Pittsburg city departments and agencies and the affected utility companies for review and comment. All general staff and utility review comments shall be coordinated by the Zoning Administrator and shall be forwarded along with a report and recommendation to the Planning Commission. 5. Planning Commission Review and Action: The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat for compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance. After reviewing the preliminary plat based on the objectives and requirements of this Ordinance, comments from concerned citizens, and the report from the Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission shall take action on the acceptance, modification or rejection of the preliminary plat. Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission shall permit the applicant to proceed with the filing of a final plat as described in Section 2-104. The Zoning Administrator shall forward a statement of the action taken by the Planning Commission to the Governing Body. The Governing Body, at its request, may require that it must approve the preliminary plat before the applicant can submit a final plat. 6. Effect of Approved Preliminary Plat: Approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute final acceptance of the subdivision by Pittsburg. It establishes the overall layout and design of the proposed subdivision and authorizes the applicant to prepare a final plat. Any deviation of the final plat from the intent of the approved preliminary plat as determined by the Planning Commission shall be disallowed and shall cause the re-initiation of the preliminary platting process. The applicant shall file a final plat application along with the required documents described in Section 2-104 within three (3) years of the approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission and/or Governing Body. Upon failure to do so within the time specified, approval of the preliminary plat is null and void, unless an extension of time, limited to six (6) months, is applied for by the developer and granted by the Planning Commission. An extension shall be granted only once. 2-104 Final Plat: 1. Application: The final platting process is intended to provide a complete surveyed drawing of the subdivision for the purpose of providing a legal record of lots, streets, areas for dedication and easements for future reference and transactions. The final plat submitted may be for all of the property approved in the preliminary plat or may be for only a portion or "phase" thereof. The applicant shall file 20 copies of the final plat with the Zoning Administrator along with the additional information required herein. Said final plat shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor, and so sealed. In addition to the 20 copies, one (1) original final plat shall be submitted at least ten (10) days prior to the Planning Commission meeting.

4-101 Applicability:
All subdivisions of land subject to this Ordinance shall conform to the following minimum design
standards. Such design criteria shall govern the approval of subdivision plats by the Planning
Commission and the Governing Body. All plats shall be prepared under the direct supervision of a
registered engineer or land surveyor of the State of Kansas, and all submittals shall bear the seal
of said registered engineer or land surveyor.
All subdivisions shall be platted with due consideration toward sound traffic engineering
principles, safe and accessible building sites, adequate methods of storm water drainage and
provisions for a sanitary water supply and effective sewage disposal system. All subdivision plats
shall be consistent with applicable City development plans and policies and shall be coordinated
with existing, planned or committed public improvements. All subdivision plats shall comply with
all local, state and federal laws and regulations.
4-102 Street Standards:
The arrangement, character, extent and location of all streets shall conform to the following
Sections: (Sec 3, Ord G-826, 4/30/99)
4-102.1 Comprehensive Plan Compliance: The arrangement, character, extent, and location
of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan or other plans and standards as
adopted.
4-102.2 External Street Considerations: The arrangement, alignment, and width of streets in
new subdivisions shall be properly integrated with the existing principal street or road
system and where appropriate shall provide for the continuation of existing principal
streets in adjoining subdivisions or their projection where adjoining property is not
platted. In no case shall the width of streets in new subdivisions be less than the
minimum street widths established in this Article.
4-102.3 Internal Street Layout, General: The location, arrangement, character and type of all
streets shall be designed in relation to topographical conditions, the extent and impact
of storm water runoff, the safe and convenient circulation of traffic within the subdivision
and the uses of the land to be served by such streets. When possible, local streets
shall be planned so as to discourage through traffic and to conveniently channel traffic
onto collector and arterial streets.
4-102.4 Internal Street Layout, Residential Development: The use of curvilinear streets, culde-
sacs, u-shaped streets, or cluster developments shall be encouraged in residential
areas when appropriate. However, the excessive use of cul-de-sacs shall be
discouraged. No streets shall be laid out so as to intersect with themselves, unless
topographic conditions warrant.
4-102.5 Internal Street Layout, Non-Residential Development: In commercial or industrial
developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with
the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, the provision of alleys, truck loading
and maneuvering areas, walks, and parking areas as to minimize conflict of movement
between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4-102.6 Street Intersections: Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, except where topography or other natural conditions justify a variation.
However, in no instances shall two streets intersect at an interior angle of less than 75
degrees without written consent of the City Engineer.
4-102.7 Multiple Intersections: Intersections involving the junction of more than two (2) streets
shall be avoided whenever possible.
4-102.8 Intersection Curvature: When connecting streets deflect from each other with an
interior angle of less than 75 degrees they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than two hundred (200) feet for local
and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the City Engineer shall determine for
arterial streets.
4-102.9 Curb Radii and Vision Triangle: Street pavement at intersections shall be rounded by
the following minimum radii:
Street Classification Intersection With Minimum Curb Radii
Arterial or Collector Arterial or Collector 25 feet
Local Arterial 25 feet
Local Collector or Local 20 feet
The Planning Commission may set specifications for curb radii, upon advice of the City
Engineer, greater than the minimum standards herein.
4-102.10 Offset Streets: Offset streets whose centerlines are separated by less than 150 feet
shall be avoided, except where topography or other conditions justify a variation.
4-102.11 Reserve Strips (aka Spite Strip): There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to
streets. The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide each lot, by means of either
a public street or way or permanent easement, with satisfactory access to an existing
public highway or street.
4-102.12 Private Streets: There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision.
4-102.13 Travel Easements: The Planning Commission may approve a Travel Easement to be substituted for a public street where it is deemed necessary or advantageous. Such easement shall include covenants, running in favor of the City related to future construction and maintenance, and shall be designed to the proper standards as set out in this Ordinance, unless otherwise allowed by the Planning Commission. Travel easements are to be for the shared access (driveway) by not more than two (2) lots. 4-102.14 Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this Ordinance and where the Planning Commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 4-102.15 Visibility: Clear visibility, measured along the centerline of a street, shall be provided for at least two hundred (200) feet on all streets. 4-102.16 Access to Arterials: a. Where a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed limited access arterial, the Planning Commission may require a street system design which affords separation of through and local traffic. This may be accomplished through reverse frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service areas, or frontage roads. b. Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may require that access to such streets be limited by any of the following means: (1) The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial street and front onto a parallel local street. No access shall be provided directly to any lot from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided by the developer in a screening easement along the rear property lines of such lots. (2) A series of cul-de-sacs, u-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the street lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial street.

Prior to and as a condition of approval of any final plat by the Governing Body, the developer
shall agree to install or provide for the installation of certain improvements within the proposed
subdivision. Such improvements installed by the developer shall comply with the standards and
specifications of the City, utility company or public agency having jurisdiction and shall be subject
to any applicable surety requirements to guarantee their proper installation.
5-102 Required Improvements:
Every developer shall install, or through the appropriate public agency and/or utility company
provide for the installation of the following improvements in accordance with the conditions and
specifications required herein:
1. Water Supply and Sewage Disposal:
a. Water Supply:
(1) Where an approved public water supply is reasonably accessible or procurable, the
developer shall contract with the City of Pittsburg Water Department to make the water
supply available for each lot within the subdivided area.
(2) In a proposed subdivision, pending accessibility of a public water supply, the subdivider
may be required to construct wells or a private water supply system in such a manner
that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision at
the time improvements are erected thereon. The adequacy, healthfulness, and potability
of the water supply shall be subject to the approval of the State Board of Health. The
construction of the water supply system shall be subject to the approval of the City
Engineer.
(3) The developer shall also contract with the City Public Works Department for the
installation, maintenance, and operation of fire hydrants in accordance with the City
requirements.

(1) Where the sanitary sewer system of the City is reasonably accessible, and the subdivision
is within the city limits of the City of Pittsburg, each lot within the subdivided area shall be
provided with a connection thereto. All connections shall be subject to the approval of the
City, and any subdivided area not within the city limits shall not connect its sewers with
the sanitary sewer system of the City without express permission of the Governing Body.
(2) In subdivisions beyond the city limits, in which the lots are less than one (1) acre in area,
and where plans for the installation of sanitary sewers in the vicinity of a subdivision have
been prepared by the City Engineer, the developer may be required to install sanitary
sewers in conformity with such plans. In such cases, until a connection can be made with
the public sanitary sewer system, the use of a central sewage treatment system will be
permitted, provided such treatment system is approved by the City Engineer. Where the
installation of sanitary sewers is not required, and where the lots are more than one (1)

within the platted area. Such street improvements should adequately reflect the classification
of the particular street, its location and anticipated volume of traffic. All grades, drainage
facilities and surfacing requirements shall be constructed according to the standards and
specifications of the City.
Said construction standards are on file and available in the office of the City Engineer. All
street plans and specifications shall be approved by the City Engineer and final acceptance
of the construction of said streets shall be made by the City Engineer.
4. Inspections: All construction and installation shall be inspected by the City Engineering
Department. The developer shall pay for inspection personnel furnished by the City, under
the supervision of the City Engineer, on all improvements constructed by the developer as
contractor or subcontractor. A schedule of fees shall be prepared by the City Engineer.
5. Installation of Utility Lines & Appurtenances: The developer shall be responsible for
making the necessary arrangements with the appropriate utility companies for the installation
of utility lines and appurtenances. The installation of such utilities shall be done in such a
manner as to not interfere with other underground utilities and their installation shall be
coordinated through the City Engineer. Underground utility lines which cross underneath the
right-of-way of a street shall be installed prior to the improvement of any such street in order
to reduce the damage caused by street cuts. Incidental appurtenances, such as transformer
enclosures and meter cabinets, shall be located so as not to be hazardous to the public and
shall be approved by the City Engineer.
6. Installation of Monuments: The developer shall install monuments within the area to be
subdivided. Such monuments shall be of the size and type and placed as required by the City
Engineer.
7. Exceptions: All improvement requirements as set out within this Article shall be provided for
in all subdivisions with the following exceptions:
a. Upon specific request from the developer and concurrence of the Governing Body,
certain improvements may be waived. Such waiver may include, but not be limited to,
instances where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision and/or concerns an area
presently having any or all the required improvements as set out in Section 5-102 and
where such improvements comply with the requirements of said Section and are in
acceptable condition as determined by the City Engineer.
b. The Governing Body may make other reasonable requirements for dedications or
installations of public improvements or facilities deemed necessary to meet the public
needs caused by the new subdivision. Such additional requirements may include, but not
be limited to, the provision of park or open space land as is warranted by the reasonably
foreseeable future population and use of the area as a result of the proposed subdivision.
5-103 Financing:
1. Subdivision Improvements: A method for financing proposed improvements and a breakdown
of anticipated costs shall be submitted with the Final Plat. This shall be accomplished
by filing a Subdivision Improvements Agreement or a Benefit District Petition, and shall be
required for all subdivisions of land except for Tract or Lot Splits which require no
improvements. The Governing Body shall have sole responsibility to accept or reject the
Subdivision Improvement Agreement or Benefit District Petition. Financing methods may
include, but are not limited to, the following guarantees.
a. Petition for Establishment of a Benefit District: The percentage split of costs shall be
based on the policy established by the Governing Body. The City may decide not to
participate in Benefit Districts that do not comply with the Capital Improvements Program,
those that are located contiguous to existing City limits, or those which are inconsistent
with the Comprehensive Plan.
b. Surety Bonds: The developer shall provide the City Engineer with all calculations and
information needed to check the cost estimates of said improvements. This cost shall be
estimated by the developer and shall be verified by the City Engineer. The developer
shall then be required to obtain a security bond from a surety bonding company
authorized to do business in the State of Kansas. The bond shall be made payable to the
City of Pittsburg and shall be a percentage of the total improvements costs as
recommended by the City Engineer or such other financial assurance accepted by the
Governing Body. The duration of the bond shall be until such time as the improvements
are completed, inspected and accepted by the City.
c. Alternatives: Other financing methods may include cash or collateral, Escrow Accounts,
Property Escrow Accounts, or any other guarantee the Governing Body shall deem
acceptable.
2. Defaulting: The Governing Body may, upon advice of the City Engineer, find that the
developer is in default of the Subdivision Improvements Agreement. Such finding shall occur
at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Governing Body. Two (2) weeks prior to such
scheduled meeting, the developer shall be notified by registered mail of possible default
proceedings. At the meeting the developer shall be given the opportunity to rebut findings of default. Defaulting results from: a. Improper construction standards and specifications. b. Failure to install agreed upon improvements. c. Construction of improvements not according to agreed upon time schedule, allowing for unexpected or unavoidable delays. d. Other financial and/or contractual conditions which might lead to the developer being unable to complete the agreed upon improvements. 3. Default Proceedings: The Governing Body may find the developer not in default, extend the time limit, or: a. Should the Governing Body find the Subdivision Improvements Agreement to have been violated, it may liquidate the improvements guarantee, in whatever form it takes, and apply the proceeds of this guarantee to the construction of the improvements set out in the Subdivision Improvements Agreement. b. Should the proceeds of the guarantee not be sufficient to cover the costs of said improvements, the Governing Body may assess to the developer, property owners, or both, the construction costs of the improvements that exceed the amount provided by the developer. This may take the form of a lien against the property covered in the Subdivision Improvements Agreement. c. Should the proceeds of the guarantee exceed the actual cost of the improvements, and any cost incurred in the default procedures, the City shall return the unexpended balance to the individual named on the Subdivision Improvements Agreement as the one having secured the guarantee. 4. Guarantee Release: When all improvements have been completed and have been inspected, approved and accepted, the City shall authorize the release of the guarantee. 5-104 Relation to Plat Approval: 1. Adequate Public Facilities: Prior to approval of the Preliminary Plat, the Planning Commission shall find that sufficient public facilities and services are either available, shall be available within a reasonable time as programmed in the Capital Improvements Program, or shall be provided by the developer in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance to adequately service the type of subdivision and development being proposed. 2. Subdivision Improvements: When the construction or installation of street improvements, sidewalk improvements, public water supply, sanitary sewer systems, storm sewer systems or other drainage improvements, or other facilities is required to serve the proposed development within a subdivision, a prerequisite for the consideration of the Final Plat shall be the submission of a Benefit District Petition or a Subdivision Improvements Agreement specifically setting forth the extent, time schedule, and method of financing such construction or installation as proposed by the owner or developer. The Benefit District Petition or the Subdivision Improvements Agreement shall contain sufficient information to make a determination that the proposed construction or installation shall meet or exceed the standards set forth in the Subdivision Regulations herein. A phased construction time schedule may be recommended by the Planning Commission, subject to Governing Body approval, which is based on the owner's or developer's estimate of the pace at which development will proceed within the subdivision.
3. On-Site Systems: When on-site sewerage and/or water systems are proposed to be used in a County subdivision, a prerequisite for the approval of a Final Plat shall be a plan of such systems bearing the signed approval by the Director of the County Health Department. The approved plan for the on-site system shall be presented to the City along with the submission of the Final Plat. 4. Central Systems: When a central sewerage and/or water system is proposed for immediate or future use to serve all units within a County subdivision, a prerequisite for the approval of a Final Plat shall be an engineering report and a plant approved by the Director of the County Health Department. Such approved plan shall be presented to the City along with the submission of the Final Plat. In addition to the preparation and approval of such plans, the owner may file a formal written application with the County Commissioners for establishment of a County Sanitary Sewer and/or Water District to serve the subdivision. Such application, or "petition", shall be presented to the County Commissioners prior to the submission of the Final Plat to the City. A preliminary plan for the development and maintenance of such sewerage and/or water systems by either the owner or a Benefit District shall be prepared by the owner and presented to the City along with the Preliminary Plat. 5. Final Approval: Any approval required under this section does not obligate the Planning Commission to approve the proposed plat if the Planning Commission finds the overall development to be inconsistent with any established policies and plans. 5-105 Relocation of Existing Facilities: 1. Financial Obligations: Whenever any existing improvements and/or utilities are required to be relocated or upgraded due to the subdivision or construction of improvements required as a condition for approval of the subdivision plat, and in the event such was not known at the time of initial construction, the costs of such relocation or upgrading shall be the sole responsibility of the new subdivision. Franchise agreements between the City and private utilities in effect at the time of construction, may dictate the responsibility for absorbing costs associated with relocating or repairing utility lines. Responsibility may also depend on whether the relocation or repair is a private or public benefit. 2. Duplication of Improvements: Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any or all required improvements as set out above, and where such improvements meet the requirements of this Ordinance and are in good condition as determined by the City Engineer, no further provision need be made by the developer to duplicate such improvements. The developer shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of improvements so that all improvements will then meet the said requirements. 3. Street Widening or Reduction: Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or containing any existing public street or less than the minimum required right-of-way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated so as to provide a minimum street right-of-way width established by this Ordinance and/or City policy. The developer of such proposed subdivision shall provide an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards set by this Ordinance and the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall determine what adjustment to make where the widenings merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The City Engineer may approve reduction of the minimum roadway width, as required by this Ordinance, to match an existing roadway system where physical consideration warrants such action. 5-106 Acceptance: No improvements may be accepted until the City Engineer has inspected said improvements and certified that they meet the applicable standards.
5-107 Building Permits:
No building permits may be granted until the proposed subdivision has been approved and
recorded.
5-108 Off-Site Improvements:
The Planning Commission may, upon advice and findings, require the developer to submit a
Subdivision Improvements Agreement or a Benefit District Petition, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article, for the installation or upgrading of off-site improvements if such need is
substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Off-site improvements should be within
dedicated easements or rights-of-way and serve a public purpose. The financing of such
improvements shall be handled as if they were on-site improvements. The Governing Body may
require such subdivision to participate in the following facilities and improvements, or any other
off-site improvements as recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a
proposed subdivision:
1. Special grading requirements;
2. Street improvements;
3. Drainage improvements;
4. Traffic control devices;
5. Landscaping.
