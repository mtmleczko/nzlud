PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Cartersville, Georgia of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through February, 1986, and ordinances adopted by the city council and the 1990 Code and ordinances adopted by the city council through Ord. No. 51-09, adopted December 17, 2009. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 1 is 1-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-2 and 1-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-2.1, 1-2.2 and 1-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 9 and 10, it will be designated as Chapter 9.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Connie Keeling, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(1)  To receive and administer gifts, grants and donations and to administer trusts;

(5)  To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in the City of Cartersville and within a radius of five (5) miles as measured from the center of said city so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within aforesaid territorial limits suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant, or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant lands and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishings, machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
(6)  No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the authority but shall be leased or sold to one (1) or more persons, firms or corporations.

L. 1937, p. 761) as amended, Ga. Code Ann. Supp. Chapter 87-8 [now O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.], as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal of the authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the authority. The authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued.

M.  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor and the first members of the authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation. 
N.

The governing authority of the City of Cartersville, or the person designated by the said governing authority, shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose.

Also, the collector is not required to provide any certification or other documentation to the donor proving the collector's training in the collection process. 
Note: Although not required, it would benefit the collector to have the agency representative's name and telephone number to call if an unusual situation arises during the collection process. 
Chapter 2-Collection site: A collection site is a facility (permanent or temporary) where a donor provides a specimen for a drug test. 
A collection site must have: 
(1)  A restroom/stall with a toilet for the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen. The presence of a toilet is not absolutely necessary when a single-use collection container is used that has sufficient capacity to contain the entire void. Whenever available, a single toilet restroom is preferred. All types of restrooms including a mobile facility (e.g., a vehicle with an enclosed toilet) are acceptable. 
(2)  A source of water for washing hands that, if practical, is external to the restroom/stall where urination occurs. If a water source is not available, providing a moist towelette outside the restroom/stall is an acceptable alternative. 
(3)  A suitable clean surface for the collector to use as a work area. 
Note: The collector's work area must be located outside the restroom. However, if there is no appropriate space available outside the restroom to serve as a secure, clean work area and the restroom is large enough to accommodate a work area, the work area may be located inside the restroom as long as the donor has privacy while providing a urine specimen and the collector is the same gender as the donor. 
(4)  Security features to prevent unauthorized access to the site during the collection. 
(5)  Features to prevent the donor or anyone else from gaining unauthorized access to the collection materials/supplies. The collector must ensure that the donor does not have access to items that could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen (e.g., soap, disinfectants, cleaning agents, water). 
(6)  Features to provide for the secure handling/storage of specimens from collection until shipment. 
Chapter 3-Collection supplies: The following items must be available at the collection site to conduct proper collections: 
(1)  Single-use plastic collection containers. Each collection container must be individually sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to easily catch and hold at least fifty-five (55) ml. urine, and have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of forty-five (45) ml. and above. 
(2)  Single-use plastic specimen bottles. Each specimen bottle with cap must be sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to hold at least thirty-five (35) ml. (or they may be two (2) distinct sizes of specimen bottles providing that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least thirty-five (35) ml. of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least twenty (20) ml.), have screw-on or snap-on caps that prevent leakage, have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels (thirty (30) ml. for the primary specimen and fifteen (15) ml. for the split specimen) of urine to be poured into each bottle, be designed so that the required tamper-evident bottle label/seal on the CCF fits with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with chance that seal overlap would conceal printed information, and be leak resistant. 
Note: Two (2) specimen bottles with caps may be sealed together using a single tamper-evident system (such as, shrink wrap) because two (2) specimen bottles are always needed for split specimen collections. 
(3)  [Temperature strips.] Temperature strips capable of indicating temperature readings between 90E-100EF (or 32E-38EC). The temperature strips may either be affixed to the collection container as supplied or be affixed to the collection container after the donor gives the specimen collection container to the collector. 
(4)  [Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms.] Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms (CCF) approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
(5)  Tamper-evident seals. Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). If this occurs, the collector should have a separate tamper-evident label/seal that can be used to seal the specimen bottle. 
(6)  Leak-resistant plastic bags. The plastic bag must have two (2) sealable compartments or pouches (i.e., one (1) large enough to hold two (2) specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF). 
(7)  Absorbent material. The absorbent material is placed with the specimen bottles inside the leak-resistant plastic bag in case a specimen bottle leaks during shipment. 
Note: The use of absorbent material is required by the U.S. Postal Service and other express carriers when shipping biological materials. 
(8)  Shipping containers. Boxes or bags that are used to transport specimens to the laboratory and can be securely sealed to prevent the possibility of undetected tampering. A shipping container/mailer is not necessary if a laboratory courier hand-delivers the sealed leak-resistant plastic bags containing the specimen bottles directly from the collection site to the laboratory. 
(9)  Bluing agent. The bluing agent is added to the toilet bowl/water tank to prevent a donor from diluting the specimen. 
(10)  Secure temporary location. If the sealed leak-resistant plastic bag containing the specimen bottles is not immediately placed in a shipping container, the sealed plastic bag must always be maintained within the line of sight of the collector to ensure that no one has access to the specimen until it is placed in a shipping container or it must be placed in a secured temporary location (e.g., inside a refrigerator that can be secured, inside a cabinet that can be secured). If the collector always places the sealed plastic bags immediately into shipping containers, there is no need to have a secure temporary location available at the collection site. 
(11)  Disposable gloves. HHS recommends that collectors use single use disposable gloves while handling specimens. The occupational safety and health administration has specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who are exposed to potentially infectious body fluids (29 CFR Part 1910.1030). 
Chapter 4-Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form All urine specimens must be collected using chain of custody. Chain of custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling and storage of a specimen from the time a donor gives the specimen to the collector to the final disposition of the specimen. For specimens collected under the Mandatory Guidelines, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection site. The CCF is available from a number of different sources (e.g., laboratories, collectors, MROs) although it is usually provided by the laboratory. 
A sample of the CCF (OMB No. 0930-0158, Exp. Date: 6/30/2003) is on the SAMHSA web site (www.health.org/workpl.htm). All discussions throughout this revised handbook refer to this version of the CCF form. 
The CCF consists of the following five (5) copies: 
Copy 1. Laboratory copy. 
Copy 2. Medical review officer copy. 
Copy 3. Collector copy. 
Copy 4. Employer copy. 
Copy 5. Donor copy. 
Copy 1 accompanies the specimen to the testing laboratory, Copy 2 is sent to the MRO, Copy 3 is retained by the collector, Copy 4 is sent to the employer, and Copy 5 is given to the donor. 
The CCF is completed as follows: 
Step 1 - This step is completed by the collector or employer representative. The employer name and address and the MRO name and address may be preprinted or handwritten. The collector will normally enter the donor's social security number after verifying the donor's identity. The collector also marks the appropriate box to indicate the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters information required for the collection site. 
Step 2 - This step is completed by the collector after receiving the specimen from the donor and measuring the temperature of the specimen. This step requires the collector to mark the appropriate box to indicate if the temperature of the specimen was within the required temperature range; but also requires the collector to indicate whether it is a split specimen or single specimen collection, to indicate if no specimen was collected and why, or to indicate if it was an observed collection and why. 
Step 3 - This step instructs the collector to seal the specimen bottle(s), have the donor initial the bottle seal(s), and then instruct the donor to complete step 5 on the MRO copy (Copy 2). 
Step 4 - This step initiated by the collector and then completed by the laboratory after the specimen is accessioned by the laboratory. This step requires the collector to only sign the form once to certify that the specimen was collected, labeled, sealed, and released for shipment to the laboratory in accordance with federal requirements. The collector is also required to note the time of the collection, the date of the collection, and the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen is released for shipment to the laboratory. 
Note: There is no requirement for couriers, express carriers, or postal service personnel to document chain of custody for the specimens during transit because they do not have access to the specimen(s) or the CCF. Chain of custody annotations resume when the shipping container/package is opened and an individual at the laboratory has access to the specimen bottle(s) and the CCF. 
At the laboratory, the accessioner is required to document the condition of the primary specimen bottle seal, sign the CCF, print his/her name, record the date the specimen was accessioned, and indicate to whom the specimen was released. The entry for the "Specimen Bottle(s) Released To" may include transfer to temporary storage or transfer to another individual. After this transfer, chain of custody of the specimen bottle(s) is documented by the laboratory on an internal chain of custody form. 
Step 5(a) - This step is completed by the laboratory to document the test results on the primary specimen. 
Step 5(b) - This step is completed by the laboratory to report the split specimen result if the split specimen is tested. 
The bottom area of Copy 1 is reserved for the tamper-evident specimen bottle seal(s). There must be two (2) labels (i.e., one (1) marked with the letter "A" to designate the primary specimen and the other marked with the letter "B" to designate the split specimen) to accommodate collecting split specimens and each must have the same preprinted specimen identification number that appears at the top of the CCF. Each label must also have a place for the collector to annotate the date of the collection and a place for the donor to initial each label after it is placed on the specimen bottle. If a single specimen collection procedure is used, the second label (i.e., the "B" label) is discarded by the collector. 
Chapter 5-Donor identification: The donor must provide appropriate identification to the collector upon arrival at the collection site. Acceptable forms of identification include: 
(1)  A photo identification (e.g., drivers license, employee badge). 
(2)  Identification by an agency representative; or 
(3)  Any other identification allowed under an agency's Workplace drug testing plan. 
Unacceptable forms of identification include: 
(1)  Identification by a co-worker; 
(2)  Identification by another donor; or 
(3)  Use of a single non-photo identification card (e.g., social security card, credit card, union or other membership cards, pay vouchers, voter registration card). 
Chapter 6-Collection procedure: The following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the Mandatory Guidelines: 
Step 
(1)  The collector prepares the collection site to collect urine specimens. All collection supplies must be available, the area properly secured, water sources secured, and bluing agent placed in all toilets. 
Note: If access to a water supply in the restroom cannot be controlled, the collector may tell the donor that he or she will be listening at the entrance to the restroom for any sounds associated with the donor attempting to use the available sources of water. Alternatively, the collector may enter the restroom with the donor if the collector is the same gender as the donor, but remains outside the toilet stall. 
(2)  The collector begins the collection without delay after the donor arrives at the collection site. 
Note: Do not wait because the donor is not ready, is unable to urinate, or an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
(3)  The collector requests the donor to present an acceptable form of identification as described in Chapter 5. 
Note: If the donor cannot satisfy the identification requirement, the collector may proceed with the collection if the donor can provide two (2) items of identification bearing his or her signature. After the donor signs the certification statement, the collector should compare the donor's signature with signatures on the identification that was presented. If the signatures match, the collector lists on the "Remarks" line the two (2) items of identification used to identify the donor and states that "signature identification was confirmed." The collector then continues with the collection process. If the signature does not match the signatures on the two (2) items of identification presented, the collector should state on the "Remarks" line that "signature identification is unconfirmed," discontinue the collection, and notify the collection site supervisor and the agency. 
Note: In situations where the donor does not have either photo identification or two (2) other appropriate items of identification that could be used to verify identity and signature, this should not be automatically considered refusal to test. The collector should proceed with the collection. The collector should provide sufficient information on the "Remarks" line to help the MRO and the agency make a determination regarding the validity of the specimen and the collection process. 
Note: If the donor asks the collector to provide identification, the collector must show the donor some form of identification. It must include the collector's name and the employer's name, address, and telephone number. It does not have to be a picture identification or include a home address and telephone number. 
(4)  The collector reviews the instructions on the back of the CCF with the donor. 
(5)  The collector begins entering information and/or ensures that the required information is provided at the top of the CCF (the laboratory name and address and a pre-printed specimen ID number) and in Step 1 of the CCF (employer's name, address, and I.D. number (if applicable), MRO name, address, phone and fax number, donor SSN or employee ID number, reason for test, drug test to be performed, collection site information). 
Note: A specific MRO's name and address must appear on the form rather than the name of the clinic or medical facility. 
(6)  The collector asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer clothing (e.g., coat, jacket, hat, etc.) and to leave any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings he or she is carrying with the outer clothing. The donor may retain his or her wallet. 
Note: The donor must not be asked to remove other articles of clothing, such as, shirts, pants, dresses, or under garments. Additionally, the donor must not be requested or required to remove all clothing and wear a hospital or examination gown. 
(7)  The collector directs the donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items to ensure that no items are present that could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the donor places the items back into the pockets and the collection procedure continues. 
Note: If an item is found that appears to have been brought to the collection site with the intent to adulterate the specimen, a direct observed collection procedure is used. If the item appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site, secure the item and continue with the normal collection procedure. 
(8)  The collector instructs the donor to wash and dry his or her hands, preferably under the collector's observation and must not wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to the collector. 
Note: The donor must not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate/dilute the specimen. 
(9)  The collector either gives the donor or allows the donor to select the collection container from the available supply. Either the collector or the donor, with both present, then unwraps or breaks the seal of the collection container. 
Note: Do not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time. 
Note: Do not allow the donor to take anything except the collection container into the room used for urination. 
(10)  The collector directs the donor to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least forty-five (45) ml. (split specimen collection) or thirty (30) ml. (single specimen collection), not to flush the toilet, and return with the specimen as soon as possible after completing the void. 
Note: The donor is always permitted to provide a specimen in private unless a direct observed collection has been authorized. 
Note: Pay close attention to the donor during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to substitute or adulterate a specimen. If you detect such conduct, immediately begin a new direct observed collection using a second CCF. Provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the first CCF and submit it along with the specimen to the laboratory for testing. This will ensure that the laboratory knows that two (2) separate specimens are being submitted for testing; the first one (1) possibly being adulterated or substituted. Additionally, inform a supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so. 
(11)  After the donor hands the specimen to the collector, the collector must measure the temperature of the specimen, check the specimen volume, and inspect the specimen for adulteration or substitution. 
Temperature. Check the temperature of the specimen within four (4) minutes after the donor hands you the specimen. The acceptable temperature range is 32E-38EC/90E-100EF. Temperature is determined by reading the temperature strip originally affixed to or placed on the outside of the collection container after the donor hands you the specimen. 
1.  If the temperature is within the acceptable range, the "Yes" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector proceeds with the collection procedure. 
2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, the "No" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector immediately begins a direct observed collection procedure using a second CCF. The original specimen is sealed and sent with the first CCF to the laboratory with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line to indicate that a direct observed specimen was also being collected and submitted to the laboratory. 
Specimen volume. Check to make sure that the specimen contains a sufficient amount of urine (i.e., thirty (30) mL for a single specimen collection, forty-five (45) mL for a split specimen collection). 
A.  Single specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable range. 
1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the same CCF for the second specimen, but must use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken. 
2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken. 
Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
B.  Split specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range. 
1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the original CCF for the second specimen, but should use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen collection with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF. 
2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under the direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. 
If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume collected) with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF. 
Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
C.  Split specimen collection. If the volume is between thirty (30) and forty-five (45) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range. 
1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, all of the urine should be poured into one (1) specimen bottle (Bottle A). Bottle A is sent to the laboratory along with the CCF. The collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of a split specimen collection procedure. 
2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. 
If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second collection, the second specimen is submitted as a single specimen collection and the collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of split specimen collection procedure. 
Note: HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
Adulteration or substitution. Inspect the specimen for unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material, or other signs of adulteration (e.g., if you notice any unusual odor). If it is apparent from this inspection that the donor has adulterated or substituted the specimen (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach), a second collection using direct observation procedures is conducted. The first specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation are both sent to the laboratory for testing. The first specimen is always sent to the laboratory even though it may have had an insufficient volume for either a single or split specimen collection. 
If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs. 
Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
Note: Under no circumstances is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids. 
(12)  The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle. 
Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected. 
Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid. 
(13)  The collector pours the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle label/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal. 
Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s). 
(14)  The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). 
Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the CCF label/seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle; however, a label/seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after several minutes the label/seal begins to lift off along the edges). The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
Note: If while sealing and initialing the CCF label/seal the collector or donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the collector must apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor. The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
Note: Since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamper-evident tape and does not have to be under the donor's direct observation, the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so. 
(15)  The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers. 
Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect. Otherwise, without the collector's comment, a CCF without the donor's signature could result in a canceled test. The same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the label(s). 
(16)  The collector completes the chain of custody on the CCF (Step 4) by printing his or her name, signing where indicated, recording the date and time of the collection, and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottle(s) are being released. 
(17)  The collector removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the donor. The donor may now leave the collection site. 
Note: At this time, the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and over-the-counter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy (Copy 5) of the CCF, but not on any other copy. This information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the MRO. 
(18)  The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal. 
(19)  The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate. 
Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container. The collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container. 
Note: The collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible, the same day preferably. 
(20)  The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector. 
The collection procedure is now complete. 
Chapter 7-Shy Bladder Procedure: When a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen, the donor may have intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site, could not provide a specimen as directed by the collector, has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a specimen, or has a "shy bladder." The term "shy bladder" usually refers to an individual who is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby during the attempted urination. 
If a donor tells the collector, upon arrival at the collection site, that he or she cannot provide a specimen, the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless of the reason given. 
At the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor unwrap/open a collection container, the does the following: 
(1)  Requests the donor to try to provide a specimen. 
Note: The donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container. 
(2)  Directs the donor to drink some fluids. 
Note: The donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
Note: The donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process. 
Note: If the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine specimen, the collection procedure is discontinued and a "refusal to test" is noted on the "Remarks" line of the CCF. 
(3)  Instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen. The collector uses the CCF from the first attempt. 
Note: It is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one (1) additional attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts. 
(4)  Maintains a record of the time of each attempt, whether there was no specimen provided or the quantity of specimen provided, and the total ounces of fluid given to the donor. 
(5)  Discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was used for the void, but retains the CCF. 
Note: If there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt, the collection container may be used for the next attempt. 
(6)  Discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a potential "shy bladder" situation if after a period of three (3) hours (i.e., from the time the donor first demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen) the donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen. 
(7)  Indicates "Shy Bladder" on the "Remarks" line of the CCF and attaches a copy of the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen. Copy 1 is discarded since no valid specimen was collected and the other copies of the CCF are distributed as appropriate. 
If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs. 
Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
Note: Under no circumstance is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids. 
(8)  The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle. 
Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected. 
Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid. 
(9)  The collector pours the specimen from the collection/container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal. 
Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s). 
(10)  The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). 
Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the CCF label/seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle; however, a label/seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after several minutes the label/seal begins to lift off along the edges). The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
Note: If while sealing and initialing the CCF label/seal the collector or donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the collector must apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor. The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
Note: Since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamper-evident tape and does not have to be under the donor's direct observation, the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so. 
(11)  The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers. 
Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect. Otherwise, without the collector's comment, a CCF without the donor's signature could result in a canceled test. The same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the label(s). 
(12)  The collector completes the chain of custody on the CCF form (Step 4) by printing his or her name, signing where indicated, recording the date and time of the collection, and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottle(s) are being released. 
(13)  The collector removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the donor. The donor may now leave the collection site. 
Note: At this time, the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and over-the-counter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy (Copy 5) of the CCF, but not on any other copy. This information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the MRO. 
(14)  The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal. 
(15)  The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate. 
Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container. The collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container. 
Note: The collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible, the same day preferably. 
(16)  The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector. 
The collection procedure is now complete. 
Chapter 8-Direct Observed Collection: A direct observed collection procedure is the same as a routine collection procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor urinate into the collection container. 
The use of an observer may occur only when: 
(1)  A previous drug test was reported either positive for a drug, dilute, adulterated, substituted, unsuitable for testing, or canceled because the split specimen was not tested; 
(2)  The drug test is a return-to-duty or a follow-up test; 
(3)  The agency/employer believes that the donor may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided; or 
(4)  During a routine collection, the temperature of the specimen collected is outside the acceptable range, the collector observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct indicated a possible attempt to adulterate or substitute a specimen, or the collector believes that the specimen has been adulterated (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach). 
Note: The observer must be the same gender as the donor even if the observer has a medical background/training. 
The collector may serve as the observer when the collector is the same gender as the donor. If not, the collector must call upon another individual (who is the same gender as the donor) to act as the observer. 
Note: With regard to chain of custody, the observer must never touch/handle the collection container. 
After the donor has completed urinating into the collection container, the donor and observer leave the enclosed toilet stall/restroom and the donor hands the collection container directly to the collector. 
Note: The observer must maintain visual contact of the collection container until the donor hands the container to the collector. 
Note: If the observer and collector are one (1) and the same, the collector may receive the collection container from the donor while they are both in the enclosed toilet stall/restroom. 
The collector continues with the collection procedure, checks the box for an observed collection in Step 2 on the CCF, and provides the name of the observer and the reason for an observed collection on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the CCF. A separate sheet explaining the use of an observed collection may be attached to the CCF if there is insufficient room on the "Remarks" line. 
Chapter 9-Blind samples: Each federal agency is required to have some blind samples (negative and positive spiked samples) submitted along with the donor specimens. 
The blind samples are either purchased by the agency and given to the collector or the collector, third party administrator, or MRO purchases the blind samples from a supplier and submits the blind samples along with agency's donor specimens. 
A blind sample is always submitted using the same CCF as that used for a donor specimen. The collector provides the required information to ensure that the CCF has been properly completed as well as providing fictitious initials on the specimen bottle label/seal. Since there is no donor, the collector must indicate that the sample is a "blind sample" on the MRO copy where the donor would normally provide a signature (Step 5 on Copy 2 of the CCF). 
Note: For a blind sample, Copy 5 of the CCF (the donor copy) may be discarded by the collector. 
Note: If a federal agency/employer collects "split specimens" for its workplace drug testing program, the blind samples must also be submitted as "split specimens". 
Chapter 10-Documentation errors/fatal flaws: When an HHS certified laboratory receives a specimen bottle(s) and its associated CCF, it checks to see if the specimen ID number on the specimen bottle label/seal matches the number on the CCF, that the specimen bottle seal is intact, and that the CCF has been properly completed by the collector. If there is any discrepancy and/or error of omission (e.g., the collector did not sign the chain of custody, the collector did not check one (1) of the specimen temperature boxes), the laboratory will contact the collector to determine if the discrepancy and/or missing information can be recovered. That is, the collector can provide a written memorandum attesting to the fact that he or she did actually carry out the required action but inadvertently forget to properly document the CCF. 
Note: If a memorandum cannot be provided by the collector to recover the discrepancy or error of omission, the laboratory will report "Rejected for Testing" to the MRO and provide an appropriate comment as to why the specimen was not tested. 
Note: Once contacted by the laboratory, the collector should immediately respond to the laboratory indicating whether it can or cannot provide a memorandum to recover the discrepancy and/or error of omission. HHS recommends that laboratories retain these specimens for a minimum of five (5) business days before they may be discarded. 
Chapter 11-Regulated and non-regulated employers: Federal agencies and employers regulated by the department of transportation (DOT) are required to use the OMB approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form for their workplace drug testing programs. All other employers, private sector companies, states, department of justice programs, and the non-DOT testing conducted by DOT regulated employers are considered "non-regulated" with respect to complying with the HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs or the DOT Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs and are prohibited from using the Federal CCF. 
In the rare instance where the collector, either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (e.g., post-accident test with insufficient time to obtain the CCF), uses a non-federal form for a regulated collection, the use of a non-federal form does, in and of itself, present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for the MRO to cancel the test. However, if the laboratory or the MRO discovers the use of the incorrect form, a signed statement must be obtained from the collector stating the reason why the Federal CCF was not used for the regulated collection.

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Div. 2, §§ 2-181-2-193, and enacted a new Div. 2 as set out herein. The former Div. 2 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 4(Exh. D), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, §§ 4, 5, 9-6-01. 
The effective date of this division is October 2005. 

Sec. 2-181. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this procedure is to reduce accidents that may result from the misuse of alcohol, thereby reducing fatalities, injuries, and property damage; and to comply with the alcohol testing standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-182. - Definitions. 
    Accident means an incident reportable under 49 CFR Part 191 involving gas pipeline facilities, which includes all parts of those physical facilities through which gas moves in transportation, including but not limited to pipe, valves, and other appurtenances attached to pipe, compressor units, metering stations, regulator stations, delivery stations, holders, and fabricated assemblies. 
An incident on a gas pipeline is defined as follows; 
(a)  An event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline and: 
1.  A death or personal injury necessitating inpatient hospitalization; or 
2.  Estimated property damage, including cost of gas lost, to the operator or others, or both of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or more. 
(b)  An event that is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though it did not meet the criteria set forth above.

    Confirmation test means a second test, following a screening test with a result of 0.02 or greater that provides quantitative data of alcohol concentration. 
    Covered employee means a person who is an employee of the system, or who is an employee of a contractor engaged by the system and who performs work on a pipeline or an operation maintenance, or emergency-response function regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, as provided in 49 CFR Parts 192, 193, and 195. 
    Covered function (safety-sensitive function) means an operation, maintenance, or emergency-response function that is performed on a pipeline and is regulated by 49 CFR Parts 191 and 192. 
    Performing (a covered function) means an employee is considered to be performing a covered function (safety-sensitive function) during any period in which he or she is actually performing, is ready to perform, or is immediately available to perform such covered functions. 
    Refusal to submit (to an alcohol test) mean that a covered employee fails to provide an adequate breathing for testing without a valid medical explanation after receiving notice of the requirements to be tested or engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process. 
    Safety director means the employee appointed by the city manager to oversee all functions of the Alcohol and Drug Programs of the City of Cartersville. 
    Screening test (or initial test) means an analytic procedure to determine whether an employee may have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in a breath specimen.

(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-183. - How to get help. 
    If you have any problem related to alcohol use or you suspect that a fellow employee has such a problem, notify your supervisor or the alcohol program manager, whose name is listed in Appendix A of this procedure. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-184. - Who must be tested. 
    As of January 1, 1996 any employee who would perform an operating, maintenance, or emergency response function on a pipeline is subject to alcohol testing under federal regulations. The persons holding any position listed in Appendix A of this procedure are considered covered employees and are subject to alcohol testing. An employee who prior to notification of testing for alcohol misuse that has notified his supervisor that he has an alcohol problem will not be allowed to perform the duties of a covered employee. The system at its discretion may send the employee to a substance abuse professional. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-185. - When testing must occur. 
(a)  Alcohol testing must be performed on four (4) occasions: 
(1)  When there has been an accident (post-accident testing). 
(2)  When there is reasonable suspicion that one (1) or more alcohol-affected employees may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. (reasonable-suspicion testing). 
(3)  When an employee returns to duty after engaging in prohibited conduct (return-to-duty testing). 
(4)  Following the return to work of a covered employee who has received assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse (follow-up testing). The covered employee will be subject to a reasonable program of following-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return to duty. 
(b)  The requirements for each type of testing are as follows: 
(1)  Post-accident testing. 
a.  Following an accident, as defined in the definition section of this procedure, the system will promptly test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance contributed to the accident. 
b.  The decision not to administer an alcohol test under this section will be based on the system's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. 
c.  Each employee involved is required to submit to an alcohol test within two (2) hours of the accident. If a test is not administered within eight (8) hours following the accident, the system will stop trying to conduct an alcohol test and will prepare and keep on file a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted. 
d.  An employee who is subject to post-accident testing and who fails to remain readily available for such testing-Including notifying his supervisor of his/her location if he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to an alcohol test-May be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
e.  The employee must remain available for alcohol testing and may not consume any alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until the alcohol test has been conducted. Employees should, however, seek and obtain emergency medical care whenever necessary. 
(1)  Reasonable-suspicion testing. 
a.  Reasonable-suspicion testing is designed (in conjunction with supervisor training on the signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse) to identify alcohol-affected employees who may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. Employees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their safety or productivity. Supervisors will make a decision as to whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is using or has used alcohol. 
b.  A determination by the system that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists and to require a covered employee to undergo an alcohol test will be based on specific, stated observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee at the time. The required observations will be made by a supervisor who has received at least sixty (60) minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse and will be documented. 
c.  If a reasonable-suspicion test is not administered within two (2) hours following the determination, the System will prepare and keep on file a record stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered. If the required test is not administered within eight (8) hours of the determination, the system will stop trying to administer an alcohol test and will state in the record the reason for not administering the test. Upon request such records will be made available to any person who has been delegated authority in the matter concerned. 
d.  The system will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse. 
(3)  Return-to-duty testing. 
a.  If a substance abuse professional consulted in the case makes a determination that some form of evaluation and/or treatment is required, then the employee must comply with the recommended provisions in order to be considered eligible to return-to-duty. 
b.  Before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct, the system will ensure that the employee undergoes a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. 
(4)  Follow-up testing. 
a.  Following the determination that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, the employee will be subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An employee who returns to duty will be subject to a reasonable program of follow-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return-to-duty. 
b.  The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced alcohol follow-up tests during the first twelve (12) months following his or her return to duty. The SAP assigned may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing any time after the initial six (6) tests have been completed if the SAP makes the determination that such testing is no longer warranted. 
c.  The system may require a covered employee to submit to alcohol follow-up testing when the SAP assigned has reason to suspect alcohol involvement. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-186. - Prohibited alcohol-related conduct. 
    The use or possession of alcoholic beverage(s) while on the system, or in any system vehicle, or on system time, including breaks or lunches, paid or unpaid, on any shift, is strictly prohibited. 
(1)  Alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. Covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) greater (which means 0.04 grams or more of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath). If the system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions. 
(2)  Pre-duty use within four (4) hours. Covered employees may not use alcohol within four (4) hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four (4) hours to performing covered functions or within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions. 
(3)  On-duty use. Covered employees shall not use alcohol while performing covered functions. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered functions, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-187. - Penalty for not submitting to an alcohol test. 
    Any employee who refused to submit to a post-accident, reasonable-suspicion, or follow-up alcohol test shall not be permitted to perform covered functions or continue to perform covered functions and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-188. - Disciplinary actions for alcohol misuse. 
(a)  A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater will be terminated. A covered employee who has violated the prohibitions on alcohol misuse and has been terminated will not be reconsidered for re-employment by the system for a period of one (1) year. 
(b)  A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration greater that two hundredths (0.02) but less than four hundredths (0.04) will not be permitted to perform covered functions or continue to perform covered functions until: 
(1)  An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than two hundredths (0.02); or 
(2)  The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but no less than eight (8) hours following the determination that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions as contained in this procedure. 
(c)  An employee who refuses to submit to an alcohol test without valid medical explanation after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance with the requirements of this procedure, or who engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing procedure, will be terminated from employment. 
(d)  On duty or possession of alcohol on the systems time or premises will result in termination of employment. 
(e)  When an employee has tested for alcohol in a concentration of two hundredths (0.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (0.04), that employee will be removed from performing any covered function and suspended without pay for the remainder of his or her shift. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-189. - Review and appeal. 
    Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have a chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-190. - Where alcohol tests will be performed. 
    All alcohol testing for the system will be performed by the entity designated in appendix A of the procedure. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-191. - Rules of the disclosure of alcohol information and records. 
(a)  The system will maintain all alcohol-related testing information, including all tests results and other appropriate records, in a secure manner to prevent the disclosure of such information to unauthorized personnel. 
(b)  The person assigned to manage the alcohol testing program for the system will maintain a locked file containing all the alcohol testing information and records. This file will be maintained as confidential. Employees files will be handled on a strict "need to know" basis. 
(c)  Alcohol test results will not be included in personnel files. 
(d)  The system will not release information on covered employees that is contained in records as required to be maintained by this procedure and in accordance with federal requirements except as required by law or when expressly authorized or required by 49 CFR Parts 199 and 40. 
(e)  A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to alcohol tests. The system will promptly provide the requested records. Access to an employee's records will not be contingent upon payment for records other than those specifically requested. 
(f)  The system will make records available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of the written request from any covered employee. Disclosure by the subsequent employer is permitted only as expressly authorized by the terms of the employee's written request. 
(g)  The system may disclose required information pertaining to a covered employee to the employee or the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual, and arising from the results of an alcohol test administered as required by this procedure and the regulations set forth in 49 CFR Parts 199 or 40 or from the system's determination that the covered employee engaged in prohibited alcohol-related conduct including but not limited to, a worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding relating to a benefit sought by the employee. 
(h)  The system will release information regarding covered employee's record as directed by the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information to an identified person. Release of such information by the person receiving the information will be only in accordance with the terms of the employee's consent. 
(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-192. - Required record keeping. 
    The person assigned to manage the system's alcohol-testing program will maintain the alcohol testing records in accordance with the provision set out in this procedure.

(Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-193. - Alcohol testing. 
Subpart L-Alcohol screening tests. 
§ 40.241. What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test? 
    As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using: 
a)  When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test. 
b)  Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
1.  If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins. 
2.  If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test. 
c)  Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee. 
d)  If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number. 
e)  Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF. 
f)  Complete Step 1 of the ATF. 
g)  Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. 
Subpart L-Alcohol screening tests. 
§ 40.25. What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD? 
a)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD: 
1.  Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date. 
2.  Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee. 
3.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer. 
4.  If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test. 
5.  When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated. 
6.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device. 
(ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test. 
(iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
(iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
(v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
(vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test. 
7.  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)-(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test. 
8.  You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF. 
9.  You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing. 
10.  You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF. 
(b)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the breath tube ASD: 
1.  Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You must not use the device after its expiration date. 
2.  Remove a device from the package and break the tube's ampule in the presence of the employee. 
3.  Secure an inflation bag onto the appropriate end of the device, as directed by the manufacturer on the device's instructions. 
4.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee chooses to use (e.g., hold) the device, instruct the employee to blow forcefully and steadily into the blowing end of device until the inflation bag fills with air (approximately twelve (12) seconds). 
5.  If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
6.  When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear. 
7.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one. 
(ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test. 
(iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
(iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
(v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
(vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using another type of ASD (e.g., saliva device) or an EBT. 
8.  If you were able to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section, you must compare the color of the crystals in the device with the colored crystals on the manufacturer-produced control tube no sooner than the manufacturer instructs. In all cases color comparisons must take place within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. 
9.  You must follow the manufacturer's instructions for determining the result of the test. You must then show both the device and the control tube side-by-side to the employee and record the result on the ATF. 
10.  You must never re-use devices or gloves used in breath tube testing. The inflation bag must be voided of air following removal from a device. One (1) inflation bag can be used for up to ten (10) breath tube tests. 
11.  You must note the fact that you used a breath tube device in Step 3 of the ATF. {67 FR 61522, Oct. 1, 2002}

Secs. 2-194-2-210. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Art. VII, §§ 2-211-2-219, and enacted a new Art. VII as set out herein. The former Art. VII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 2(Exh. B), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, §§ 6, 7, 9, 11, 9-6-01. 
The effective date of this article is October, 2005. 

Sec. 2-211. - Purpose. 
    The City of Cartersville has a public trust to provide a variety of services to the community. An efficient and productive work force is vital to carry out that trust. The public has a reasonable right to expect persons employed by the city to perform their duties free from the effects of drugs, including alcohol. 
    The city has an obligation to ensure public safety through the actions of its employees. Furthermore, employees of the city have a reasonable right to work in a safe environment free from the effects of drug use. The city has a reasonable right to expect employees to report for work fit for duty, free from the effects of drug use. 
    The city recognizes that an employee's physical condition affects job performance, and that drug abuse ranks as one (1) of the major health problems in our society. It is the intent of this policy to express the city's viewpoint on drug usage exhibited by behavioral and medical disorders, to encourage an enlightened viewpoint toward these disorders, and to provide guidelines for consistent handling of situations arising from such disorders. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-212. - Definitions. 
    As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates that different meaning is intended. 
    City: The City of Cartersville, Georgia, a municipal corporation of the State of Georgia. 
    Controlled substance: Any of those substances listed under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the State of Georgia. 
    Designated positions: Those positions listed on Exhibit A at the end of this section and by this reference made a part hereof. 
    Drug and alcohol testing: May include, but not limited to, urinalysis, breath-analysis, oral fluids, hair testing or blood sample testing. 
    Illegal drugs: Drugs for which possession, use, sale or distribution is unlawful pursuant to the laws of the State of Georgia or any federal law or regulation. Illegal drugs, for the purpose of this policy, include drugs, which are not legally obtainable, and drugs, which are legally obtainable but have been obtained illegally. 
    Intoxicating substance: Any substance which produces changes on one's physical, mental, or emotional state or behavior, including but not limited to glue, paint thinner, etc. 
    Possession: Having controlled substances which are not obtained either directly from a doctor or pharmacist using a valid prescription, or having controlled substances, the possession or use of which is unlawful pursuant to the laws of the State of Georgia or any federal law or regulation. 
    Reportable incident: Any personal injury or property damage involving a city employee that occurs on or off city property during assigned work hours, or any time an employee is using a city vehicle or wearing a city uniform. 
    Safety director: The employee appointed by the city manager to oversee all functions of the alcohol and drug programs of the City of Cartersville. 
    Under the influence of alcohol: Means that as a result of the consumption of alcohol an employee (or applicant's) ability to perform his or her job is impaired to any appreciable degree. For the purposes of this definition, a blood alcohol level of .08 percent alcohol in the blood by weight shall be considered to be sufficient to establish an employee is under the influence. However, an employee with a blood alcohol level of less than .08 percent alcohol in the blood by weight may also be considered under the influence of alcohol if job performance is impaired to any appreciable degree. 
    Under the influence of drugs or other intoxicating substances: Means that as a result of the consumption, inhalation or injection or any combination of alcohol, drug or any other intoxicating substance or any combination of substances, an employee's job performance is impaired to any appreciable degree. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-213. - Rules and regulations. 
    The City of Cartersville is concerned with those situations where use of alcohol, intoxicating substances, or other drugs is detrimental to the public trust or to the safety of employees or citizens. The city is committed to the rehabilitation of employees who abuse drugs and alcohol by referral. 
    Early recognition and treatment of chemical dependency problems is important for successful rehabilitation to improve job performance and reduce personal, family, and social disruption. Employees who participate in a program for the purpose of treating alcoholism or drug addiction may do so without jeopardizing their employment with the city, provided they stop all involvement with alcohol or other drugs. Participation in such programs will not automatically prevent disciplinary action for incidents that have already occurred. Should a rehabilitation program be necessary, leaves of absence must be used in accordance with current policies. 
    To implement this policy, the following rules are established as conditions of employment with the city. 
(1)  The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive on a detection test for illegal drugs or alcohol. Those individuals will be prohibited from employment with the city for one (1) year, unless they provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse rehabilitation program. Applicant who has completed a rehabilitation program will be subject to drug screening prior to being employed. 
(2)  Any city employee who is involved in a reportable incident (see definitions) that results in injury to persons or property shall be subject to an investigation. Employees will be directed to undergo a drug or alcohol detection test to aid in determining fitness for duty if there is reasonable suspicion that the employee was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident. An employee who refused to participate in a required drug or alcohol detection test will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(3)  Based on the results of the investigation and drug or alcohol detection testing, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with departmental or city guidelines, and established practices for various infractions. 
(4)  If enrollment in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program is required; employees will be referred to the city manager. An employee's fitness to continue in his or her current position while enrolled in such a rehabilitation program will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Employees who have completed a rehabilitation program will be subject to drug screening. 
(5)  Any city employee at any level who reports for work on city premises or work sites will be directed to undergo a drug or alcohol detection test to aid in determining fitness for duty if there is reasonable suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. An employee who refuses to participate in such testing will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
(6)  All illegal drugs (see definitions) discovered during an investigation will be given to the appropriate law enforcement agency and may result in criminal prosecution. Drug or alcohol test results will be used for administrative purposes only and will be kept confidential, unless subpoenaed because of legal action or otherwise required to be released pursuant to the laws, rules and regulations of the State of Georgia. 
(7)  The use, sale, possession, or distribution of a narcotic, an intoxicating substance or any illegal drug or alcohol while at work will subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(8)  Supervisors shall take appropriate action to protect city personnel and city property by removing from the work premises or site any individual not in condition to perform assigned work in a normal and safe manner. An employee who appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol shall be taken to an authorized facility for drug and alcohol testing. Employees shall not be allowed to drive any vehicle if it appears that they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
(9)  If any employee has reasonable suspicion that a supervisor is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, his observations shall be reported to the supervisor's immediate superior. If the employee feels that reporting these observations in this manner would adversely affect his working conditions, the report may be made to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-214. - Exemption for prescribed medical treatment. 
    The use of legally controlled substances as part of a prescribed medical treatment by a licensed physician will not subject an employee to disciplinary action or denial of employment if that treatment does not adversely affect job performance. Prescribed use must be substantiated by a physician's report or statement. If the use of prescribed drugs adversely affects an employee's job performance or is detrimental to the public trust or safety of other employees or citizens, it is in the best interest of the employee and the city for the employee to be placed on a leave of absence. Leaves of absence will be used in accordance with current policies. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-215. - Screening process. 
    In keeping with the city's goal to establish and maintain a work environment free from the effects of drugs and intoxicating substances, and to insure the safety of citizens, the work place and the work force, the following procedures as established: 
(1)  For designated positions, applicants who have received an offer of employment must successfully complete a drug and alcohol detection test in addition to successful completion of any other physical examination requirements. A positive finding of alcohol or illegal drugs will result in denial of employment with the city. 
(2)  Applicants for designated positions who do not submit to screening at the appointed time will be denied employment. 
(3)  The safety director at the request of department heads, with input from the immediate supervisor, shall initiate drug or alcohol screening of employees involved in reportable incidents (see definitions) that result in injury to person or property, if there is reasonable suspicion of substance abuse. 
(4)  Drug or alcohol testing of employees may be initiated by department heads, when there is a reasonable suspicion that substance abuse is occurring. The safety director shall be consulted, if possible, before ordering a test. 
(5)  For purposes of drug or alcohol testing under subsections (3) and (4) above, a determination of reasonable suspicion that a person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol includes, but not limited to, any of the following criteria: 
An employee seems disoriented; confirmed reports from police, citizens or other employees of drug or alcohol use or abnormal, potentially dangerous behavior, medical or physical information such as track marks; absenteeism or tardiness; any articulate facts which lead supervisors or department heads to believe an employee is in possession of drugs or alcohol; or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; or the accumulation of facts that indicate an employee, because of alcohol or drug abuse, is unfit for duty. (The areas of observation listed in Exhibit B at the end of this article and by the reference made a part hereof, will be used as a guide for such determination.) 
Drug or alcohol screening of applicants or employees will include any approved DOT test method. The consent form to be used for each such test is Exhibit C at the end of this article and by this reference made a part hereof. Any positive readings following urine testing will be confirmed by an alternative testing method before any management action is taken. 
The tests designed to detect drugs most commonly abused. Listed below are nine (9) drug groups that are identified by the use of the test: 
Alcohol 
Amphetamines 
Barbiturates 
Cocaine/Metabolite 
Methaqualone 
Phencyclidine (PCP) 
Opiates 
Benzodiazepines 
Cannabinoides (THC) 
These drug groups were selected based on known abuse in the community and the ability of each drug to adversely affect physical and mental performance. As new or existing drugs develop into abuse problems, they shall be included in the screening when technically and financially feasible. All positive urine or blood samples will be retained by the laboratory for one (1) year, or longer if an appeal or court action is in process. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-216. - Review and appeal. 
    Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test conducted of the original sample at a laboratory of the employee's choice that has been pre-approved by the city. An employee or applicant shall request such re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have a chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance to the city manager for a hearing. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-217. - Implementation. 
(a)  Substance abuse screening will be conducted by certified technicians of breath alcohol testing devices or by the medical group or groups responsible for administering pre-employment physical examinations. The integrity of the urine or blood sample being tested or the breath test record card will be ensured by an explicit chain of custody procedures developed by the substance abuse mental health administration. Any testing, testing-related documents, and test results will be kept confidential and will only be released to the safety director or city manager. Further disclosures of such information is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or applicant. Any breach of confidentially will subject the employee responsible to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(b)  The safety director will assist supervisors in policy implementation, day-to-day administration, and with disciplinary action arising from implementation of the policy. 
(c)  A training program will be provided to assist supervisory personnel in identifying drug and alcohol use among employees. The training will be directed towards helping supervisors recognize the conduct and behavior that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use. 
(d)  The safety director will be responsible for scheduling the screening of applicants and employees during normal working hours. the safety director, personnel director, and assistant to the city manager will schedule screening during night shift working hours. 
(e)  This policy is intended to be a unilateral expression of the general policies, procedures and guidelines concerning substance abuse. It is not intended to create any contractual rights of employment, whether express or implied, between the city and its employees. The city reserves the right to change the provisions of this policy at any time. 
(Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-218. - Access to facilities and records. 
    The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including test records. In addition, federal, state, and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information as expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide information to employee or decision-maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example to workers' compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee. _____

ARTICLE VIII. - COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SAFETY SENSITIVE FUNCTION EMPLOYEES DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Art. VIII, §§ 2-231-2-244, and enacted a new Art. VIII as set out herein. The former Art. VIII pertained to alcohol and drug use by commercial drivers and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 3(Exh. C), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, § 8, 9-6-01. 

Sec. 2-231. - General policy. 
    Continued research and practical experience have established that even small quantities of alcohol and drugs can impair reflexes and judgment. This impairment, even when not readily apparent, can have catastrophic results, particularly for employees operating vehicles, potentially dangerous equipment, or using weapons. Unlawful drug use, including the abuse of prescription medication is also incompatible with the responsibility of City of Cartersville employees with commercial driver's license to obey the law, especially those employees who are involved in drug interdiction. To comply with the guidelines of the department of transportation in regard to operators of vehicles/equipment requiring commercial driver's licenses and other reasons, we have adopted a policy that all employees must report to work completely free from the presence of alcohol or unlawful drugs, or habit-forming drugs with whose legitimate usage constitutes a threat to safety.

(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-233. - Introduction. 
    In accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation and the City of Cartersville Safety Sensitive regulations, the City of Cartersville is adopting the following drug and alcohol-testing program. Any questions about this policy should be directed to Otis Chupp, Fire Chief and Safety Director, 19 N. Erwin Street, Cartersville, GA 30120, (770) 387-5635, pager no. (770) 583-1905. 
(1)  Scope. This policy applies to all full or part-time employees of the city who operate commercial motor vehicles and who are required to have commercial drivers license and those who have safety sensitive function as defined herein; the procedures for testing all employees covered herein shall be the same as required by 49-C.F.R. § 40 for individuals that have commercial drivers licenses. 
(2)  Effective date. This policy becomes effective October, 2005.

(5)  Employment terms. The at-will nature of employment relationship and the non-contractual nature of the policy that nothing in this policy is intended to modify the at-will nature of employment or to create a contract of employment between the employer and employee. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-234. - Prohibitions of alcohol and drug use. 
(a)  Alcohol use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (.04) or greater. Employees with an alcohol concentration of .04 or greater will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive functions. An employee whose test results indicate an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (.04), will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions until the start of the employees next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four (24) hours following the alcohol test. 
Employees are prohibited from possessing or using alcohol while on duty. Employees are prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions within four (4) hours after using alcohol. Following an accident, employees are prohibited from using alcohol for eight (8) hours or until undergoing a post-accident test. 
Misuse of alcohol is grounds for discharge from the city. 
(b)  Drug use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions when the employee uses drugs, unless the use is due to a physician's instruction who has advised the employee that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The employee must inform the employer of any such therapeutic drug use. If tested positive for drugs, employees are prohibited from reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or performing a safety function. A positive test fro use of controlled substances is grounds for discharge from the city. 
(c)  Refusal of test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test has the same consequences as a positive test result. If an employee fails to provide an adequate testing sample without a valid medical explanation or engages in conduct that obstructs the testing process, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-235. - Types of testing. 
(a)  Pre-employment testing. An employee applicant whom the city intends to hire or use shall be tested for the use of drugs, but not alcohol, as a condition of qualifications for employment. A drug test is also required whenever a current employee moves into a safety-sensitive position. No employee shall perform any safety-sensitive functions until a pre-employment test has indicated a verified negative result. 
(b)  Post-accident testing. When testing is required: 
(1)  The accident involved a fatality; or 
(2)  The driver receives a citation under the state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from an accident. 
a.  Injury requiring medical treatment away from the scene; or 
b.  One (1) or more vehicles incurring disabling damage* and having to be towed from the scene. 
*"Disabling damage" is damage which prevents a motor vehicle from leaving the scene of the accident in its usual manner, in daylight, after simple repairs. This includes a motor vehicle that could be driven but would be damaged further if driven. 
It does not include: 
 Damage that can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the accident without special tools or parts. 
 Tire disablement without other damage, even if no spare tire is available. 
 Headlight or tail light damage. 
 Damage to turn signals, horn, or windshield wipers which make them inoperative. 
If an alcohol test is not performed within two (2) hours of the accident, the city will prepare and maintain on file a record stating why the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test has not been conducted within eight (8) hours of the accident, no test will be conducted and the city will maintain the same record. If a drug test has not been administered within twelve (12) hours of the accident, no test will be administered and the city will maintain on file a statement of the reasons the test was not promptly administered. 
If an employee subject to post-accident testing does not remain readily available for such testing, he or she will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. However, an employee is allowed to get necessary emergency medical attention for injured people, or, if necessary, to leave the scene of an accident for the period necessary emergency medical care. The employee is responsible for ensuring that he or she complies with this section of the city's drug and alcohol testing program. 
(c)  Random testing. All CDL drivers and safety sensitive employees are subject to unannounced drug and alcohol testing. A random computer selection process will be used to select employees to be tested. Each employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. At least fifty (50) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for drug use. At least ten (10) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for alcohol use. The dates of testing will be spread reasonable throughout the calendar year. When supervisors are notified of selection of employees they are to proceed to testing site immediately with the employee. Do not let employee eat or drink or le them out of eyesight. 
Employees will be tested for alcohol use while performing safety-sensitive functions, just before performing safety-sensitive functions, or just after performing such functions. 
(d)  Reasonable suspicion testing. An employee shall submit to testing whenever the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is using a prohibited drug or is using alcohol in a prohibited manner. A decision to test will be made based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. "Reasonable suspicion:" means that the city believes that the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee are indicative of the use of drugs or alcohol. A reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use will be made by a supervisor or, when possible two (2) supervisors. A reasonable suspicion of alcohol misuse can only be made during, or just before or after, that period of the workday when the employee is engaged in the performance of a safety-sensitive function. After observation of suspect conduct, the employee should be transported immediately to a testing site. 
The mere possession of alcohol does not constitute a need for reasonable suspicion testing, which must be based on observations concerning the driver's appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor. 
Once behavioral, speech, and performance indicators show an employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, the employee must not report for, or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. An employee will only be permitted to resume performance after an alcohol test shows the employee's alcohol concentration at less than two hundredths (.02) or twenty-four (24) hours have elapsed following the determination of reasonable suspicion. If an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours following the supervisor's observation, a statement of the reasons for delay must be prepared and maintained on file. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight (8) hours, the employee will not be tested and a statement of the reasons for failure to administer the test will be prepared and maintained on file. 
Within twenty-four (24) hours of the observations being made or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier, documentation of the suspicion must be prepared and signed by the supervisor, or company official who made the observations. 
(e)  Return to duty testing. Any employee who has engaged in prohibited drug or alcohol use must undergo a drug or alcohol test before returning to duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. A drug test must indicate a verified negative result for drug use. An alcohol test must indicate an alcohol concentration of less than two hundredths (.02). 
(f)  Follow-up testing. An employee who returns to duty after a positive test is subject to follow-up testing. If a substance abuse professional determines that an employee needs help in resolving drug or alcohol abuse problems, follow-up drug and alcohol testing will be administered as directed by that substance abuse professional. At least six (6) tests are required in the first twelve (12) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. Follow-up testing will not exceed sixty (60) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. After the first six (6) tests, an employee may be released from the requirement of follow-up testing if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-236. - Drug testing procedures. 
    Drug testing procedure will be in accordance with the DOT's drug testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. Employer must notify the driver that the test is required under the regulations (49 CFR Part 40) before performing a drug test. Notice can be oral or written. Use of the "Controlled Substance Custody and Control Form" may serve as the required notice. The test will be performed using any approved DOT test method. The employee will be tested for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). Upon notification that a drug test is required, an employee must report immediately to a drug collection site. Unreasonable delay in reporting to a site after notification will be deemed a refusal to submit to testing. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-237. - Alcohol testing procedures. 
    Alcohol testing procedures will be in accordance with the DOT's alcohol testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. The test will be performed using breath or saliva samples. Upon notification that an alcohol test is required an employee must report immediately for alcohol testing and provide a breath or saliva specimen. If an employee fails to report to a testing facility in a reasonable time, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to alcohol testing. If the result of the initial test is an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, a confirmation test will be performed. For the purposes of this policy, alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohol including methyl and isopropyl alcohol in any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-238. - Supervisory training. 
    The city has established an education and training component for supervisory personnel who are authorized to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing under this policy. Every such supervisor shall receive at least two (2) hours of training on the specific indicators of probable drug or alcohol abuse. One (1) hour will cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and one (1) hour on the use of controlled substances. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-239. - Record keeping. 
    The city shall ensure that the following records are kept for a period of at least five (5) years; all records of positive drug results and alcohol test results indicating an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, documentation of refusal to take tests, calibration documentation, driver evaluation and referrals, and a copy of all annual calendar year summaries of the results of the city's drug and alcohol testing programs. Records related to the alcohol and drug collection process and training will be kept for a period of at least two (2) years. Records relating to negative and cancelled drug test results and alcohol test results with a concentration of less than two hundredths (.02) will be kept for one (1) year. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-240. - Notification of test results. 
    The city shall notify an employee of the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results were positive. The employee will also be advised what drug was discovered. In addition, the city shall notify an employee applicant of the results of a pre-employment drug test provided that the employee applicant requests such results within six (6) days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-241. - Access to facilities and records. 
    The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including any test records. In addition, federal, state, and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide information to an employee or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example, to worker's compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-242. - Release of test information by previous employers. 
    Within fourteen (14) days of the first time an employee performs a safety sensitive function for the city, the city is required by law to obtain information from an employee's previous employer on the employee's positive drug test results, alcohol test results of four hundredths (.04) or greater and refusals to be tested for drugs or alcohol within the preceding two (2) years. This information must be obtained with the consent of the employee. Other information relating to an employee's drug and alcohol use may be obtained, pursuant to the employee's consent, by the city. Any such request must be accompanied by the employee's written authorization for release of the information. Refusal to consent to release of this information by the employee has the same consequences as a positive test result. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-243. - Referral, evaluation, and treatment. 
    Any employee, except for any employee applicant who tests positive for drug use or alcohol misuse will be advised of the resources available to the employee in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of drugs including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. The city will bear the cost of providing this referral information. 
    In order for an employee who has tested positive for drug use or alcohol misuse to return to a position requiring the performance of a safety sensitive function, that employee must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional who will determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and drug use. Any employee identified as needing assistance in resolving such problems must successfully complete any rehabilitation program that is prescribed by a substance abuse professional before performing a safety sensitive function. Follow up testing will be conducted under the supervision of the substance abuse professional. Evaluation, assistance, rehabilitation, and follow up testing will be obtained, if at all, at the cost of the employee. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-244. - Penalties. 
    In addition to any discipline or discharge by the city, employees with commercial driver's licenses who violate federal regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing could be liable for penalties ranging from five hundred dollars ($500.00) to two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) and/or criminal penalties with a maximum fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisonment for up to ninety (90) days, or both. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-245. - Review and appeal. 
    Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within ten (10) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing. 
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
Sec. 2-246. - Alcohol testing. 
Subpart L-Alcohol screening tests. 
§ 40.241 What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test? 
    As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using: 
a)  When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test. 
b)  Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
1.  If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins. 
2.  If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test. 
c)  Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee. 
d)  If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number. 
e)  Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF. 
f)  Complete Step 1 of the ATF. 
g)  Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. 
Subpart L-Alcohol screening tests. 
§ 40.25 What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD? 
a)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD: 
1.  Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date. 
2.  Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee. 
3.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer. 
4.  If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test. 
5.  When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated. 
6.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device. 
(ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test. 
(iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
(iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
(v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
(vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test. 
7.  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)-(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

8.  You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF.

5.  If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
6.  When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear. 
7.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one. 
(ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test. 
(iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
(iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
(v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
(vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using another type of ASD (e.g., saliva device) or an EBT. 
8.  If you were able to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section, you must compare the color of the crystals in the device with the colored crystals on the manufacturer-produced control tube no sooner than the manufacturer instructs. In all cases color comparisons must take place within fifteen (15) minutes of the test.

The notice shall be delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was impounded. In addition, if the owner is unknown, notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(3)  Appeal hearing. If an animal is impounded pursuant to sections 5-16 or 5-18, and the owner thereof refuses to enter into a consent agreement with the animal shelter that such animal will be given humane care and adequate and necessary veterinary care, the owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five (5) business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found, within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of the notice of impoundment in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Hearing shall be in accordance with section 5-34. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal control officer. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. For impoundments under state charges, see subsection (c) below. 
(4)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment, the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
(b)  Impoundment for other reasons. Impoundments for reasons other than specified in subsection (a) above shall be subject to the following procedures: 
(1)  Determination. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the animal should be impounded under this chapter.

Return to the owner upon payment of fees shall not be an option for animals that are a threat to public safety or health, require quarantine, or where impounded for cruelty, inhumane treatment, dog fighting, other illegal action, vicious attacks, or other circumstances requiring a hearing under this chapter. 
(4)  Appeal hearing. The animal owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five (5) business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner or being posted in the case of abandoned dogs. Hearings shall be in accordance with section 5-34. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal control officer. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. 
(5)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment, the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter.

The provisions of subsections (a)(4) or (b)(5) of this section shall not apply to an animal that was an object or instrumentality of a crime nor shall any such animal be returned to the owner without the approval of the prosecuting attorney and animal control. If dogs are impounded for violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or O.C.G.A. § 16-12-37 (dog fighting), they shall not be returned to the owner until the case is completed, or unless otherwise ordered by the court. In such cases, the owner shall be required to post a surety bond for the costs of impoundment of the dog for the duration of the proceeding, in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per animal impounded, or shall release the animals to animal control for disposal. The surety bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state, or the bond may be paid in cash. If bond is not posted within thirty (30) days of impoundment, animal control shall apply to the court for permission to dispose of the animal prior to trial of the criminal case as provided by law. 
(d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

(2)  If the board finds that the animal was improperly impounded, the animal shall be returned to the owner and the costs incurred in providing reasonable care and treatment for the animal from the date of impoundment to the date of the order shall not be charged to the owner. If the animal is impounded under contract with a third party, the animal shelter shall pay for such costs of boarding and treatment; 
(3)  If the board finds that the animal was lawfully impounded, the board may: (a) recommend the shelter dispose of the animal in accordance with this section; or (b) unless, in a prior administrative or legal action, the owner has been found to have failed to provide humane care to an animal, committed cruelty to animals, or engaged in dog fighting in violation of the laws of this state or of the United States or any of the several states, recommend conditions under which the animal may, upon payment by the owner of all costs of impoundment and care, be returned to the owner. Such conditions shall be reduced to writing and served upon the owner and the animal shelter.

The owner shall be cited for violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Return of animals with violations.

(c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
    For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
(d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within two hundred seventy (270) days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Bartow County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within ninety (90) days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
(h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

(7)  Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the city for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits or sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the streets and other appurtenances. 
(b)  All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide, ten (10) feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten (10) feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe.

(Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98) 
Sec. 7.5-93. - Design criteria and materials for sewers. 
(1)  Generally. The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the city water department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature. 
(2)  Types of sewers. All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted. 
(3)  Design period. Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed along the entire road frontage of the property where gravity service is feasible and to the uppermost property line of the development being served. 
(4)  Capacity and size determinations. In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
(1)  Maximum hourly sewage flow. 
(2)  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
(3)  Ground water infiltration. 
(4)  Topography of the area. 
(5)  Depth of excavation. 
    New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than four hundred (400) gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half (21/2) times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) pipe diameter. 
    The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination. 
(5)  Special city requirements. 
(a)  Distance between manholes. Maximum distance between manholes shall be four hundred (400) feet. 
(b)  Depth. Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five (5) feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be fifteen (15) feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of twelve (12) feet unless otherwise approved. Any sewers on off-street easements shall have a minimum of three (3) feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed. 
(c)  Drop across manholes. All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of one-fourth (0.25) feet. 
(d)  Detection tape. Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals. 
(6)  Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two (2.0) feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 
Minimum Slope in Feet 
Sewer Size 
(in inches) Per 100 Feet 8 0.40 10 0.29 12 0.22 14 0.17 15 0.15 16 0.14 18 0.12 21 0.10 24 0.08  
  
These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two (2.0) feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on ten (10) percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See standard details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be twenty (20) percent and sewers shall be designed at less than ten (10) percent whenever possible unless otherwise approved. 
(7)  Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a large one (1), the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
(8)  Gravity sewer pipe materials. The city reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through fifteen-inch diameter will normally be polyvinyl chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile iron pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of DIP). For eighteen-inch diameter pipe and above, the contractor may have the option of using either polyvinyl chloride (PVC), reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), or ductile iron pipe. Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details): 
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six (6) inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
For ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of pipe. 
In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
(a)  Ductile iron pipe (DIP). 
1.  Scope. Ductile iron sewer pipe shall be required at all utility crossings with less than two (2) feet of clearance, in locations where cover is less than three (3) feet, at stream crossings, where slopes exceed ten (10) percent, and where cover exceeds fifteen (15) feet.

Pipes shall be tested in straight alignment, axially deflected position, and by shear load test as otherwise defined in Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 of ASTM D3212. 
8.  Installation. PVC pipe will be installed in accordance with ASTM D2321 (latest revision). Initial backfill shall be compacted to the densities outlined in D2321. The city may require random compaction tests at the developer's expense to insure compliance with D2321. 
9.  Deflection limit. Vertical deflection of installed pipe shall not exceed five (5) percent of the undeflected diameter as defined in ASTM D3034. 
Upon completion of the pipe laying, the pipe will be tested for conditional acceptance. The test shall be performed by the contractor pulling a mandrel of specified dimensions through the pipeline. 
(c)  Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). 
1.  General. The use of reinforced concrete pipe for sewers will be subject to approval on a case-by-case basis depending upon size of the sewer and site conditions. When approved for use, concrete gravity sewer pipe shall meet all materials and testing requirements of ASTM C-76, ASTM C-443, and ASTM C-497 (except where modified herein). 
2.  Quality assurance.

Once the contractor begins work, he shall proceed in a workmanlike manner and shall complete the work in a reasonable time without undue off days and periods of inactivity which make it hard for the city to keep up with his activity. 
(3)  Changes from approved plans. Any major changes from the approved plans will require that the engineer submit revised drawings along with a request explaining the reason for the change prior to construction of the change. Any deviation from city standards will be considered a major change as will any change that will affect capacity, longevity, operation or maintenance of the facility. Any deviation from approved materials will not be accepted without prior approval. 
(4)  Trench excavation. Sewer lines shall normally be installed by open-cut trench excavation. Trenches shall be cut true to the lines and grades shown on the plans. 
    Pipe trenches shall not be excavated more than one hundred (100) feet in advance of pipe laying, and all work shall be performed to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. Adequate temporary bridges or crossings shall be constructed and maintained where required to permit uninterrupted vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
    All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights in compliance with all OSHA and state department of transportation requirements so as to protect the public and workers from hazard. 
    Excavations adjacent to existing or proposed buildings and structures, or in paved streets or alleys shall be adequately protected by the use of trench boxes, sheeting, shoring and bracing to prevent cave-ins of the excavation, or the undermining or subsequent settlement of adjacent structures or pavements. Underpinning of adjacent structures shall be done when necessary to maintain structures in safe condition. 
    Streets, sidewalks, landscapes, and other public and private property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored to as near as original condition as possible or better in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
    Trenches shall be kept free of water by pumping or well-pointing, as determined by the contractor. No structure shall be built or pipe shall be laid in water. Water shall not be allowed to flow over or rise upon any concrete, masonry or pipe until the same has been inspected and the concrete or joint material has thoroughly set. All water pumped, bailed, or otherwise removed from the trench or other excavation shall be conveyed in a proper manner to a suitable place of discharge. Such discharge shall not cause injury to public health, property, work completed, work in progress, or to any street surface, or cause any interference with the use of same by the public. 
    Construction occurring around active sewer systems shall be done in such a way so as to prevent the spillage of wastewater. 
(5)  Rock excavation. Drilling and blasting operations shall be conducted with due regard for the safety of persons and property in the vicinity and in strict conformity with requirements of all ordinances, laws and regulations governing blasting and the use of explosives. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. Injury or damage to other structures and properties are the sole responsibility of the installation contractor and shall be promptly repaired by the contractor to the satisfaction of the city and property owner. Rock in trenches shall be excavated over the horizontal limits of excavation and to depths as follows: 
Size of Pipeline 
(in inches) Depth of 
Excavation 
Below Bottom of 
Sewer Pipe 
(in inches) 4 to 8 6 8 to 18 8 18 to 30 10

    All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site. 
    Sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be non-toxic and supplied or approved for use by the pipe manufacturer. Sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the city. 
    When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of installed pipe shall be plugged with a watertight plug to prevent entrance of trench water into the line. 
    Bedding for pipe shall normally be as listed below (also see city standard details): 
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below the bottom of the pipe to six (6) inches above the top of the pipe for the full width of the trench. 
For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe and initial backfill to the top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
    Backfill material up to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe shall be compacted dry, loose, soil unless PVC is used in which case the first six (6) inches above the top of pipe is required to be crushed stone. If such material is not available from the site then #57 stone shall be used to backfill up to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe. Backfilling the remainder of the trench may utilize soil and blasted rock (not over twelve (12) inches in any dimension) compacted sufficiently to avoid excessive settlement. Under no circumstances will tree parts, vegetation, building materials or any other type of debris be used for backfill. 
    All backfill beneath roads, sidewalks or other critical areas shall be compacted to ninety-five (95) percent Standard Proctor or as otherwise required by the DOT or other such agency having jurisdiction using mechanical tamping equipment.

    The carrier pipe shall be fitted with approved spacers to secure its position within the casing. At each end of the casing pipe the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
(11)  Replacement of pavement. Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and other surface structures removed or disturbed, to a condition that is equal to or better than the original condition in a manner satisfactory to the city (see standard details). 
(12)  Location/protection of existing underground utilities. It is the responsibility of the contractor to locate all underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the contractor shall be repaired by the contractor at the contractor's own expense. The contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of the Utilities Protection Code. 
(13)  Protection of water supply and other utilities. The city has an established cross-connection program (3/6/86) to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections. It is illegal to introduce any substance into or to have any cross connections with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply. 
    Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten (10) feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten (10) feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches. 
(14)  Sewer services. A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two (2) feet/second sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two (2) or more buildings. The service shall extend to five (5) feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten (10) feet of the lower corner of the lot. All service laterals shall be a minimum of five (5) feet deep at the property line. Where five (5) feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A ninety-degree bend, constructed from two (2) forty-five-degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum of four (4) feet above existing ground level (See standard details). Connections to the main exceeding eight (8) feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five-foot lateral depth at the property line. 
    The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. 
    Install fourteen (14) gauge detector wire on all laterals. 
    The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The city will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
    No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for his connection. Also, any service provided will be utilized without the installation of additional services. 
(15)  Clean up. Prior to requesting the "completion of sewer construction" inspection, the contractor shall remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, spacers, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
    Any work areas within public right-of-way or property outside of the development that were damaged by the sewer construction shall be repaired or replaced with the same kind of material as existed prior to the damage occurring. All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush-hog equipment. 
    All shoulders, ditches, culverts, and other areas impacted by the sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
    A uniform stand of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, is required over all construction easements and sanitary sewer easements prior to the city's acceptance of the sewer. Use a grass mixture consisting of at least fifty (50) percent fescue. 
(Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98; Ord. No. 50-98, § 7, 1-7-99) 
Sec. 7.5-95. - Inspection of sewers. 
(1)  City inspection. The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work. City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The city shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. 
(2)  Access to project. Authorized representatives of the city, which may include city employees, the city engineer, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
(3)  Communications during construction. A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The developer has sole responsibility for scheduling. The developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the city and all private utilities in this conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing two (2) days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection. The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. 
(4)  Concealed work. The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the city's discretion, the city may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling. 
(5)  Minimum inspection by developer. The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer: 
(a)  Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring as-built distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole. 
(b)  Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done. 
(6)  City inspection. Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer. 
(a)  Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover. 
(b)  Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least eighty (80) percent of a full circle when observed from one (1) end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches (11/2) of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine failing sections of sewers. 
(c)  Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
(d)  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two (2) tests per five hundred (500) feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one (1) additional area will be tested as well. 
(7)  Other testing requirements. The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city. The city will be notified at least two (2) days prior to these tests. 
(a)  Mandrel test for PVC pipe. Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to ninety-five (95) percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter): 
1.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
2.  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line (a nylon ski rope is recommended). 
3.  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
4.  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
5.  Draw the mandrel through the sewer line. 
6.  An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine locations of failing sewers. 
7.  Retest. 
(b)  Air pressure test. A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
1.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two (2) manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
2.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches four and one-half (4.5) psig above ground water pressure, if any. 
3.  Wait at least five (5) minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
4.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
5.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to two and one-half (2.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
6.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown on the following table: 
Pipe 
Diameter 
(in inches) Seconds 
Per 100 
Feet of 
Pipe Pipe 
Diameter 
(in inches) Seconds

Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the city witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two (2) feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 
(c)  Manhole testing. All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test. 
1.  Exfiltration test. Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one (1) hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two (2) gallons/foot of depth/foot of manhole diameter. 
2.  Vacuum test. Vacuum testing of manholes for watertightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten (10) inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of sixty (60) seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine (9) inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine (9) inches, the manhole has failed. 
(8)  Final inspection and conditional acceptance. In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the city. The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project. 
    After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter, certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the twelve-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development. 
    At the end of twelve (12) months, the subdivision inspection team will again reinspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system. 
(9)  Maintenance bond or letter of credit. The developer shall post a maintenance bond or letter of credit of ten (10) percent of the total project cost on the facility for an eighteen-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city for all projects whose costs exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). 
(10)  Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for a twelve-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the twelve-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the sewer system for operation.

Trenches shall be free of water during the work. 
    Water lines shall have a minimum cover of forty-two (42) inches. All changes in grade shall be made gradually. At points of interference with storm sewers and cross drains, pipe will be run under the conflicting utility if the minimum cover cannot be maintained by going over the top of the pipe. 
    In laying pipe across water courses, railroad crossings, or depressions of any kind, the minimum depth here specified shall be maintained at the bottom of the depression. 
    Where necessary, the line shall be lowered at valves so that the top of the valve stem is approximately one (1) foot below the finished grade. The trench shall be deepened to provide a gradual approach to all low points of the line. 
(b)  Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. Before blasting, the contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to protect the adjacent property owners from damage. All rock encountered shall be removed six (6) inches below the bottom grade of the trench and the trench built back to the correct grade with suitable material tamped into place. Sides of the trench shall be trimmed of projecting rock that will interfere with backfilling operations. The contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting. Rock excavation by blasting shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet in advance of pipe laying.

All piping to be tested must satisfactorily comply with the pressure tests before being eligible for acceptance. In general, tests shall be conducted in accordance with AWWA Standard C-600 except as otherwise herein specified. 
(2)  Testing. 
(a)  After all piping has been placed, each run shall be tested by the contractor in the presence of the inspector and tests shall be continued until all leaks have been made tight to the satisfaction of the inspector. The contractor shall furnish all necessary water, meters, pumps, gauges, bulkheads, and other materials and appliances necessary to conduct the test as herein required. Every precaution must be taken to valve-off or otherwise protect control equipment in or attached to the pipe line to prevent damage or injury thereto. All piping shall be tested at two hundred (200) psi for a minimum test duration of one (1) hour. The city or its representative may require a twenty-four-hour test if it so desires. 
(b)  Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If hydrants, blow-offs or air release valves are not available at the high places, the contractor shall make the necessary taps, as per the standard detail for tap construction, at points of highest elevation before the test is made and close the corporation stop after the test has been completed. 
(c)  Prior to the pressure test, pipe laid in trenches shall be backfilled adequately to secure the pipe during the test. Any observed leakage shall require corrective measures to pipe lines and/or joints as otherwise provided for in these specifications and to the satisfaction of the inspector. During the final pressure test the specified pressure shall be maintained in the pipe being tested for a minimum time of one (1) hour. Test pressure shall be maintained within five (5) psi of the specified test pressure for the duration of the test. Should the pressure drop more than five (5) psi at any time during the test period, the pressure shall be restored to the specified test pressure. An accurate pressure gauge with graduation not greater than five (5) psi shall be used. 
(d)  The city will furnish the necessary water for testing the lines. However, any water lost through breakage of lines or unnecessary or excessive flushing of line will be charged to the contractor. Each valved section must be flushed and tested at a pressure of two hundred (200) psi for one (1) hour. Lines shall be tested in sections in a manner that assures testing of the tapping valve and all main line valves. When testing at the above specified pressures, the rate of leakage shall not exceed fifteen (15) gallons per twenty-four (24) hours per inch diameter per mile of line. See the table below.

Any section of the line not meeting the above test shall have the leaks found and corrected at once and re-tested until the leakage falls within the limits specified above. Leakage shall be defined as the sum of the quantity of water that must be pumped into the test section to maintain the pressure within five (5) psi of the specified test pressure for the test duration plus water required to return the line to test pressure at the end of the test. 
(e)  All fire hydrants shall be flushed to check operations. 
(f)  All valves shall be located and operation checked. 
(3)  Disinfection. After leakage testing, and all necessary repairs have been made, the lines shall be flushed clean and then disinfected in strict accordance with AWWA Standard For Disinfecting Water Mains, AWWA C651, latest revision subject to the following special conditions: 
(a)  The method of disinfection shall be the continuous-feed method as follows: 
1.  Apply chlorine solution to achieve a concentration of at least twenty-five (25) milligrams per liter free chlorine in new line. Retain chlorinated water for twenty-four (24) hours. 
2.  Chlorine concentration shall be recorded at selected outlets along the line at the beginning and end of the twenty-four-hour period. 
3.  After twenty-four (24) hours, all samples of water shall contain at least ten (10) milligrams per liter free chlorine. Re-chlorinate if results are not obtained on all samples. 
(b)  The form of chlorine may be either: (1) a one (1) percent solution made from either sodium hypochlorite or calcium chlorine gas cylinder supplying a vacuum-type chlorinator, or (2) making a solution and pumping it into the pipeline. 
(c)  The contractor shall dechlorinate the highly-chlorinated water being flushed from the pipeline or otherwise dispose of in a manner complying with state environmental regulations. 
(d)  The developer shall be responsible for collecting bacteriological samples under city supervision. The city shall perform the initial bacteriological testing of water samples from the disinfected pipeline at no charge. The contractor shall be responsible for charges on all failed tests. 
(e)  Before any flushing or disinfection work is begun, the contractor shall outline his planned procedures for these tasks and obtain approval of the city. 
(4)  Contractor qualifications. 
(a)  Licensing and safety. All contractors who work on water systems that will be owned by the city must be licensed in accordance with state law and local ordinance. Compliance with applicable safety regulations is the responsibility of each company engaged in the work; the city assumes no responsibility for the actions of others on the job site. It is the responsibility of those installing water mains and related appurtenances to conform to OSHA regulations, 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart P, Paragraph 1926.650 through 1926.653. Publications from OSHA can be obtained by contacting OSHA Publications Distribution, Washington, D.C. 
(b)  Contractors performing water system installations must be approved by the city and should be completely familiar with the procedures and contract requirements associated with this type project. 
(c)  Unsatisfactory work will cause a contractor not to be given a permit for future work. 
(5)  Construction inspection. 
(a)  Responsibility for inspection. The developer will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work. City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The city shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. The contractor shall leave trenches open at critical locations to allow visual inspection of fittings, valves and hydrants prior to backfilling. The city maintains the right to refuse performing inspections at unsafe worksites. 
(b)  Access to project. Authorized representatives of the city, which may include city employees, the city, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
(c)  Communications during construction. All written communications regarding water construction shall be directed to the city water department. The developer shall be responsible for scheduling a preconstruction conference between their contractor and utilities and affected city departments prior to any construction activities. 
    After a preconstruction conference has been held the contractor will notify the city in writing two (2) days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The owner/developer shall request the final inspection in writing. 
    The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. 
(d)  Concealed work. The contractor shall notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as valves, fittings, bends, tees, fire hydrants, pipe bedding, reaction blocking, lot services, or other appurtenances. 
(e)  As-built drawings provided by design professional. As-built drawings will be provided and certified by the design professional who is employed by the developer. As-builts drawings shall be submitted showing the horizontal location of the mains, main size, valve, hydrant, and service line and meter location. Locations shall be referenced to a fixed landmark where necessary. Provide detail drawings of crossings with other utilities showing vertical and horizontal clearances. 
(f)  Minimum testing. All costs for testing required by the city shall be paid for by the developer. 
1.  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing will be required for mains constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two (2) tests at each road crossing will be conducted at varying depths as fill is being placed. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one (1) additional area will be tested as well. 
2.  Pressure and disinfection tests. Pressure and disinfection tests shall be observed until each test is passing. 
(6)  Final inspection and conditional acceptance. Prior to final inspection of the water system the developer shall have previously completed the pressure and disinfection tests. After the developer makes written request for final inspection, the city will schedule a final inspection. The contractor and the developer will be present during this final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of hydrants, valves and other appurtenances and a complete overview of the project. 
    After any discrepancies are corrected and approved as built drawings are submitted, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the water system. This letter shall commence the start of the twelve-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. On projects having phased development, this letter will clearly identify portions of the project being accepted. 
    At the end of twelve (12) months, the subdivision inspection team will again reinspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the water system. 
(7)  Maintenance bond or letter of credit. The developer shall post a maintenance bond or letter of credit of ten (10) percent of the total project cost on the facility for an eighteen-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city for all projects whose cost exceeds twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). 
(8)  Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for a twelve-month period after acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the twelve-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the water system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the water system for maintenance.

ARTICLE VI. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT/FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 04-15, adopted Mar. 5, 2015, repealed the former art. VI, §§ 7.5-151-7.5-157, and enacted a new art. VI as set out herein. The former art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, adopted Aug. 27, 1998; and Ord. No. 60-06, adopted Aug. 17, 2006. 

Sec. 7.5-150. - Introduction. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
    The flood hazard areas of the City of Cartersville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
    Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
    Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Cartersville, Georgia, does ordain the ordinance codified in this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
    Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the county integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process. 
    The article requires that the county regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land use conditions, which are based upon the communities adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The ordinance also requires the county to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres and greater. 
    In order to administer the ordinance, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established: 
(1)  Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one (1) square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, District-Wide Watershed Management Plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten (10) percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community. 
(2)  For streams with a drainage area between one hundred (100) acres and six hundred forty (640) acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains or require the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant. 
(3)  For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 04-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
Sec. 7.5-151. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
(6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Cartersville. 
(c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city engineer, chief building official or their designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of the ordinance codified in this article. 
(d)  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics - flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "areas of special flood hazard," "areas of future-conditions flood hazard," "areas of shallow flooding," "base flood elevations," "floodplains," "floodways," "future-conditions flood elevations," "future-conditions floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
(1)  The Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated September 28, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. [For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for (Bartow County), dated September 28, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto.] 
(2)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one (1) percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Cartersville; and 
b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA-approved methodology and approved by the City of Cartersville. 
(3)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Cartersville; and 
b.  Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Carteresville. 
(4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at the office of public works. 
(e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Cartersville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure; provided that, the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    "Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 04-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
Sec. 7.5-154. - Standards for development. 
(a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
(1)  Studied "A" Zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(2)  For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Cartersville. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Cartersville, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Cartersville. 
(b)  Definition of floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Cartersville. If floodway data is not available from the City of Cartersville, it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Cartersville. 
(1)  Developments or subdivisions. If the request involves a development or subdivision, the developer or subdivider shall either pay for the city to conduct the study, or shall pay an impendent consultant to provide the data, provided that consultant is first approved by the city engineer. If floodway data is provided by the city, the developer or subdivider shall pay the pro rata share of the costs of the consultant to map the relevant basin. 
(2)  Individual lots. If the request involves an individual lot not part of a larger common plan of development, or a pre-existing lot in an existing subdivision, then the individual shall consult with the city engineer. The city engineer shall make the determination whether to require additional floodway data at the applicant's expense, to expedite county mapping of the relevant area, or to accept the existing data as sufficient. 
(c)  General standards. 
(1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(2)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection 7.5-154(a) shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two (2.0) percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection 7.5-154(d); 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Cartersville using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Cartersville prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Cartersville. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments; 
(5)  Detailed flood studies in areas where floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established and in areas beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which may contain a watercourse, and have greater than one hundred (100) acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be submitted showing the base flood elevations, future-conditions flood elevations, and the floodway. Approval of the study must be received before the final plat of the affected lots can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
(e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (e)(2) below; 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Cartersville until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Cartersville. 
(f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The City of Cartersville may direct the property owner (at no cost to City of Cartersville) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Cartersville.

Sec. 7.5-156. - Variance procedures. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article: 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the City of Cartersville Board of Zoning Appeals. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures established by the zoning ordinance for the board of zoning appeals regarding notice, hearing procedure, and other matters not covered herein. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Cartersville shall have the right to appeal such decision to the board of zoning appeals (BZA) as established by the City of Cartersville in accordance with procedures of the BZA. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the BZA may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Bartow County. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the City of Cartersville and the BZA shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage provided. 
d.  The ordinance administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Cartersville and the BZA shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the City of Cartersville and the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

(Ord. No. 11-10, 5-6-10; Ord. No. 27-16, § 1, 11-17-16) 
Sec. 7.5-184. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16), (17), and (18) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 7.5-184(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
(18)  Construction site operators shall control waste at the construction site, such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 11-10, 5-6-10; Ord. No. 35-15, § 1, 11-19-15; Ord. No. 27-16, § 1, 11-17-16) 
Sec. 7.5-185. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Cartersville without first obtaining a permit from the City of Cartersville Planning and Development Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Cartersville Planning and Development Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 7.5-184(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  The following fees shall be addressed: 
a.  Initial application fee: Five hundred dollars ($500.00); 
b.  Reapplication fee: Fifty dollars ($50.00) each occurrence; 
c.  Land-disturbance permit: Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00); 
d.  Plus the following additional fees: 
1.  For residential development: Fifteen dollars ($15.00) per lot in the project area; 
2.  For commercial development: Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per acre or fraction thereof in the project area; 
3.  For industrial development; Fifty dollars ($50.00) per acre or fraction thereof in the project area; 
4.  All other development: Twenty dollars ($20.00) per acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
5.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division; regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 7.5-184(c) (15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) below, of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(7)  A mandatory preconstruction meeting shall be required prior to the issuance of land-disturbance permits on projects subject to the rules and regulations of this article. Points of discussion in the preconstruction meeting will include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  NOI on file. 
b.  Proof of NOI fee payment on file. 
c.  Design professional seven-day inspection letter. 
d.  State waters, buffers and floodplains on site.

(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 7.5-184(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 7.5-184(c) (15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 11-10, 5-6-10; Ord. No. 27-16, § 1, 11-17-16) 
Sec. 7.5-186. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The City of Cartersville Engineer, Chief Building Official, or their designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The City of Cartersville Engineer, Chief Building Official, or their designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

Sec. 7.5-187. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
(3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 7.5-185(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one (1) alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

ARTICLE IX. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 7.5-221. - Introduction. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
    Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. 
    Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
    The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
    These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits. 
    Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
    Therefore, the City of Cartersville has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 61-06, § 1, 8-17-06) 
Sec. 7.5-222. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
a.  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one (1) acre or more; 
b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one (1) acre or more; 
c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the ordinance administrator to be a hotspot land use; or 
d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items a. and b. above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the ordinance administrator. 
(c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city engineer or their designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(e)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(f)  Stormwater design manual. The City of Cartersville will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

    The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City of Cartersville are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
(This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity.) 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 7.5-225(2)b. is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. (This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.) 
(4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. (This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.) 
(5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from City of Cartersville before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of Cartersville may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 7.5-225(1). The applicant may, if approved by the City of Cartersville, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.

ARTICLE X. - MODEL ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

Sec. 7.5-241. - Introduction. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
    Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
    These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
    These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
    The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
    These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
    Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
    Therefore, the City of Cartersville adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

(2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure, building, object, or work of art which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of preservation by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, and in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.

(d)  Design guidelines. The following design guidelines are adopted for the Downtown Business Historic District: 
CARTERSVILLE 
HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION 
DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
GENERAL GUIDELINES 
PART ONE 
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO THE HISTORIC DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
    Preservation of character-defining elements of historic buildings is a priority, and alterations and repairs should accurately represent the historic qualities of the buildings. Original documentation should be used for restoration work wherever possible. Where original documentation is unavailable, interpretations of similar elements that occurred in the area may be considered. 
    In filing for a certificate of appropriateness all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application. Recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in your application for a COA. Maintenance recommendations are included for informational purposes only and are not to be included in an application for COA, and as such shall not be considered by the commission in reviewing said applications. 
1.  Changes in use: 
Recommendation: 
A change in use is not regulated, but every reasonable effort should be made to provide a compatible use for the building that will require minimal alteration to the building and its site. 
2.  Original design character: 
Requirement: 
Respect the original design character of the building. Analyze the building to determine which elements are essential to its character. Do not try to make the building appear older or younger in style than it really is. The genuine heritage of the Historic Downtown Business District should be expressed. 
3.  Historical changes: 
Requirement: 
Preserve older alterations that have achieved historic significance in themselves. Examples would be an addition or entryway that was added to the original building early in its history. More recent alterations that are not historically significant may be removed. 
4.  Plan and implement strategies: 
Requirement: 
Evaluate the historic property and establish a plan for implementing strategies for preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, reconstruction, alterations to the exterior, and additions. 
Rehabilitation work should not destroy the distinguishing character of the property or its environment. Match the original material when feasible. A substitute material is acceptable if the form and design of the substitute conveys the visual appearance of the original. 
Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Patch, piece-in, splice, consolidate, or otherwise upgrade the existing material using recognized preservation methods whenever possible. If alternative materials must be used, they should match the original in appearance as closely as possible. 
Replacement of missing architectural elements should be based on accurate duplications of original features. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced in design, color, texture, and other physical qualities. The design should be substantiated by physical or pictorial evidence. 
Where reconstruction of an element is impossible because of lack of historical evidence, a new design that relates to the building in general size, scale and material may be considered using design elements that reflect the building's style. 
During repair or rehabilitation, protect and maintain historic features that survive in generally good condition. Treatments include rust removal, caulking, sealing and repainting. Original materials and details that contribute to the historic significance of the structure should be preserved whenever feasible. 
When disassembly of an historic element is necessary for its rehabilitation, use methods that minimize damage to the original materials. Always devise methods of replacing the disassembled materials in their original configuration. 
5.  Roofs: 
Requirement: 
Preserve original pitch and shape of the roof forms where they contribute to the historic character of the building. Do not use shingled mansard roofs. Replace existing roof materials with the same type of material where it is visible from the street. Rooftop mechanical systems, satellite dishes, and microwave dishes should be unobtrusive and out of public view when possible. 
Maintain historic chimneys. Preserve historic skylights whenever possible. Do not remove ornamental roof features. 
6.  Cornices: 
A cornice is the decorative strip along the top of most historic commercial buildings. It caps off the facade physically and visually. Cornices are usually constructed of brick, wood, cast iron, or sheet metal, and occasionally the horizontal supporting beam itself ads as a cornice. 
Requirement: 
Whenever possible, the original cornice should be preserved. Damaged cornices should be repaired without disturbing the rest of the cornice, using similar materials. 
7.  Upper fronts: 
Requirement: 
The upper front of a building is the section of the facade above the main storefront to assist in making a business look alive, upper floors should appear occupied. Do not fill in upper windows. 
A second story addition must be in keeping with the historical architecture of the building. Do not construct a front porch or balcony where none existed before. 
8.  Facades: 
The basic commercial facade consists of two (2) main parts: the storefront with an entrance and display windows; and the upper front, usually with regularly spaced windows and a cornice at top of the building. The storefront and upper front are visually important. 
Requirement: 
The elements of the facade should be retained as closely as possible to those of the original structure, using existing original materials whenever possible. 
If parts of the facade are missing, design and reconstruction should be based on historical, pictorial, or physical documentation. When documentation is unavailable, a new design for a missing element should be compatible with the size, scale, and material of the historic building. 
9.  Exteriors: 
Requirement: 
Do not paint, coat, or waterproof unpainted masonry. Do not sandblast exterior surfaces. Use the gentlest means possible to clean exterior materials. 
When repainting brick, use historic mortar mix (softer than modern mixes), matching the original mortar joints. The Stein Building on West Main Street is a good example of this process. 
Maintain historic exterior materials. Repair, as part of renovation, damaged exterior materials with like materials- and only in the area of damage. Do not use imitation brick or stone, wood or metal siding, or aggregates on the building facade. 
Recommendation: 
Maintain historic exterior materials. Repair, as part of maintenance, damaged exterior materials with like materials and only in the area of damage. Do not use imitation brick or stone, wood or metal siding, or aggregates on the building facade. 
10.  Storefronts: 
Common historic storefront design consists of large, thinly framed windows and a recessed entrance. Frequently there is a cornice at the top of the storefront to separate it from the upper facade, and low bulkheads at the base of the storefront to protect the windows and define the entrance. 
Requirement: 
Historic storefronts should be repaired rather than replaced or covered. Retain original elements, such as bulkheads or cast iron columns. Storefronts can consist of a variety of materials, but the overall image should be simple and unobtrusive, using materials similar to those of the rest of the building. If replacement of elements is required new materials should match the original in placement, composition, design, texture and other visual qualities. The frame can be wood, cast iron, or anodized aluminum. Bulkheads are generally wood panels, aluminum-clad plywood, polished stone, glass, or tile. 
Where the original storefront no longer exists, replacement should be based on historical research and physical evidence and be compatible with nearby historic building. Do not extend the storefront out of its place in the facade. It should be in the same plane as the upper facade and not extend beyond the original opening. 
Retain transom windows, reopening previously covered transoms whenever possible. Do not enclose, replace the window type, cover, or install air-conditioning units in transom windows. 
11.  Exterior details: 
Requirement: 
Details can be some of the most striking elements of a building's facade. Since the design and size of many commercial buildings are quite similar, their unique decorations should be noted and preserved. 
Subtle wood details, as in window moldings should be retained. Do not add architectural details where none existed before, such as colonial doors, small windowpanes, or storefront shutters. 
Decorative tile should be retained, as should structural or pigmented glass such as beveled, stained, leaded, and etched glass, where they contribute to the original historic value. 
During repair, renovation or rehabilitation, all decorative terra cotta and all forms of brick work and stonework should be repaired and maintained. Cast iron and sheet metal decorations, common on many nineteenth century buildings, should be preserved. 
Recommendation: 
Decorative terra cotta and all forms of brickwork and stonework should be repaired and maintained. 
12.  Windows-Storefront: 
Requirement: 
Retain the large display windows characteristic of commercial buildings in their original size, shape, and proportions, and use original materials whenever possible. Preserve original window components, replacing only damaged portions. When replacing glass or restoring windows, retain the original size and shape of the storefront opening. 
Display windows should use clear glass only; transom windows can be clear, tinted or stained. Neither should have dividing mulls. 
Restore previously enclosed display windows when the original design is documented. 
Do not fill in window spaces or add storm windows which obscure the historic windows. If dropped ceilings cover part of the window openings, have the drop setback so the entire window space appears open from the outside. Interior window treatments should not change the overall character of the windows. Do not add merely decorative exterior shutters that do not fit the windows. 
Recommendation: 
Traditional storefronts are composed almost entirely of glass, allowing natural lights to enter what is typically a long and narrow space that contains no other windows. This storefront attracts business and should be well maintained. 
13.  Windows-Upper front: 
Requirement: 
Existing windows should be repaired whenever possible, using similar materials. If required, replacement windows should match the original in materials, configuration, and style, and fill the entire opening. If aluminum frame is used, paint it to match the remaining windows. Storm windows should be either mounted inside or painted to match the window sash. 
Recommendation: 
Upper story windows help tie together all the facades on a street. They give a building the appearance of vitality and should not be filled in or covered over. If the space is vacant, appropriate shades, curtains or other interior window treatments should be used. 
14.  Awnings and canopies: 
The canvas awning was an important design element common in the traditional storefront. They help shelter passersby, reduce glare, and conserve energy by controlling the amount of sunlight that hits the store windows. Movable awnings can be retracted allowing the sun to shine into your building in the winter and can be extended to shade the storefront from summer heat. Awnings can also effectively and tactfully disguise inappropriate storefront alterations. 
Requirement: 
There are a variety of materials for awnings, including canvas, vinyl-coated canvas, and the synthetic material carillon. Standard street-level awnings should be mounted between the display windows and the first-floor cornice or sign panel with the valance about seven (7) feet above the sidewalk. They should reinforce the frame of the storefront without covering up the side piers, and should project four (4) to seven (7) feet from the building. A twelve-inch valance flap is usually attached at the awning bar and can serve as a sign panel. 
Canopies, however, especially large ones that are an integral part of the building, may still be intact and should be preserved. Smaller canopies may benefit from the addition of a canvas over the rails, and a twelve- to twenty-four-inch skirt along the front and sides. 
Recommendation: 
Since the average life of an awning is between four (4) and seven (7) years, the only records of authentic awnings are old photographs or renderings, unless they have been maintained regularly through the years. Always check any old photographs available for awnings on your building. 
An awning can bring attention to your building but careful attention should be given to its design. Consider how it will appear in relation to the scale of your building to others on the street. An intelligently designed and placed awning can save you money, identify your storefront, and create a nice sidewalk area for customers. 
15.  Entrances: 
Requirement: 
Retain original recessed entries where they exist. Use building symmetry to suggest location, preferably recessed and canted. Retain tiled entryway floors. On upper levels, maintain historic door placements; do not add new entrances to secondary levels on the facade. 
Entrance doors on historical commercial buildings usually have a large clear glass panel and are made of wood, steel, or aluminum. When restoring, paint the frames a compatible color with the rest of the facade. Replacement doors should resemble the original in design and proportions. 
Retain doors, hardware, trim and the original number of doors and their locations. Do not install unfinished aluminum doors or residential doors. Do not add transoms or sidelights were none existed before. 
16.  Additions: 
Requirement: 
Additions should be placed away from public view at the rear of the building or well behind the facade. Maintain the form, orientation and symmetry of the original structure. 
Create a discernible break at the juncture with the original structure. Walls of the addition should not be flush with the original structure. Ideally, the addition should be able to be removed without substantial loss of historic materials and elements. 
Use matching or similar elements for style, roofing, siding, and windows. 
Requirement: 
Parking lots should not be the main focus of the front of the building. 
PART TWO 
GUIDELINES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IN HISTORIC 
DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
1.  Building form and scale: 
Requirements: 
Any new building constructed in the Historic Downtown Business District area will make a significant visual impact on the streetscape. It is important to consider the character and scale of the surroundings and adjacent buildings to insure the new structure will be compatible. New buildings should appear similar in mass and scale to historic structures in the area. Use building forms and roof forms that match those used historically. Any addition to an existing structure must also conform to the historic district. 
Building height should be comparable to adjacent structures. Where new building facades will be wider than those found traditionally, subdivide the surface into promotions similar in scale to historic fades by varying setback, roof forms, and materials. New construction should be sensitive to the size, scale, proportion, material, shape, texture, and rhythm of its neighbors. 
2.  Reconstruction: 
Requirements: 
Infill designs should not attempt to duplicate the period and style of the adjacent buildings, or try to look "old" by using period proportions and materials. The designs should complement the buildings in the area but represent the style of the period in which it is built. 
When a contemporary depiction is required to understand and interpret a property's historic value (including the recreation of missing components in a historic district or site); when no other property with the same associative value has survived; and when sufficient historical documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction, reconstruction may be considered as a treatment. 
3.  Building orientation and site-placement: 
Requirements: 
New buildings will respect the placement of nearby historic buildings by being placed at a setback equal to that of nearby similar historic buildings or similar buildings within the district. It is required to align new buildings with the established setbacks of the area. Nontraditional lots can be given special consideration by the HPC. 
Buildings with party walls, such as those along Wall Street, Main Street, Public Square, and East Church Street (under the bridge) shall maintain zero lot line placement. New buildings on these streets will not have side setbacks, leaving gaps between adjacent buildings, but will use party walls. 
4.  Entrance orientation: 
Requirement: 
New construction will face the same street as nearby similar buildings. Respect traditional designs used for building entrances of similar buildings in the district, using, for example, a recessed entrance where appropriate. 
5.  Windows: 
Requirement: 
The size and proportion of window and door openings of a building should be similar to those on surrounding exemplary facades. The same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole. Maintain the rhythm of the surrounding windows. 
6.  Materials: 
Requirement: 
Use building materials that are similar to those employed historically for all major surfaces. Brick, stone and terra cotta may be used in unlimited quantities. 
Wood may be used on the first story (store-front level) for architectural elements such as pilasters, cornices, decorative raised panels, etc., but wood should not be used as a general siding material. 
Concrete block may be used in combination with other materials such as brick or stone. Concrete and precast concrete use is limited to architectural elements such as window hoods, cornices, columns and capitals. Glazed block or ceramic tile may be used as accent material only. 
Prohibited materials on building facades include metal, aluminum, or vinyl siding and preformed panels; porcelain or baked enamel metal panels; asphalt or wood shingles or siding. New materials may be used if their appearances are similar to those of the historic building materials. 
7.  Plant beds and plantings: 
Requirement: 
Landscaping plans shall be approved by the DDA design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the COA to the historic preservation commission (HPC). 
Recommendation: 
The goal is to beautify the district and make it more pleasant for pedestrian traffic. Locate plantings in traditional areas of the site, such as along fences, walks, and foundations. Well-maintained concrete planters that harmonize with nearby buildings and existing streetscape are recommended. 
8.  Walls and fences: 
Requirement: 
The goal is to maintain the pattern of existing fencing in the Historic Downtown Business District and to use fencing and walls to screen parking and storage areas. Maintain traditional fence lines or dominant fence lines in the vicinity. New fence and wall designs must be appropriate for the primary structure and reinforce the pedestrian scale instead of forming barriers or exclusionary walls. 
Any fencing shall be approved by the DDA design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the COA to the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC). 
Privacy fences should not be placed flush with the facade of a building. 
Recommendation: 
New fences should limit their impact by being placed behind the rear elevation and by using traditional materials, usually wood. Any obtrusive fence shall be further screened from public view by evergreen vegetation or a second traditional fence. 
9.  Pavement: 
Requirement: 
Historic walks and drives should be repaired rather than replaced. If replacement is required, new materials should match the original in placement, composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. 
10.  Parking lots: 
Requirement: 
Where placement of parking area is an option, parking lots should not be the main focus of the site. Side or rear locations are required. Plan parking lots to be subdivided into small components so that the visual impact of large paved areas is reduced. Include islands of plantings in the interior of lots, and provide planting buffers at the edges of parking lots. 
New screening walls shall be used to limit the impact of parking on the district by being of sufficient height to partially screen the parked vehicles. The facade line of nearby historic buildings should be maintained. Traditional materials. usually brick, should be used. Nontraditional materials cannot be used for fences in public view. (See also Walls and Fences.) 
11.  Service areas and equipment: 
Requirement: 
Screen service equipment and trash containers from public view. The visual impact of mechanical and electrical equipment shall be minimized. (See also walls and fences.) 
12.  Signs: 
Requirement: 
Signs shall be subordinate to the architecture and overall character throughout the district. Sign materials shall be compatible with the building materials. The types and sizes of signs allowed are defined in the sign ordinance of the City of Cartersville. 
Position flush-mounted signs so they will fit within architectural features. Locate flush signs so they do not extend beyond the outer edges of the building front. Avoid obscuring ornament and detail. 
Locate projecting signs along the first floor level of the facade. Positions near the building's entrance are encouraged. Locate pole-mounted signs in landscaped areas. 
Where several businesses share a building, coordinate the signs. Align several smaller signs, or group them onto a single panel. Use similar forms or backgrounds for the signs to visually tie them together. 
13.  Additions: 
Requirement: 
New additions should not obscure or confuse the essential form and character of the original building. Exteriors of additions to existing buildings should be compatible with the size, scale, material, and character of the main building and its environment. 
Avoid new additions that would hinder the ability to interpret the design character of the historic period of the district. Site additions back from the building front so they will not alter the historic rhythm of building fronts. 
When locating additions to historic buildings, maintain the pattern created by the repetition of building fronts in the area. Locate additions so they will not obscure or damage significant ornamentation or detail. Avoid impacts to special moldings, decorative windows, or dormers. Generally, additions should be sited to the side or rear of the original structure. 
14.  Demolition: 
Requirement: 
Before demolition, submit a site plan to the commission illustrating proposed site development or plantings to follow demolition. 
During demolition, ensure the safety of any adjacent properties and historic resources. Also, during and after demolition, protect the trees on the site from damage due to compaction of the soil by equipment or materials. 
After demolition, clear the site promptly and thoroughly.

(d)  Design guidelines. The following design guidelines are adopted for the Olde Towne Historic District: 
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR STRUCTURES 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
    These guidelines are intended to identify the characteristic features of the designation to be used in determining the compatibility of new construction or alteration of size, location, materials, style, rhythm, and any other quality deemed by the Cartersville Historic Preservation Commission to contribute to the character of a historic property. 
    In filing for a certificate of appropriateness all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application. Recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in your application for a certificate of appropriateness. Maintenance recommendations are included for informational purposes only and are not to be included in an application for a certificate of appropriateness, and as such shall not be considered by the commission in reviewing said applications. 
Requirements: 
1.  It is not appropriate to introduce contemporary equipment to include satellite dishes, solar collectors, playground equipment, heating and air units, storage units, swimming pools in locations that compromise the historic character of the building site. Locate such features unobtrusively, and screen them from view. 
2.  When planning to alter the topography of a site substantially through grading, filling, or excavation, it is necessary to check with the Cartersville Planning and Development Department to make sure that changes comply with the city building code. 
3.  When remodeling historic structures or constructing new structures in historic districts, it is urged that care be taken in retaining and preserving the historic relationship between buildings and designated historically related features of the district, to include but not limited to, site topography, retaining wall, foundation plantings, hedges, walkways, driveways, car parks, trees, gardens, yards, arbors, ground cover, fences, accessory buildings, patios, terraces, and significant vistas and views. 
PART ONE 
MAINTAINING, REPAIRING, REPLACING STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO A HISTORIC DISTRICT. 
A.  Wood: 
Requirements: 
1.  Repair historic wooden features using the recognized preservation methods for patching, consolidating, splicing, and reinforcing. 
2.  If replacement of a deteriorated detail or element of a wooden feature is necessary, replace only the deteriorated detail or element in kind rather than the entire feature. Match the original detail or element in design, dimension, texture, and material. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original material is not feasible. 
3.  If replacement of an entire wooden feature is necessary, replace it in kind, matching the original in design, dimension, detail, and texture. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original material is not feasible. 
4.  If a wooden feature is completely missing, replace it with a new feature based on accurate documentation of the original feature or a new design compatible in scale, size, material, and texture with the historic building and district. 
5.  It is not appropriate to clean wooden features and surfaces with destructive methods such as sandblasting, power washing, and using propane or butane torches. Clean using gentle methods such as low-pressure washing with detergents and natural bristle brushes. Chemical strippers can be used only if gentler methods are ineffective. 
6.  It is not appropriate to strip historically painted surfaces down to bare wood and apply clean stains or finishes to create a natural wood appearance. 
7.  It is not appropriate to replace painted wooden siding that is sound with new siding to achieve a uniformly smooth wooden surface. 
8.  It is not appropriate to replace or cover wooden siding, trim, or window sashes with contemporary substitute materials such as aluminum, masonite or vinyl. However, in order to maintain continuity, material for additions, as well as out buildings, should closely match the house. 
9.  It is not appropriate to introduce wooden features or details to a historic building in an attempt to create a false historic appearance. 
10.  Preserve wooden features that contribute to the overall historic character of a building and site, including such functional and decorative elements as siding, shingles, cornices, architrave, brackets, pediments, columns, balustrades, and architectural trim. 
11.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of appropriateness, the following guidelines must be observed. 
a.  When retaining and cleaning painted surfaces, it is required that the gentlest means possible be used. It is further required that historic structures be painted only when the paint film is damaged or deteriorated. 
b.  Protect and maintain wooden surfaces and features through appropriate methods. Inspect for and repair signs of moisture damage, mildew, and fungal or insect infestation. Keep wooden joints properly sealed or caulked to prevent moisture infiltration. 
c.  Treat traditionally unpainted, exposed wooden features with chemical preservatives to prevent or slow their decay and deterioration. 
d.  Retain protective surface coatings, such as paint, to prevent damage from ultraviolet light and moisture.

3.  If replacement of a deteriorated window or door feature or detail is necessary, replace only the deteriorated feature in kind rather than the entire unit. Match the original in design, dimension, and material. Consider compatible substitute material only if using the original material is not technically feasible. 
4.  If replacement of a deteriorated window or door unit is necessary, replace the unit in kind, matching the design and dimension of the original sash or panels, pane configuration, architectural trim, detailing, and materials. Consider compatible substitute material only if using the original material is not technically feasible. 
5.  If a window or a door is completely missing, replace it with a new unit based on accurate documentation of the original or a new design compatible with the original opening and the historic character of the building. 
6.  Replace deteriorated or missing wooden shutters with historically appropriate wooden shutters sized to fit the opening. It is not appropriate to introduce shutters on a historic building if no evidence of earlier shutters exists. 
7.  If additional windows and doors are necessary for a new use, install them on a rear or non-character-defining facade of the building, but only if they do not compromise the architectural integrity of the building. Design such units to be compatible with the overall design of the building, but not to duplicate the original. 
8.  It is not appropriate to remove original doors, windows, shutters, blinds, hardware, and trim from a character-defining facade. 
9.  It is not appropriate to remove any detail material associated with windows and doors, such as stained glass, beveled glass, textured glass, or tracery, unless an accurate restoration requires it. 
10.  It is not appropriate to use snap-in muntins to create false divided-light appearance. 
11.  It is not appropriate to replace clear glazing with tinted or opaque glazing. 
12.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of appropriateness, the following guidelines must be observed: 
a.  Protect and maintain the wood and metal elements of historic windows and doors through appropriate methods: 
1.  Inspect regularly for deterioration, moisture damage, air infiltration, paint failure, and corrosion. 
2.  Clean the surface using the gentlest means possible. 
3.  Limit paint removal and reapply protective coatings as necessary. 
4.  Reglaze sash as necessary to prevent moisture infiltration. 
5.  Weather-strip windows and doors to reduce air infiltration and increase energy efficiency. 
b.  Repair historic windows and doors and their distinctive features through recognized preservation methods for patching, consolidating, splicing, and reinforcing. 
c.  If desired, introduce narrow-profile exterior or interior storm windows so that they do not obscure or damage the existing sash and frame. Select exterior storm windows with a painted or baked-enamel finish color that is compatible with the sash color. For double-hung windows, operable storm window dividers should align with the existing meeting rail. 
d.  If desired, introduce full-light storm doors constructed of wood or aluminum that do not obscure or damage the existing door and frame. Select storm doors with a painted, stained, or baked-enamel finish color that is compatible with the color of the existing door. Bare aluminum storm doors are not appropriate. 
e.  If desired and where historically appropriate, install fabric awnings over window, door or porch openings with care to ensure that historic features are not damaged or obscured. 
J.  Entrances, porches, and balconies: 
Requirements: 
1.  Retain and preserve entrances, porches, and balconies that contribute to the overall historic character of a building, including such functional and decorative elements as columns, pilasters, piers, entablatures, balustrades, sidelights, fanlights, transoms, steps, railings, floors, and ceilings. 
2.  When repairing historic entrances, porches, and balconies and their distinctive features and materials use recognized preservation methods for patching, consolidating, splicing, and reinforcing. 
3.  If replacement of a deteriorated detail or element of an entrance, porch or balcony feature is necessary, replace only the deteriorated detail or element in kind rather than the entire feature. Match the original in design, dimension, and material. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original materials is not technical feasible. 
4.  If replacement of an entire entrance, porch or balcony feature is necessary because of deterioration, replace in kind, matching the original in design, dimension, detail, texture, and material. Consider compatible substitute materials if only using the original materials is not technically feasible. 
5.  If a feature or an entire entrance, porch or balcony is missing, replace it with a feature based on accurate documentation of the original or a new design compatible with the historic character of the building and the district. 
6.  Consider the enclosure of a historic porch to accommodate a new use only if the enclosure can be designed to preserve the historic character of the porch and the building. It is not appropriate to enclose a front porch or a front balcony. 
7.  It is not appropriate to remove any detail material associated with entrances and porches, such as graining, spindle-work, beveled glass, or beaded board, unless an accurate restoration requires it. 
8.  It is not appropriate to remove an original entrance or porch or to add a new entrance or porch on a primary facade. 
9.  It is not appropriate to introduce features or details to a historic entrance, porch or balcony in an attempt to create a false historical appearance. 
K.  Utilities and energy retrofit: 
Requirements: 
1.  Replace deteriorated or missing wooden blinds and shutters with matching new units sized to fit the opening and mounted so that they can be operated. 
2.  If a new mechanical system is needed, install it so that it causes the least amount of alteration to the building's exterior facades, historic building fabric, and site features. 
3.  Increase the thermal efficiency of historic buildings by observing appropriate traditional practices, such as weather stripping and caulking, and by introducing energy-efficient features, such as awnings, operable shutters, and storm windows and doors, where appropriate. 
4.  Retain and preserve the inherent energy-conserving features of historic buildings and their sites, including shade trees, porches, awnings, and operable windows, transoms, shutters, and blinds. 
5.  Where possible, locate portable window air-conditioning units on rear facades or inconspicuous side facades. 
6.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of appropriateness, the following guidelines must be observed: 
a.  If desired, introduce narrow-profile exterior or interior storm windows so that they do not obscure or damage the existing sash and frame. Select exterior storm windows with a painted or baked-enamel finish color that is compatible with the sash color. For double-hung windows, operable storm window dividers should align with existing meeting rails. 
b.  If desired, introduce full-light storm doors constructed of wood or aluminum that do not obscure or damage the existing door or frame. Select storm doors with a painted, stained, or baked-enamel finished color that is compatible with the color of the existing door. Bare aluminum storm doors and storm windows are not appropriate. 
c.  If desired and where historically appropriate, install fabric awnings over window, door or porch openings with care to ensure that historic features are not damaged or obscured. 
d.  In general, the introduction of underground utility lines to reduce the intrusion of additional overhead lines and poles is encouraged. However, in trenching, take care to avoid archaeological resources and the roots of trees. 
L.  Accessibility, health, and safety considerations: 
Requirements: 
1.  In considering changes to a historic building, review accessibility and life safety code implications to determine if the proposed change is compatible with the building's historic character and setting or will compromise them. 
2.  Meet accessibility and life-safety building code requirements in such a way that the historic building's character-defining facades, features, and finishes are preserved. 
3.  Determine appropriate solutions to accessibility with input from historic preservation specialists and local disability groups. 
4.  If needed, introduce new or additional means of access that are reversible and that do not compromise the original design of a historic entrance or porch. 
5.  Work with code officials in exploring alternative methods of equal or superior effectiveness in meeting safety code requirements while preserving significant historic features. 
6.  Locate fire doors, exterior fire stairs, or elevator additions on rear of non character-defining facades. Design such elements to be compatible in character, materials, scale, proportion, and finish with the historic building. 
M.  Additions to historic buildings: 
Requirements: 
1.  Design an addition to be compatible with the historic building in mass, materials, and relationship of solids to windows and doors in the exterior walls, yet make the addition discernible from the original. 
2.  It is not appropriate to construct an addition if it will detract from the overall historic character of the principal building and the site, or if it will require the removal of a significant building element or site feature. 
3.  It is not appropriate to construct an addition that significantly changes the proportion of built mass to open space on the individual site. 
4.  Construct new additions so that there is the least possible loss of historic fabric and so that the character-defining features of the historic building are not destroyed, damaged, or obscured. 
5.  Design new additions so that the overall character of the site, site topography, character-defining site features, trees, and significant district vistas and view are retained. 
6.  Locate a new addition on an inconspicuous elevation of the historic building, usually the rear one. 
N.  Aesthetic recommendations: 
1.  Survey in advance and limit any disturbance to the site's terrain during construction to minimize the possibility of destroying unknown archaeological resources. 
2.  Protect large trees and other significant site features from immediate damage during construction and from delayed damage due to construction activities, such as loss of root area or compaction of the soil by equipment. It is especially critical to avoid compaction of the soil within the drip lines of trees. 
3.  Limit the size and scale of an addition in relationship to the historic building so that it does not diminish or visually overpower the building. 
PART TWO 
New construction: 
Requirements: 
1.  Site new construction must be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of orientation, and distance from adjacent buildings. 
2.  Design new construction so that the overall character of the site, site topography, character-defining site features, trees, and significant district vistas and views are retained. 
3.  Evaluate in advance and limit any disturbance to the site's terrain during construction to minimize the possibility of destroying unknown archaeological resources. 
4.  Design new buildings to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing, proportion, and roof shape. 
5.  Design the proportion of the proposed new building's front facade to be compatible with the front facade proportion of surrounding buildings. 
6.  Design the spacing, placement, scale, orientation, proportion, and size of window and door openings in proposed new construction to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district. 
7.  Select windows and doors for proposed new building that are compatible in material, subdivision, proportion, pattern, and detail with the windows and the doors of surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district. 
8.  Select materials and finishes for proposed new buildings that are compatible with historic materials and finishes found in surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district in terms of composition, scale, module, pattern, detail, texture, finish, color, and sheen. 
9.  Design new buildings so that they are compatible with but discernible from historic buildings in the district. 
Recommendations: 
1.  Protect large trees and other significant site features from immediate damage during construction and from delayed damage due to construction activities, such as loss of root area or compaction of the soil by equipment. It is especially critical to avoid compaction of the soil within the drip line of trees. 
PART THREE 
Relocation: 
Requirements: 
1.  Before moving a historic structure, document its original setting and context. Use photographs, site plans, or other graphic or written statements to record existing site conditions. 
2.  Enlist contractors experienced in moving historic buildings to do the following: 
a.  Determine the structural condition of the property before the move. 
b.  Coordinate the move with the utility companies and appropriate city departments. 
c.  Protect the structure from vandalism or weather damage before, during and after the move.

4.  Relocate a structure on a site within a historic district according to new construction guidelines for siting, orientation, plantings, and other pertinent aspects of site and setting. 
5.  Ensure that the relocation of a structure will not diminish or damage existing historic district buildings or the overall character of the district. Pay particular attention to the tree canopy along the route of the move. 
6.  Provide the HPC with site plan information for the proposed site features and plantings of the new setting, including information on accessory buildings, driveways, site lighting, and parking areas. 
7.  If the original site of the structure to be relocated is within a historic district, before the move, submit to the commission a site plan for proposed site features and plantings of the original site after the relocation. 
8.  Protect significant site features of the original site, the new site, and the route of the move during relocation. 
PART FOUR 
Demolition: 
Requirements: 
1.  Before demolition, submit a site plan to the commission illustrating proposed site development or plantings to follow demolition. 
2.  During demolition, ensure the safety of any adjacent properties and historic resources. Also, during and after demolition, protect the trees on the site from damage due to compaction of the soil by equipment or materials.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR 
STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE HISTORIC 
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
    These guidelines are intended to identify the characteristic features of the designation to be used in determining the compatibility of new construction or alteration of size, location, materials, style, rhythm, and any other quality deemed by the Cartersville Historic Preservation Commission to contribute to the character of a historic property. 
    In filing for a certificate of preservation all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application. Recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in your application for a certificate of preservation. Maintenance recommendations are included for informational purposes only and are not to be included in an application for a certificate of preservation, and as such shall not be considered by the commission in reviewing said applications. 
Requirements: 
1.  It is not appropriate to introduce contemporary equipment to include satellite dishes, solar collectors, playground equipment, heating and air units, storage units, swimming pools in locations that compromise the historic character of the building site. Locate such features unobtrusively, and screen them from view. 
2.  When planning to alter the topography of a site substantially through grading, filling, or excavation, it is necessary to check with the Cartersville Planning and Development Department to make sure that changes comply with the city building code. 
3.  When remodeling historic structures or constructing new structures in historic districts, it is urged that care be taken in retaining and preserving the historic relationship between buildings and designated historically related features of the district, to include but not limited to, site topography, retaining wall, foundation plantings, hedges, walkways, driveways, car parks, trees, gardens, yards, arbors, ground cover, fences, accessory buildings, patios, terraces, and significant vistas and views. 
PART ONE 
MAINTAINING, REPAIRING, REPLACING STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO A HISTORIC DISTRICT 
A.  Wood: 
Requirements: 
1.  Repair historic wooden features using the recognized preservation methods for patching, consolidating, splicing, and reinforcing. 
2.  If replacement of a deteriorated detail or element of a wooden feature is necessary, replace only the deteriorated detail or element in kind rather than the entire feature. Match the original detail or element in design, dimension, texture, and material. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original material is not feasible. 
3.  If replacement of an entire wooden feature is necessary, replace it in kind, matching the original in design, dimension, detail, and texture. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original material is not feasible. 
4.  If a wooden feature is completely missing, replace it with a new feature based on accurate documentation of the original feature or a new design compatible in scale, size, material, and texture with the historic building and district. 
5.  It is not appropriate to clean wooden features and surfaces with destructive methods such as sandblasting, power washing, and using propane or butane torches. Clean using gentle methods such as low-pressure washing with detergents and natural bristle brushes. Chemical strippers can be used only if gentler methods are ineffective. 
6.  It is not appropriate to strip historically painted surfaces down to bare wood and apply clean stains or finishes to create a natural wood appearance. 
7.  It is not appropriate to replace painted wooden siding that is sound with new siding to achieve a uniformly smooth wooden surface. 
8.  It is not appropriate to replace or cover wooden siding, trim, or window sashes with contemporary substitute materials such as aluminum, masonite or vinyl. However, in order to maintain continuity, material for additions, as well as out buildings, should closely match the house. 
9.  It is not appropriate to introduce wooden features or details to a historic building in an attempt to create a false historic appearance. 
10.  Preserve wooden features that contribute to the overall historic character of a building and site, including such functional and decorative elements as siding, shingles, cornices, architrave, brackets, pediments, columns, balustrades, and architectural trim. 
11.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of appropriateness, the following guidelines must be observed. 
a.  When retaining and cleaning painted surfaces, it is required that the gentlest means possible be used. It is further required that historic structures be painted only when the paint film is damaged or deteriorated. 
b.  Protect and maintain wooden surfaces and features through appropriate methods. Inspect for and repair signs of moisture damage, mildew, and fungal or insect infestation. Keep wooden joints properly sealed or caulked to prevent moisture infiltration.

8.  It is not appropriate to remove an original entrance or porch or to add a new entrance or porch on a primary facade. 
9.  It is not appropriate to introduce features or details to a historic entrance, porch or balcony in an attempt to create a false historical appearance. 
K.  Utilities and energy retrofit: 
Requirements: 
1.  Replace deteriorated or missing wooden blinds and shutters with matching new units sized to fit the opening and mounted so that they can be operated. 
2.  If a new mechanical system is needed, install it so that it causes the least amount of alteration to the building's exterior facades, historic building fabric, and site features. 
3.  Increase the thermal efficiency of historic buildings by observing appropriate traditional practices, such as weather stripping and caulking, and by introducing energy-efficient features, such as awnings, operable shutters, and storm windows and doors, where appropriate. 
4.  Retain and preserve the inherent energy-conserving features of historic buildings and their sites, including shade trees, porches, awnings, and operable windows, transoms, shutters, and blinds. 
5.  Where possible, locate portable window air-conditioning units on rear facades or inconspicuous side facades. 
6.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of appropriateness, the following guidelines must be observed: 
a.  If desired, introduce narrow-profile exterior or interior storm windows so that they do not obscure or damage the existing sash and frame. Select exterior storm windows with a painted or baked-enamel finish color that is compatible with the sash color. For double-hung windows, operable storm window dividers should align with existing meeting rails. 
b.  If desired, introduce full-light storm doors constructed of wood or aluminum that do not obscure or damage the existing door or frame. Select storm doors with a painted, stained, or baked-enamel finished color that is compatible with the color of the existing door. Bare aluminum storm doors and storm windows are not appropriate. 
c.  If desired and where historically appropriate, install fabric awnings over window, door or porch openings with care to ensure that historic features are not damaged or obscured. 
d.  In general, the introduction of underground utility lines to reduce the intrusion of additional overhead lines and poles is encouraged. However, in trenching, take care to avoid archaeological resources and the roots of trees. 
L.  Accessibility, health, and safety considerations: 
Requirements: 
1.  In considering changes to a historic building, review accessibility and life safety code implications to determine if the proposed change is compatible with the building's historic character and setting or will compromise them. 
2.  Meet accessibility and life-safety building code requirements in such a way that the historic building's character-defining facades, features, and finishes are preserved. 
3.  Determine appropriate solutions to accessibility with input from historic preservation specialists and local disability groups. 
4.  If needed, introduce new or additional means of access that are reversible and that do not compromise the original design of a historic entrance or porch. 
5.  Work with code officials in exploring alternative methods of equal or superior effectiveness in meeting safety code requirements while preserving significant historic features. 
6.  Locate fire doors, exterior fire stairs, or elevator additions on rear of non character-defining facades. Design such elements to be compatible in character, materials, scale, proportion, and finish with the historic building. 
M.  Additions to historic buildings: 
Requirements: 
1.  Design an addition to be compatible with the historic building in mass, materials, and relationship of solids to windows and doors in the exterior walls, yet make the addition discernible from the original. 
2.  It is not appropriate to construct an addition if it will detract from the overall historic character of the principal building and the site, or if it will require the removal of a significant building element or site feature. 
3.  It is not appropriate to construct an addition that significantly changes the proportion of built mass to open space on the individual site. 
4.  Construct new additions so that there is the least possible loss of historic fabric and so that the character-defining features of the historic building are not destroyed, damaged, or obscured. 
5.  Design new additions so that the overall character of the site, site topography, character-defining site features, trees, and significant district vistas and view are retained. 
6.  Locate a new addition on an inconspicuous elevation of the historic building, usually the rear one. 
N.  Aesthetic recommendations: 
1.  Survey in advance and limit any disturbance to the site's terrain during construction to minimize the possibility of destroying unknown archaeological resources. 
2.  Protect large trees and other significant site features from immediate damage during construction and from delayed damage due to construction activities, such as loss of root area or compaction of the soil by equipment. It is especially critical to avoid compaction of the soil within the drip lines of trees. 
3.  Limit the size and scale of an addition in relationship to the historic building so that it does not diminish or visually overpower the building. 
PART TWO 
New construction: 
Requirements: 
1.  Site new construction must be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of orientation, and distance from adjacent buildings. 
2.  Design new construction so that the overall character of the site, site topography, character-defining site features, trees, and significant district vistas and views are retained. 
3.  Evaluate in advance and limit any disturbance to the site's terrain during construction to minimize the possibility of destroying unknown archaeological resources. 
4.  Design new buildings to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing, proportion, and roof shape. 
5.  Design the proportion of the proposed new building's front facade to be compatible with the front facade proportion of surrounding buildings. 
6.  Design the spacing, placement, scale, orientation, proportion, and size of window and door openings in proposed new construction to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district. 
7.  Select windows and doors for proposed new building that are compatible in material, subdivision, proportion, pattern, and detail with the windows and the doors of surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district. 
8.  Select materials and finishes for proposed new buildings that are compatible with historic materials and finishes found in surrounding buildings that contribute to the special character of the historic district in terms of composition, scale, module, pattern, detail, texture, finish, color, and sheen. 
9.  Design new buildings so that they are compatible with but discernible from historic buildings in the district. 
Recommendations: 
1.  Protect large trees and other significant site features from immediate damage during construction and from delayed damage due to construction activities, such as loss of root area or compaction of the soil by equipment. It is especially critical to avoid compaction of the soil within the drip line of trees. 
PART THREE 
Relocation: 
Requirements: 
1.  Before moving a historic structure, document its original setting and context. Use photographs, site plans, or other graphic or written statements to record existing site conditions. 
2.  Enlist contractors experienced in moving historic buildings to do the following: 
a.  Determine the structural condition of the property before the move. 
b.  Coordinate the move with the utility companies and appropriate city departments. 
c.  Protect the structure from vandalism or weather damage before, during and after the move. 
d.  Minimize structural damage during the move. 
3.  Relocate a structure within the historic district only if it is determined to be architecturally compatible with the adjacent buildings according to the guidelines for new construction. 
4.  Relocate a structure on a site within a historic district according to new construction guidelines for siting, orientation, plantings, and other pertinent aspects of site and setting. 
5.  Ensure that the relocation of a structure will not diminish or damage existing historic district buildings or the overall character of the district. Pay particular attention to the tree canopy along the route of the move. 
6.  Provide the HPC with site plan information for the proposed site features and plantings of the new setting, including information on accessory buildings, driveways, site lighting, and parking areas. 
7.  If the original site of the structure to be relocated is within a historic district, before the move, submit to the commission a site plan for proposed site features and plantings of the original site after the relocation. 
8.  Protect significant site features of the original site, the new site, and the route of the move during relocation. 
PART FOUR 
Demolition: 
Requirements: 
1.  Before demolition, submit a site plan to the commission illustrating proposed site development or plantings to follow demolition. 
2.  During demolition, ensure the safety of any adjacent properties and historic resources. Also, during and after demolition, protect the trees on the site from damage due to compaction of the soil by equipment or materials.

(c)  Overlay map. The zoning map of the City of Cartersville shall be amended to show the Cherokee-Cassville Historic District as an overlay on said zoning map and said overlay on said zoning map and said overlay shall be designated as the H-1C-C Historic District. 
(d)  Design guidelines. The following design guidelines are adopted for the Cherokee-Cassville Historic District: 
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO THE HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
    These guidelines are intended to identify the characteristic features of the designation to be used in determining the compatibility of new construction or alteration of size, location, materials, style, rhythm, and any other quality deemed by the Cartersville Historic Preservation Commission to contribute to the character of a historic property. 
    In filing for a certificate of preservation (COP) all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application. Recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in you application for a COP. 
    Requirements: 
1.  It is not appropriate to introduce contemporary equipment to include satellite dishes, solar collectors, playground equipment, heating and air units, storage units, swimming pools in locations that comprise the historic character of the building site. Locate such features unobtrusively, and screen them from view. 
2.  When planning to alter the topography of a site substantially through grading, filling, or excavation, it is necessary to check with the Cartersville Planning and Development Department to make sure the changes comply with the city building code. 
3.  When remodeling historic structures or constructing new structures in historic districts, it is urged that care be taken in retaining and preserving the historic relationship between buildings and designated historically related features of the district, to include but nor limited to, site topography, retaining wall, foundation plantings, hedges, walkways, driveways, car parks, trees, gardens, yards, arbors, ground cover, fences, accessory buildings, patios, terraces, and significant vistas and views. 
PART ONE 
MAINTAINING, REPAIRING, REPLACING STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO A HISTORIC DISTRICT 
A.  Wood. 
    Requirements: 
1.  Repair historic wooden features using the recognized preservation methods for patching, consolidation, splicing, and reinforcing. 
2.  If replacement of a deteriorating detail or element of a wooded feature is necessary replace only the deteriorated detail or element in kind rather than the entire feature. Match the original detail or element in design, dimension, texture, and material. Consider comparable substitute materials only if using the original material is not feasible. 
3.  If replacement of an entire wooden feature is necessary, replace is in kind matching the original in design, dimension, detail, and texture. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original materials is not feasible. 
4.  If a wooden feature is completely missing, replace it with a new feature based in accurate documentation of the original feature of a new design compatible in scale, size, material, and texture with the historic building district. 
5.  It is not appropriate to clean wooden features and surfaces with destructive methods such as sandblasting, power washing, and using propane or butane torches. Clean using gentle methods such as low pressure washing with detergents and natural bristle brushes. Chemical strippers can be used only if gentler methods are ineffective. 
6.  It is not appropriate to strip historically painted surfaces down to the bare wood and apply clean stains or finishes to create a natural wood appearance. 
7.  It is not appropriate to replace painted wooden siding that is sound with new siding to achieve a uniformly smooth wooded surface. 
8.  It is not appropriate to replace or cover wooden siding, trim, window sashes with contemporary substitute materials such as aluminum, masonite, or vinyl. 
9.  It is not appropriate to introduce wooden features or details to a historic building in attempt to created a false historic appearance. 
10.  Preserve wooden features that contribute to the overall historic character of a building and site, including such functional and decorative elements as siding, shingles, cornices, architrave, brackets, pediments, columns, balustrades, and architectural trim. 
11.  During rehabilitation and/or repair which requires a certificate of preservation, the following guidelines must be observed: 
a.  When retaining and cleaning painted surfaces, it is required that the gentlest means possible be used. It is further required that historic structures be painted only when the paint film is damaged or deteriorated. 
b.  Protect and maintain wooden surfaces and features through appropriate methods. Inspect for and repair signs of moisture damage, mildew, and fungal or insect infestation. Keep wooded joints properly sealed or caulked to prevent moisture infiltration. 
c.  Treat traditionally unpainted, exposed, wooden features with chemical preservatives to prevent or slow their decay and deterioration. 
d.  Retain protective surface coatings, such as paint, to prevent damage from ultraviolet light and moisture. 
B.  Masonry. 
    Requirements: 
1.  Retain and preserve masonry features that contribute to the overall historic character of the a building and a site, including walls, foundations, roofing materials, chimneys, cornices, quoins, steps, buttresses, piers, columns, lintels, arches and sills. 
2.  Protect and maintain historic masonry materials, such as brick, terra cotta, limestone, granite, stucco, slate, concrete, cement block and clay tile, and their constructive features, including bond patterns, corbels, water tables, and unpainted surfaces. 
3.  Repair historic masonry surfaces and features using recognized preservation methods for piecing-in, consolidation, patching damaged or deteriorated masonry. It is not appropriate to apply a waterproof coating to exposed masonry rather than repair it. 
4.  Repoint masonry motor joints if the mortar joints if the mortar is cracked, crumbling, or missing or if damp walls, or if damaged plaster indicate moisture penetration. 
5.  Before repainting, carefully remove deteriorated mortar using hand tools. Replace the mortar with new mortar that duplicate the original is strength, color, texture, and composition. Match the original mortar joints in width and profile. 
6.  If replacement of a deteriorated detail, module, or element of a masonry feature or surface is necessary, replace only the deteriorated portion in kind rather than the entire surface or feature. Consider compatible substitute materials only if using the original material is not technically feasible. 
7.  If replacement of a large masonry surface or entire feature is necessary, replace it in kind, matching the substitute materials only if using the original material is not technically feasible.

Sec. 10-301. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighbors through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
(b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Floyd County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Cartersville, Georgia, the mayor and city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the city limits and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

Secs. 10-456-10-504. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIV. - MEDICAL, PHARMACY, PAIN MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 10-505. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Since the 1990's, the abuse of prescription opioids has risen dramatically, due in large part to the increase in the use of these analgesics to manage pain. Opioids are prescribed to alleviate pain ranging from moderate to severe, as described by the patient. These analgesics principally affect the nervous system, suppressing the signlas of pain sent to the brain; examples of these medications can include, but not be limited to, morphine, codeine, oxycodone (e.g., OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet), and related drugs. As opioids "block the perception of pain" they also have the affect of creating a state of euphoria, which may be heightened when abused. Side effects can include drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory constraint. 
(b)  Opioids are recognized as very effective when taken as prescribed for legitimate pruposes, post surgery, for example. As the National Institute on Drug Abuse states, "Many studies have shown that the properly managed, short-term medical use of opioid analgesic drugs is safe and rarely causes addiction - defined as the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs despite adverse consequences - or dependence, which occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug, and often results in withdrawal symptoms when that drug is reduced or stopped." Unfortunately, opioids taken long-term can create physical dependency in some patients, producing withdrawal symptoms when the medication is not taken. Cessation side effects can include bone pain, insomnia, and vomiting, to name a few. 
(c)  Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the rise in the diversion of legal prescription drugs has grown exponentially, due to increased security at the borders and ports. Amplified security has effectively reduced the supply of illegal drugs, traditional smuggled by the drug trade, necessitating the need to find alternative methods of supplying drugs to users; consequently, legal prescription drugs are now being diverted to illegal uses - "diversion." These diverted drugs are Schedule II, III and IV drugs, which principally include opioids as well as complementary drugs. 
(d)  In recent years, South Florida, including Miam-Dade, Broward, and Palm Counties, have witnessed tremendous growth in the number of "pain clinics" that have opened in addition to the rapid increase of the diversion of prescription drugs. Broward County has been termed "The Painkiller Capital of the Unites States," and "The Columbia for Pharmaceutically Diverted Drugs." Broward County had four (4) pain clinics in 2007, jumping to one hundred fifteen (115) by November 2009, of a total of one hundred seventy-six (176) such clinics in all of South Florida. The majority of these pain clinics are nothing more than pill mills, diverting these scheduled drugs to illegal uses. As "clinics" have multiplied, the deaths due to overdoses of prescription drug medications, specifically opioids, have skyrocketed. 
(e)  With Broward County on the forefront of this epidemic, a grand jury was empanelled to investigate, issuing a report on November 19, 2009, after hearing testimony from prescription drug abusers and their families, federal and state law enforcement officials, physicians, prosecutors, and many more stakeholders. The report provides valuable information regarding the current state of this epidemic as well as recommendations to curtail this rapidly growing public safety concern. 
(f)  As Broward County and other South Florida jurisdictions struggle to eliminate "pill mills", this outbreak of illicit pain clinics crossed into other states, notably Georgia and Texas. In fact, the Cobb County Prescription Drug Task Force reports that in 2007, 82.46 percent overdose deaths state-wide involved pharmaceuticals, going to 85.11 percent in 2008. Alprazolam, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone were found to constitute the top five (5) substances involved in all of these overdose deaths. Alprazolam, commonly known by the trade name Xanax, an anxiety medications, is often combined and distributed with opioids at illegal pain clinics. 
(g)  Illegal pain clinics commonly known as "pill mills" dispense large quantities of Schedule II, III and IV drugs for cash, with little examination of the patient conducted. Scheduled drugs are dispensed at these establishments or prescriptions are written to be filled at a legitimate pharmacy. Often, out of jurisdiction and out-of-state license plates are in the parking lots of these clinics, with individuals driving great distances to receive these "prescriptions." Pill mills often hire security guards to handle unruly patients and perhaps even scout for law enforcement. Individuals seeking these services will often fake an ailment, forging an MRI or providing falsified medical documentation to receive prescriptions. In turn, the physicians conduct lackadaisical examinations of these individuals, simply asking them "what they want" with regard to medication. 
(h)  The City of Cartersville City Council adopted a twelve-month moratorium on the issuance of occupational tax certificates to "pain management clinics" on April 21, 2011, to conduct the proper research and vetting to create a new ordinance and Municipal Code addressing "pill mills." After thorough research, the city council has prepared these provisions to eliminate this rapidly emerging epidemic, creating a new article in the Code of the City of Cartersville. 
(i)  Not all pain clinics are "pill mills," thus the challenge of regulating this epidemic is daunting. Pill mills could easily be found in establishments that provide physical therapy, chiropractics, or general medicine, through the "pain clinic" title is most commonly associated with such operation. Therefore, the city council finds that "pill mills," pose a current and real threat to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of Cartersville, and therefore make the following declarations: 
(1)  The "pill mill" has become a store front for the new illegal drug trade, as legitimate prescription medication is diverted for illicit purposes. 
(2)  "Pill mills" must be regulated and differentiated from legitimate healthcare providers, as they attempt to enter the Georgia market from Florida and other neighboring states which are beginning to adopt regulatory legislation. 
(3)  "Pill mills" are often owned, operated and staffed by unlicensed proprietors, with little or no medical training. 
(4)  "Pill mills" masquerade as legitimate pain management establishments or medical providers, but instead perform few, if any, medical examinations with often sparsely furnished offices and no typical medical equipment. 
(5)  "Pill mills" operate on a cash basis, usually not accepting checks, credit cards, or health insurance, creating an environment that poses a security threat in light of the clientele seeking these illicit services. 
(6)  Individuals seeking "pill mill" services often falsify symptoms or provide bogus documentation of an ailment to receive powerful Schedule II, III and IV drugs. Alternative methods of treatment, physical therapy, surgery, etc., are rarely ever proposed to a patient seeking services from a "pill mill". 
(7)  Individuals will often "shop" various "pill mills" receiving multiple prescriptions on the same day or during a short period of time, thereafter reselling the pills to generate a profit to fund their own addiction and purchase additional supplies. 
(8)  "Dealers" or groups of dealers often sponsor individuals who obtain Schedule II, III and IV drugs repeatedly over multiple "pill mills", during a short period of time. These large quantities may then be resold at a much higher value to fund the purchase of larger quantities as well as to continue the abuse of these powerful drugs by the individuals involved. 
(9)  Individuals seeking "pill mill" services will often be consuming these scheduled drugs as they search for the next pill mill. These individuals may be under the influence of one (1) or more of these powerful drugs or suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Pill mills can usually supply scheduled drugs on-site for individuals to consume immediately, as well. Both the influence of the scheduled drug as well as the debilitating withdrawal symptoms affecting a driver operating a motor vehicle in City of Cartersville while seeking a "pill mill" is of grave concern. 
(10)  Legitimate pain clinics should be owned, operated and staffed by licensed physicians, boarded in a pain management-related field recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialists.

ARTICLE IV. - SPEED TABLE ORDINANCE 

Sec. 12-101. - Purpose. 
    The objective of the City of Cartersville Speed Table Ordinance is to provide a process whereby residential street(s) may obtain speed tables on residential streets with a maximum posted speed limit of thirty (30) mph. Alternative traffic calming devices are available and may be considered separately or as part of this process. To qualify for the installation of speed tables, areas of affected streets must meet all requirements set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-102. - Definitions. 
(a)  85th percentile speed: An index of traffic speeds for a road segment used by transportation professionals for traffic analysis purposes. The 85th percentile speed is the speed at which eighty-five (85) percent of the motorists are driving at or below. 
(b)  Affected street(s): The actual street(s) proposed for speed table installation. Affected street property owners are the owners of the lots with any frontage, including side frontage, on the street(s) proposed for speed table installation. 
(c)  ADT: Stands for average daily traffic and is a unit of measure used by transportation professionals for traffic volume analysis. Average daily traffic for the purpose of this policy refers to the traffic in both directions on a particular street within a twenty-four-hour time period. 
(d)  City council: The mayor and city council. 
(e)  Contact person(s): The person(s) requesting in writing a study to determine if their particular residential streets(s) qualifies for the installation of speed tables. 
(f)  Resident: The owner of property on a residential subdivisions streets(s), or if the property owner of a rental property is not able to be contacted, the tenant of the rental property. 
(g)  Residential street: A section of city street(s) being considered for speed table installation that is bordered along the entirety of both sides by properties used for residential purposes with the exception of properties adjacent to significant cross streets or having no constructed vehicular access to the studied street. 
(h)  Speed table: A vertical type traffic-calming device designed to reduce motorist's speeds to the posted speed limit. 
(i)  Traffic calming: A term used by transportation professionals to refer to reducing traffic speeds. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-103. - Requirements for study. 
(a)  The following criteria must be met before a particular residential street(s) is studied for possible speed table installation: 
(1)  Local, residential street. The City of Cartersville must confirm that the requested streets are classified as local, residential streets with a maximum posted speed limit of thirty (30) mph, or below. In addition, the requested street(s) must be suitable for speed table installation: streets must be a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet in length, and at least one thousand (1,000) feet of each street must have grades ten (10) percent or less and horizontal curves less severe than a radius of three hundred (300) feet. 
(2)  A request (in writing). The City of Cartersville must receive a written request from a resident (or residents) of a particular residential street(s) asking that their street(s) be studied to determine if any qualify for the installation of speed tables. The address of the resident making such request will be verified using the same procedures used for rezoning requests. 
(b)  Residential streets meeting the above criteria are added to the City of Cartersville list as a speed table study area for study purposes. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-104. - Validate speed and volume requirements. 
    Upon authorization by city council, a speed table request will be evaluated based upon the following study criteria. The following requirements have been established in determining if streets qualify for study regarding the possible installation of speed tables: 
Traffic data will be collected from selected residential street to determine the 85th percentile speed and the ADT. If the 85th percentile speed is ten (10) mph or more over the posted speed limit, and the ADT is between three hundred (300) and three thousand (3,000) vehicles, the residential street qualifies for a public meeting. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-105. - Public meeting. 
(a)  For all study areas that meet the previous requirements, a public meeting shall be held at which a representative of the public works department shall be present and take minutes for presentation to city council. Public meetings are held in order to provide speed table study area residents with relevant information prior to city council public hearings/readings. 
(b)  Prior to public meetings, public works shall mark the proposed speed table location(s) on the residential street(s) within three (3) feet of the final location(s) and shall subsequently verify that the resident(s) of property fronting the speed table location(s) agree with the proposed location(s). In the event that no suitable speed table location(s) can be agreed upon by public works and the resident(s) fronting the location(s), the matter will be brought forward to council for consideration prior to further action. 
(c)  Notices of the public meetings will be posted a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to each meeting. Signs advertising the public meeting(s) will be provided and installed by the City of Cartersville Public Works Department. Signs will be clearly legible to traffic traveling in each direction near each end of the road section being considered for speed tables. Public meetings consist of a short presentation, followed by a question and comment session. The purpose of the public meeting is to provide reasonable accommodation for input from residents and others that may use the residential street(s) to access their lots. 
(d)  Emergency service providers (police, fire and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-106. - Public hearing before city council. 
(a)  A public hearing shall be held to determine whether speed tables shall be installed on a residential street. Notice of public hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. Public hearings before the council will be conducted only for those locations that qualify for consideration under this policy. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study. Said approval shall be handled as an ordinance amendment. 
(b)  Emergency service providers (police, fire and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-107. - Speed table design standards. 
    The geometric design of speed tables is a crucial factor in their effectiveness. City of Cartersville speed tables will be constructed per the following specifications: 
(1)  Vertical height. Three (3) inches. A tolerance for minor height differences due to construction variations may be permitted. 
(2)  Horizontal length. Twenty-two (22) feet (consisting of an incline of six (6) feet; a plateau of ten (10) feet in length; and a decline of six (6) feet). 
(3)  Spacing/placement. In order to be effective, speed tables are typically installed in a series. Spacing between tables will vary between a minimum spacing of three hundred (300) feet and a maximum spacing of eight hundred (800) feet or as recommended by public works. Minor changes in the proposed speed table location up to three (3) feet may be considering prior to installation of the speed tables based upon resident concerns and the engineering feasibility to make such modifications. 
(4)  Signs/pavement markings. Speed tables will be identified in accordance with signing and pavement marking standards in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. In cases where special safety circumstances exist, public works may authorize signing and pavement marking exceeding the minimum standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-108. - Installation of speed tables. 
    The property owners requesting the permanent traffic control devices will be responsible for the costs of the measures. Installation of speed tables will be performed by either a private contractor, contracted by the City of Cartersville, or by city forces. Installation of speed tables will not be considered final until the City of Cartersville Public Works Department inspects the tables for compliance with design standards set forth in this article. Under certain circumstances or extreme hardships, the cost may be funded by the city if funds are available. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-109. - Repeated requests. 
    In the case where a request fails because of failing to meet the required criteria or lack of affirmative vote by city, that street(s) must wait a minimum of two (2) years from the start date of the original request in order to make a subsequent request, unless special circumstances have had a noticeable effect on the study criteria outlined in this policy. Repeat requests must be in writing and meet the same requirements detailed in this article for original requests. The process will be identical to a new request and will begin with the initial phases outlined in this article. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-110. - Removal process. 
(a)  Written request(s) for removal of a speed table can only be made after the speed table has been installed for a minimum of four (4) years. In the event that a resident(s) of a particular residential street asks that speed tables be removed from the street, such request must be made in writing to the City of Cartersville Public Works Department. It shall be verified that the request is from a resident(s) who lives on the residential street(s), as verified by the same process used for rezoning requests. Once the requestor has been verified as a resident of the affected street(s), a notice of public hearing shall be posted. Notice of public hearing may follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove removal of speed tables in the study using the procedure provided for to approve amendments to ordinances. 
(b)  Speed tables will not be removed unless approved by the city council. City of Cartersville reserves the right to remove speed tables for any reason. 
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14) 
Sec. 12-111. - Variance procedure. 
(a)  The city council, at its sole discretion, may vary from the procedure or standards set forth herein for any reason. 
(b)  Additionally, a resident of an affected street may request, in writing, that the city council grant a variance from the procedures or standards set forth in sections 12-101-12-107 of this article. Once a written variance request is filed with the city, the city shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the variance should be granted. Notice of variance hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the variance hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study at its sole discretion, following the procedure for amendments to ordinances.

Board members must recognize that their job is to advise in determining goals and policies, not to administer them. They do not use their position for political, financial, or personal advantage. They recognize their trusteeship and devote their time needed to learn their job and to carry out their responsibilities. They do not assume the functions of the director by attempting to dictate how details shall be carried out, by interfering with employment procedures, or by dealing directly in an executive capacity with subordinate workers.

(2)  No committee or individual board member has any authority unless such authority is specifically granted to him/her by the city council. 
(3)  Board members shall deal officially with the recreation staff only through the director. 
(4)  The board must be careful not to permit their judgment to be influenced by pressures adverse to the best interests of the parks and recreation department and all citizens of Cartersville. They must always bear in mind that all parks and recreation facilities and programs are to be utilized for and in the best interest of the entire citizenry and not for a select group. 
(5)  Board members are guides and counselors. They study the broader phases of operation leaving to the director all administrative details. They should, whenever possible, avail themselves to the director when requested to give counsel or advice in problems concerning the department. 
(6)  Board members should always insist upon the maintenance of the highest standards. 
(7)  Board members should, when requested to do so, be willing to represent and speak for the department at official occasions. Members are often called upon to act as spokesmen for departments in other cities at public ceremonies, public hearings on problems concerning the department, and conferences at which recreation programs and policies are under discussion. 
(8)  The board will be able to make changes, add to or delete from the by-laws and rules and regulations of the advisory board of the parks and recreation department. Any changes must by approved by the city council.

(1)  Whenever such a participant not covered by Social Security files an application for a disability retirement pension with the pension board, the participant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed practicing physician of Georgia certifying to the disability of such participant. Promptly thereafter the pension board shall order the participant to be examined by a physician to be named by the board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or disability of the participant. The pension board shall pay for the fees and expenses of such physician. In the event the certificates of the respective physicians generally agree upon disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical condition of the participant and the pension board shall grant a disability retirement pension in accordance with Section 4.4 of the Plan Document for the City of Cartersville Pension Plan. In the event the certificates of the aforesaid physicians disagree as to whether the participant is disabled, then under these circumstances that question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by the pension board. The medical opinion of the third physician, after examination of the participant and consultation with the other two (2) physicians, shall decide such question. The participant and the pension board shall share the fees and expenses of the third physician equally. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no participant shall qualify for a disability retirement pension if the pension board determines that the participant's disability results from (i) self-addiction to alcohol or narcotics, (ii) an injury suffered while engaged in a felonious or criminal act or enterprise or (iii) service in the Armed Forces of the United States which entitles the participant to a veteran's disability pension; but this provision shall not prevent the participant from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan.

In the event such participant receiving a disability retirement pension refuses to submit to a physical examination after thirty (30) days notice to report for such examination or to supply proof, of continuing disability, the pension board shall discontinue payments of the disability retirement pension until the participant submits to such examination or supplies such proof, and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited their pension during the time of refusal. Following certification that a participant's disability has ceased, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Such participant shall not be prevented from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan based only upon their vesting service, benefit accrual service and compensation prior to their disability retirement; and 
(2)  Any such participant shall not receive vested service or benefit accrual service for their period of disability and any pension payments received during their disability period shall be disregarded. 
(c)  Workers' compensation benefits: Further notwithstanding any other provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan, if at the time of retirement a participant is receiving payments under the provisions of the Georgia Workers' Compensation Law which are being paid at the expense of the city, the amount of pension payable under the plan shall be reduced by the amount being received as workers' compensation. This reduction shall continue as long as the retired participant is receiving workers' compensation, and upon discontinuance of workers' compensation payments, the offset shall be eliminated and the retired participant shall be entitled to receive sums as calculated under the terms of the pension plan. No such reduction shall operate to reduce the sums payable under the provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan below two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month. 
(d)  The cost of providing a disability retirement option shall be paid by the city, in lieu of providing long-term disability insurance coverage for employees vested in the pension plan.

Sec. 17-62. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the installation of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The reasons for requiring trees on a site and in parking lots are to provide shade, reduce temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce air and water pollution. 
    The following regulations seek to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community and to enhance the city's environmental and visual character for its citizens' use and enjoyment by the following means: 
(1)  Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment such as improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation. 
(2)  Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by itself a valuable capital asset. 
(3)  Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development. 
(4)  Preserve existing natural vegetation where possible and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape design.

    Procedures for appeal of any decision or interpretation of this article by the zoning enforcement officer shall be as stated in the Cartersville Zoning Ordinance.

For a variance to be granted from this article, each of the following must be shown: 
(1)  No characteristics contrary to the public interest will be promoted. No resulting variance shall create an effect or condition contrary to the public safety and welfare. Relief shall not impair the purposes of this article. 
(2)  A unique hardship exists because of an extraordinary and exceptional condition(s) pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of a characteristic of its size, shape, topography or like characteristic. In the absence of the factors listed in the preceding sentence, economic or financial hardship alone may not be sufficient to support the grant of a variance. 
(3)  The condition causing the hardship is unique and is not common to the region in general. 
    Request for variances regarding any part of this article or enforcement thereof shall specifically include reasons why the application should be granted. 
    Decisions of the board of zoning appeals shall be final, subject to such legal remedies an aggrieved party may have. Any appeal from a decision of the board of zoning appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days of the decision.

ARTICLE II. - SIGN ORDINANCE 

Sec. 20-17. - Findings and purposes. 
(a)  Purposes. This article was enacted with the following purposes: 
(1)  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
(2)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
(3)  To promote economic development; 
(4)  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
(5)  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city and to ensure the harmony and compatibility of the character of the area including its physical appearance, natural setting, informal landscaping, and preserve the historic character of the city; 
(6)  To encourage and ensure that development that is context-sensitive in design and materials compliments and is compatible and sensitive with the existing character of the area through its proportion, scale, design, style, placement, position, and architectural qualities that further the distinct values of the city; 
(7)  To protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
(8)  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; 
(9)  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
(10)  To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
(b)  Findings. This article was enacted with the following findings in mind: 
(1)  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
(2)  The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
(3)  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
(4)  The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

Sec. 20-32. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Signs lawfully existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming "grandfathered" signs and may remain, except as otherwise specifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced or altered in any manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall this provision have the effect of permitting the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good repair a nonconforming sign. No repairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep of nonconforming signs shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. A nonconforming sign which has been declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not be repaired, rebuilt or restored unless such repair or restoration will result in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this article. 
(c)  A nonconforming sign shall not be moved for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article. 
(d)  If a nonconforming sign is removed or discontinued for any period of time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(e)  A nonconforming sign which is changed to or replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(f)  Policy statement. As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or toppled by an act of God, weather, or whatever other means, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason for grant of a variance to re-erect the nonconforming sign.

In the event that any provision of this article regulates the same activity, conduct or any aspect of signage that is also regulated by city, state or federal law, then the provision most restrictive of signage shall govern. In the event that any provision of this article is in genuine conflict with any state or federal law or requirement, the conflict shall be resolved in accordance with law. 
(b)  Interpretation. The words used in this article in the present tense shall include the future. Singular words include the plural, and plural words include the singular.

Sec. 20-47. - Cases, sources and studies considered. 
    In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and city council recognize the vast number of court decisions, coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: 
  City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); 
  Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed.Appx. 900 (C.A.11 th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); 
  Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); 
  H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); 
  Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11 th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); 
  Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); 
  Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); 
  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); 
  St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); 
  Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste under 40 CFR 26 1, EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user; an identification of the constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed conditions must be submitted under section 24-112 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-108, 24-110, and 24-111 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d), 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

    The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 24-128 and 24-129 [of] this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
Sec. 24-127. - Show cause hearing. 
    The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-128. - Compliance orders. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, device or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established or pretreatment standard or requirement, not does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-129. - Cease and desist orders. 
(a)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-130. - Administrative fines. 
(a)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after fifteen (15) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of fifteen (15) percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-131. - Emergency suspensions. 
(a)  The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings [under] section 24-132 are initiated against the users. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-127 and 24-132 of this article. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-132. - Termination of discharge. 
    In addition to the provisions in section 24-105 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-127 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the superintendent shall not be a bar to, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
DIVISION 11. - JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 

Sec. 24-133. - Injunctive relief. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the municipal court through the city's attorney for the issuance of temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate. Said temporary or permanent injunction shall restrain or compel the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation.

    The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum to exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-138. - Liability insurance. 
    The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-139. - Water supply severance. 
    Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
Sec. 24-140. - Public nuisances. 
    Violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-141. - Contractor listing.

(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
DIVISION 13. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 24-142. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-143. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 24-83(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in section 24-83(b)(3) through (18), excluding subsection (b)(8), of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
Sec. 24-144. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
DIVISION 14. - WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES 

Sec. 24-145. - Generally. 
(a)  A permit from the city shall be obtained before a sewer tap is made, and such permit shall indicate that the prescribed fee has been made. 
(b)  Any unauthorized person making a tap shall be punished upon conviction of an offense. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the installation of sewer lines by assessments of abutting property that have been duly petitioned, advertised and approved by the council and in the same manner as assessments are made for paving streets. 
(d)  Cut on and cut-off service charges for water and gas utilities inside and outside the city shall be fixed by the council. Meters shall be read when service is cut on. If service is restored for the same customer, any service used during the off period will be billed at twice the applicable rate as a penalty. 
(e)  Nonwater customers and those obtaining water from wells using the city sewer system are required to meter well pumpage and shall be charged the regular sewer service fees. The property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department. 
(f)  Fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) may or may not be punitive as deemed by the city. 
(g)  Fines for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) can be waived, provided no harm occurred to the POTW, at the discretion of the city on a case-by-case basis. 
(h)  Wastewater discharges between three hundred (300) mg/l and six hundred (600) mg/l of BOD and/or TSS will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding six hundred (600) mg/l. The purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the POTW to handle excess BOD and/or TSS, and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost. 
(1)  For samples with a difficult BOD to measure accurately, chemical oxygen demand (COD) may be substituted for BOD analysis. Wastewater discharges between seven hundred fifty (750) and two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/l of COD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/l.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 12-08, adopted Apr. 3, 2008, repealed the former § 24-147, and enacted a new § 24-147 as set out herein. The former § 24-147 pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 
Sec. 24-148. - Low pressure systems. 
(1)  Preamble: 
    WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and greater costs for homeowners; and 
    WHEREAS, the mayor and city council deems it to be in the best interest of the citizens of the City of Cartersville to adopt additional regulations governing low pressure systems and permissible residential systems in general, 
    NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by virtue of the authority vested in the city council by law that the following waste treatment ordinance be adopted: 
(2)  Waste treatment ordinance-Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to regulate the available types of waste treatment options for individual uses in the City of Cartersville. The City of Cartersville has experience with individual septic systems and traditional gravity flow systems, and such systems are appropriate for the city. Under more limited circumstances, private sewage facilities may be permitted. The City of Cartersville recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low-pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and higher costs to the homeowner. The city has further determined that the ongoing maintenance issues created by such systems lead to greater future problems than in a conventional gravity flow sewer system. Such systems have many more mechanical and powered parts and are therefore subject to much higher failure rates. Preventative maintenance requirements are higher and power outages can result in overflows and damage to residences. Life cycle replacement costs are higher than gravity sewers. Therefore, this section is adopted to regulate and prohibit such systems, in the interest of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Cartersville. 
(3)  Definitions: As used in this division, words shall have their common meaning and significance, except for the specifically defined terms below: 
(a)  Effluent: The flow of liquids and solids from a structure's sewage plumbing system; e.g., human waste, waste water, etc. 
(b)  Low pressure sewer system: A sewer system that uses pressure to move the effluent from individual lots to the main sewer lines. Pressure sewers typically break down large solids in a pumping station located on an individual lost before they are transported through the collection system (sewer mains) to the treatment facility. Such systems include grinder pump systems and septic tank effluent pump systems. Systems which use a pump-to-pump waste from a septic tank to a septic field on the same lot are not included in this definition. 
(c)  Low pressure sewer system cluster: A pressure sewer system with a common low-pressure line that connects several residences by individual pumps to a central or common pump station. 
(d)  Private sewage facility means a privately owned sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner. Examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site, or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner. 
(e)  Public sewage facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one (1) property owned by different owners. Examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners, or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners. 
(4)  Regulation of waste treatment facilities: 
(a)  Low-pressure sewer systems (including low pressure sewer system clusters) are prohibited in the City of Cartersville. Individual residential lots are required to be connected to a public gravity flow sewer system. 
(b)  Sewage treatment and handling systems for individual residential lots not otherwise covered or defined specifically by this section, or as may be invested in the future, shall only be permitted upon approval of the water superintendent. The applicant shall submit an application as required by the city, containing plans, specifications and other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. The superintendent shall not permit systems or technologies that are unproven, that increase the risks of environmental contamination, that do not meet the standards contained in the City of Cartersville Code of Ordinances or standards as may be adopted by the City of Cartersville Water Department or other applicable ordinance, that increase costs or burdens on the city's sewer system or to individual property owners, or that are found to be a threat in any way to the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(5)  Interpretation: It shall be the duty of the City of Cartersville Water Superintendent to classify proposed systems. If there is a question as to the type of system proposed, or whether it is permitted or prohibited, the superintendent shall make the final interpretation for the water department. His determination may be appealed to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 27-05, § 1, 4-21-05) 
Sec. 24-149. - Unauthorized water usage. 
    Unauthorized water usage through detector check meters for services larger than two (2) inches will be charged at ten (10) times the normal water and sewer rate.

(a)  Excess capacity. That the City of Cartersville Gas System (CGS) has entered into various agreements with Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) whereby CGS has reserved firm capacity to serve its firm requirements. For the reservation of this firm capacity CGS pays Southern a monthly reservation fee. From time to time, CGS has excess firm capacity that it may wish to broker. CGS, at its sole discretion, will determine when there is excess firm capacity to broker. CGS will offer the excess firm capacity first to customers within CGS and secondly to other outside CGS. Brokering of capacity within CGS is limited to CGS transportation customers. Excess capacity will be disposed of through the bidding process at a market sensitive price. 
(b)  Buy-sell agreements prior to 11-1-93. Any winning bidder, who entered into a buy-sell agreement with CGS before November 1, 1993, may choose to use their buy-sell agreement under the conditions set forth by that buy-sell agreement. If a buy-sell agreement is not used by a customer within CGS, then the wellhead cost of gas shall be the ?Spot Price? for the month in which the capacity is being used, plus a mutually agreed upon premium and applicable pipeline shrinkage. 
(c)  Spot price. shall mean the average of the spot prices published by each of the following publications in the first issue of the month for delivery to the pipeline system of Southern during the month in which any unexcused failure by buyer to purchase or sell to deliver gas in accordance with the terms of the buy-sell agreement occurs:

(2)  Inside FERC's Gas Market Report for "Prices of Spot Gas Delivered to Pipelines," "Southern Natural Gas Co.," "Louisiana," "Index." 
(d)  Bidding. When CGS has determined that excess capacity is available, it will solicit sealed bids from those qualified transportation customers for the excess capacity. A bidder may bid on a portion or all of the excess capacity. The excess capacity, if brokered, will be awarded to the bidder(s) whose bid is determined by CGS to be in CGS best economic interest. CGS reserves the right to reject any an all bids. If CGS rejects any or all bids, or if excess capacity remains after the initial bidding process, CGS may offer the excess capacity to others outside CGS. CGS reserves the right to reject any and all bids. 
(e)  Recall ability. Any capacity brokered is recallable with a minimum 4 hour notice, for either CGS system supply or in the event of a limitation on Southern's system. However, anytime capacity is recalled, that capacity will be recalled starting with the lowest price bid and moving up in price until the amount of capacity needed is recalled. Whenever capacity is recalled, the price bid will be prorated for the days that the capacity was not available in a given month. 
(f)  Use prohibition. Unless CGS has rejected bids from customers within CGS due to price, CGS will not allow any capacity obtained from outside its system to be used until CGS excess capacity is fully subscribed. 
(g)  Intention. It is the intention of the city council and it is hereby ordained that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made part of this Code and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such intention.

If the customer uses a gas vendor who also procures gas for other customers on city's system, that vendor's aggregate nomination to Southern (i.e., the sum of the nominations for all customers of the vendor on city's system) may be confirmed by city with Southern. If such aggregate nomination does not match the monthly statement of Southern, city may use the volumes shown on Southern's monthly statement, and, unless notified by the vendor of the correct allocation among the vendor's customers, may prorate the revised aggregate nomination among all of such customers proportionally on the basis of the quantities to be received by each such customer before proration. City shall notify such customers of such change as soon as reasonably practical, and shall have no liability to any customer for any such proration. 
(6)  Customer is responsible for making all arrangements for transporting the customer's gas from its source of supply to city's interconnection with Southern. 
(7)  Customer shall warrant that customer has good and legal title to all gas at and after such time as it has been delivered into city's facilities and a legal right to have such gas delivered to city. Customer shall hold city harmless from any loss or claim arising from a breach of such warranties. 
(8)  Contracts for service shall be in writing and specify in writing the daily and hourly rates of consumption and shall be for a minimum period of one (1) year. 
(9)  The amount of: 
a.  any sales, gross receipts, franchise, excise, privilege, occupation or other tax or charge whether imposed by statute or otherwise that city pays to any governmental body, based on, or determined by, the sale of gas hereunder; and 
b.  any charge paid by city to any gas supplier as a result of any sales, excise, gross receipts, or other taxes, license fee, or governmental charges imposed upon such supplier, based on, or determined by, the production, severance, manufacture, transportation or sale of gas hereunder, shall be added to and become a part of the charges to the customer under this rate schedule; provided, however, if any additional payments are imposed upon the customer by reason of this clause, the customer may by thirty (30) days notice in writing to city, cancel his contract for service under this rate schedule and discontinue the use of natural gas service under this rate schedule. 
(10)  When gas is delivered at a pressure in excess of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute, then for the purpose of measurement hereunder, such volumes of gas shall be corrected to a pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute. It is assumed that the atmospheric pressure is 14.4 pounds per square inch. The measurement of gas volumes shall be adjusted for deviation from Boyle's Law in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices through positive displacement meters at a pressure not in excess of twenty (20) pounds per square inch gauge, at which the gas shall be assumed to obey Boyle's Law. 
Where rotary or turbine type meters are used on installations where customer's annual usage is more than thirty thousand (30,000) decatherms, all volumes measured by such meters shall be corrected to a base temperature of sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit. 
(11)  Gas purchased under this rate shall not be resold by the purchaser thereof in any manner, and city will discontinue service upon notice to the customer when it is determined that gas is being resold in violation of this provision of the rate schedule in the event the customer does not immediately discontinue such resale after such notice. 
(12)  In the event either city or its suppliers is unable, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure or as a result of a curtailment plan permitted to become effective by the regulatory body having jurisdiction, to carry out its obligations, it is agreed that on giving notice of such force majeure as soon as possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, the obligations of city so far as they are affected by such force majeure or curtailment plan shall be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period, and such cause shall as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable dispatch. 
(13)  City reserves the right to refuse to accept customer owned gas for the account of the customer into city's facilities if customer is unable to or fails to follow the terms of this rider. 
(j)  Additional terms and provisions. Service under this schedule is subject to applicable ordinances, terms and conditions of service and rules and regulations of city, as enacted or approved by the city council of the city from time to time, as well as all current and future riders and tariff provisions made applicable to service under this schedule.

2.  Billing for surcharge. The surcharge applicable to gas purchased under this rider shall be payable at the same time and under the same conditions as the rates and charges for volumes provided in the interruptible schedule applicable to the customer. 
(3)  Unauthorized consumption of gas. In the event the customer fails to comply with any curtailment order of city reducing either the customer's hourly or daily use of gas or takes gas in excess of the maximum amount specified in customer's contract with city without prior permission of city, city may elect in its sole discretion any or all of the following options: 
a.  To discontinue completely all deliveries to the customer during the day customer fails to comply with such curtailment order; or 
b.  To require customer to pay city a charge of two (2) times Southern Natural Gas penalty charge per decatherm for all unauthorized gas taken, in addition to the regular charge for such gas. 
(4)  Capital improvements. A charge of $0.078/decatherm shall be applied to all volumes for capital improvements. 
(d)  Character of service. 
(1)  All gas delivered under this rate schedule shall be subject to curtailment in whole or in part only after city has used reasonable efforts to give at least two (2) hours notice to customer by telephone or otherwise, except in force majeure or emergency conditions. City may curtail customers served under this rate schedule in such order and each customer to such extent as city deems necessary for the proper operation of its distribution system. Subject to the foregoing, curtailment by city hereunder shall be made pursuant to the load control provisions in effect from time to time. Upon notice of curtailment by city, the customer must promptly discontinue use of gas as provided in the curtailment notice. 
(2)  It is contemplated that all gas received into city's system will be gas delivered out of a commingled stream from the pipeline system of Southern Natural Gas. The service contemplated hereunder is of an industrial character and city does not guarantee the chemical composition or specific gravity of the gas delivered, nor does city guarantee such gas to be free from interruptions or fluctuations in delivery pressure or that the chemical composition or specific gravity of the gas delivered may not vary from time to time.

(Ord. No. 60-05, § 1, 8-4-05) 
Sec. 24-252. - Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1978 (PURPA) (standards 1-6), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) (standards 7-10), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) (standards 11-15), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) (standards 16-19), and Title 16 USCA Chapter 46 §2601 et seq. (standards 1-24, non-standard 1). 
Compliance. 
(a)  Introduction. Whereas, the City of Cartersville must consider twenty-four (24) federal electric utility rate and service standards, and one (1) non-standard, as required by law since we now sell over five hundred million (500,000,000) kWh's of electricity per year. The intent of these laws is to provide increased conservation, efficiency, and equitable retail rates. These standards must be considered and either accepted or rejected with an explanation; 
    Whereas, each standard should be addressed by ordinance to meet the federal requirements of a) address in writing, b) hold a public hearing, and c) make available to the public; 
    Whereas, each standard stated below has been considered by the electric superintendent, and a recommendation provided for the mayor and city council; 
    Whereas, a public hearing has been held on the proposed standards by the mayor and city council on the third day of June, 2010. 
    Whereas, the applicable laws governing these federal standards are the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1978 (PURPA) (standards 1-6), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) (standards 7-10), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) (standards 11-15), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) (standards 16-19), and Title 16 USCA Chapter 46 §2601 et seq. (standards 1-24, non-standard 1). 
(b)  Analysis of standards. 
(1)  Cost of service. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville "nondemand" electric rates are typically designed for differences in cost-incurrence attributable to seasonal time of use but not daily time of use due to the lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Electric "demand" rates are typically designed for differences in cost-incurrence attributable to customer demand and energy components of cost. Daily time of use options will likely be considered in the future as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. A power cost adjustment is applicable to all electric rates and is utilized to account for additional capacity added to meet peak demand relative to base demand and additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy delivered to electric consumers. The power cost adjustment is reset when a new cost of service study is performed and these differences are included in the revised rates. 
(2)  Declining block rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville utilizes declining block electric demand rates and can demonstrate that cost of energy decreases as customer consumption increases due to assignment of generation greater than load. However, use of declining block demand rates may continue to be used even if costs do not decrease as consumption increases if it is determined to promote economic development or for other reasons. 
(3)  Time-of-day rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize time of day electric rates due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Daily time of use options may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
(4)  Seasonal rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville uses seasonal differences for major "nondemand" electric rates and seasonal billing demand calculations for major "demand" electric rates. However, miscellaneous electric rates for construction, flat power, outdoor lighting, and temporary incentive rates are not appropriate for this seasonal change. 
(5)  Interruptible rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville typically offers interruptible electric rates to those consumers with the ability to curtail at times and levels that will reduce wholesale cost to the utility; however, it is not practical or cost-effective to offer an interruptible rate to each industrial and commercial consumer. 
(6)  Load management techniques. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(7)  Integrated resource planning. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(8)  Investments in conservation and demand management. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
(9)  Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(10)  Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
(11)  Net metering. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that there is a state law that fully addresses this issue in Georgia (O.C.G.A. § 46-3-50 et. seq.). 
(12)  Fuel sources. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(13)  Fossil fuel generation efficiency. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. The basis is that the City of Cartersville's fossil fuel interests are held by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. 
(14)  Time-based metering and communications. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize time-based metering due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Time based metering options may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
(15)  Interconnection. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that there is a state law that fully addresses this issue in Georgia (O.C.G.A. § 46-3-50 et. seq.). 
(16)  Integrated resource planning. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(17)  Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(18)  Consideration of smart grid investments. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
(19)  Smart grid information. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. The options relating to Smart Grid information may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
(20)  Master metering. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
(21)  Automatic adjustment clauses. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville electric automatic adjustment clause is evaluated with each cost of service study and approved by city council. 
(22)  Information to consumers. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the original standard includes mailing each customer a rate sheet when they receive service and every year thereafter. It also includes mailing each customer their previous twelve-month history each month. City of Cartersville electric rates are "open records," available via the internet, a detailed explanation of such rate is available to all consumers upon request, and a personal visit from staff to the consumer's location is available to each customer. Current consumers monthly bills provide the rate name, consumption data for the billing period, consumption data for the previous billing period, and consumption data for the same billing period of the previous year. 
(23)  Procedures for termination of electric service. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not provide prior notice and dispute opportunity to consumers in cases of unsafe or unlawfully obtained services. Termination of service involving consumers with health issues will follow existing "disconnection during illness" policy. 
(24)  Advertising. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville electric utility is owned by the public it serves and is not subject to this standard but makes such standard not to conduct political advertising. 
(25)  The single non-standard: Lifeline rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council decline said non-standard. 
    The basis is that the City of Cartersville residential electric rate is based on a cost of service study for such class of consumer. A rate lower than this rate would increase costs to other residential consumers. 
(c)  Adopted standards. 
(1)  Cost of service. Electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be designed, to the extent practicable, to reflect the costs of providing electric service to such class by a) permitting identification of differences in cost-incurrence, for each such class of electric consumers, attributable to seasonal time of use of service, and/or b) permitting identification of differences in cost-incurrence attributable to differences in customer demand, and energy components of cost. Both methods shall take into account the extent to which total costs are likely to change if additional capacity is added to meet peak demand relative to base demand, and additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy are delivered to electric consumers. 
(2)  Declining block rates. The City of Cartersville utilizes declining block electric demand rates and can demonstrate that cost of energy decreases as customer consumption increases due to assignment of generation greater than load. However, use of declining block demand rates may continue to be used even if costs do not decrease as consumption increases if it is determined to promote economic development or for other reasons. 
(3)  Time-of-day rates. The electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers may include in whole or in part a time-of-day basis which reflects the costs of providing electric service to such class of electric consumers at different times of the day unless such rates are not cost-effective with respect to such class. A time-of-day rate shall be determined to be cost-effective with respect to each such class if the long-run benefits of such rate to the City of Cartersville and its electric consumers in the class concerned are likely to exceed the metering and communications costs and other costs associated with the use of such rates. 
(4)  Seasonal rates. The electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall typically be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for the utility. 
(5)  Interruptible rates. The City of Cartersville may offer an industrial or commercial electric consumer an interruptible rate which reflects the cost of providing interruptible service to the class of which such consumer is a member if it is determined such consumer can and will reduce the wholesale cost to the utility. 
(6)  Load management techniques. The City of Cartersville shall offer to its electric consumers such load management techniques that the City has determined will: 
a.  Be practicable and cost-effective, as determined by: 
1.  Such technique is likely to reduce maximum kilowatt demand on the City of Cartersville, and 
2.  The long-run cost-savings to the utility of such reduction are likely to exceed the long-run costs to the utility associated with implementation of such technique. 
b.  Be reliable, and 
c.  Provide useful energy or capacity management advantages to the City of Cartersville. 
(7)  Integrated resource planning. The City of Cartersville shall employ integrated resource planning.

ARTICLE XII. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 24-433. - Findings. 
    The City Council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia makes the following findings: 
(a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis (stormwater management action plan) submitted to the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities of the city. [A copy is on file and available to the public at the city clerk's office and in the office of the public works department, stormwater utility.] 
(b)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in the incorporated limits of the City of Cartersville in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(c)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of Cartersville. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of Cartersville is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(d)  The stormwater needs in the City of Cartersville include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, tenants, occupants, citizens, and residents of Cartersville in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(e)  The City of Cartersville presently owns and operates a public stormwater management system which has been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater system owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in its corporate limits in concert with the management of other water resources in its corporate limits. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(f)  The mayor and city council finds, concludes, and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Cartersville. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-434. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be a separate division of the public works department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, regulatory compliance, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
(b)  The city manager shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the mayor and city council. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council, upon recommendation of the city manager. 
(c)  The mayor and city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.

    Service area shall mean all land within the corporate limits of the City of Cartersville, including all land areas legally annexed thereto. 
    Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charge or charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the City of Cartersville stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Service charges will be based on measured or estimated impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or of grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to individual customers for services or facilities related to stormwater management, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection or development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
    Stormwater utility shall mean the division of the public works department that is the stormwater utility. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-435. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges. 
    Stormwater service charges may be determined and modified from time to time by the City of Cartersville so that the total revenue generated by said charges and any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility will be sufficient to meet the cost of services and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for consideration and improvements to the stormwater system. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06)

(a)  Detached dwellings units. Two (2) classes of detached dwelling units shall be billed, based on the representative amount of impervious surfaces on the individual properties. The class of smaller detached dwelling units shall include all such properties having less than or equal to three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious area, which shall be charged the rate applicable to one (1) equivalent residential unit as or as amended by ordinance in the future. The class of larger detached dwelling units shall include all detached dwelling unit properties having greater than three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious area, which shall be charged the rate applicable to one and four tenths (1.4) equivalent residential units or as amended by ordinance in the future. 
(b)  Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as detached dwelling units shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit (ERU) for each three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious surface or increment thereof. 
(c)  Stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit (ERU) or increment thereof. The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit on the effective date of stormwater service charges shall be three dollars seventy-five cents ($3.75) per month. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06; Ord. No. 23-07, § 1, 6-7-07) 
Sec. 24-438. - Disposition of service charges and fees. 
    Stormwater utility service charge and fee revenues shall be assigned and dedicated solely to the stormwater management enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, which shall be and remain separate from other funds, and shall be used only to fund identified stormwater management program activities. The services charges and fees paid to and collected by virtue of the provision of this article shall not be used for general or other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for costs incurred by the city in rendering services associated with the stormwater management utility. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-439. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
    Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits shall be defined and made available on two (2) general bases: the ability of a site to reduce its impact on the stormwater system, and the ability of an educational institution to reduce the city's cost of service through its actions in educating its students. Credits shall be available to other developed lands as defined herein: 
(a)  Undeveloped land in its natural state as defined in this chapter and land not containing more than four hundred (400) square feet of impervious area shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(b)  Railroad tracks shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(c)  Any property whereby one-hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff up to and including the design storm which has a one (1) percent chance of occurrence (commonly called the twenty-four-hour, one hundred-year storm) is contained on the premises and no runoff enters into the stormwater management system. The total volume is infiltrated, evaporated, or used for purposes unrelated to stormwater runoff. 
(d)  The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit for non-educationally related actions may be up to sixty (60) percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the ratepayer, reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. The director or appointed representative shall make a final determination of credit eligibility. 
(e)  Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional and related to the effect that such systems have on the: pollution runoff, channel eroding force, peak rate of runoff from the site, and the ability of the site to manage floodplain impacting runoff as expressed in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), copy of which is on file and available to the public at the city clerk's office and in the office of the public works department, stormwater utility. A stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual shall be prepared by the department of public works and is hereby adopted by the city as a part of this article, the original of which shall be kept in the office of the city clerk. The manual shall specify the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(f)  Credits up to fifty (50) percent shall be available to qualified educational institutions that provide an approved course of study that educates students on key aspects of water conservation, pollution prevention, and other topics related to surface and ground water quality. Obtaining such credit does not preclude such educational institution from obtaining additional credits up to a limit of one hundred (100) percent of the fee. Details of such qualifications and credit shall be contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual which shall be prepared by the department of public works specifying the educational requirements which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(g)  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units may receive a stormwater service charge credit. 
(h)  Groups of detached and individual dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services, or activities that reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit in a manner similar to other developed land. 
(i)  In the first year of the stormwater utility, ratepayers seeking service charge credits must submit to the director a stormwater service charge credit application prior to January 1st, 2008. Approved applications shall receive a stormwater credit retroactive to the effective date of stormwater charges. After January 1st, 2008 credits will only be granted through applications approved by the director for the remainder of the year in which stormwater service charges are to be billed. 
(j)  Upon receipt of a timely, completed application, the director or his/her designee shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the date the completed application was submitted to the city. 
(k)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as may be updated or amended from time to time which is hereby adopted by reference by the city and is to be made a part of this article; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities or programs provided, operated, and maintained by the ratepayer, upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article. 
(l)  Continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards may be verified by city personnel physical inspection of the systems or facilities upon which the credit is based. No credit shall be given under this article unless the ratepayer, agrees in writing in its application that the city shall have the right for its designated officers, representatives, agents, and employees to enter upon private and public property, upon reasonable notice to the ratepayer of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering testing, on such property in order to assure compliance with the city's design and performance standards. On-site systems or facilities determined to no longer comply with the city's design and performance standards shall subject the ratepayer, to revocation of all, or a portion of, stormwater service charge credits based on the city inspectors' estimate of capacity reduction for a period of not less than one (1) year.

Sec. 24-441. - Inspection of property and stormwater systems. 
    Every ratepayer, of real property located in the city, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Cartersville ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the City of Cartersville in the Municipal Court of the City of Cartersville, or any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the ratepayer, fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the ratepayer, or contractor or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Bartow County. The City of Cartersville shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the ratepayer, thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to ensure compliance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06)

ARTICLE XIII. - ESTABLISHING STORMWATER UTILITY[38] 

Footnotes: 
--- (38) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, adopted November 2, 2006, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 24-440-24-449. For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 24-451-24-459. 

Sec. 24-451. - Findings. 
    The City Council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia makes the following findings: 
(a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis (Stormwater Management Action Plan) submitted to the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(b)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in Cartersville in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(c)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of Cartersville. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of Cartersville is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(d)  The stormwater needs in the City of Cartersville include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of Cartersville in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(e)  The City of Cartersville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in Cartersville in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(f)  The mayor and city council finds, concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Cartersville. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-452. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be a separate division of the public works department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, regulatory compliance, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
(b)  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the mayor and city council. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
(c)  The mayor and city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-453. - Definitions. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
    Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property. 
    Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
    Stormwater management system. Stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
    Undeveloped land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-454. - Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system. 
    The city drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of Cartersville which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which: 
(1)  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; 
(2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
(3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of Cartersville and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
    It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the City of Cartersville. The City of Cartersville expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-455. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
    All property owners and developers of developed real property within the City of Cartersville shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Cartersville development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and may be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Bartow County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-456. - General financing policy. 
    It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses. 
    Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. To the extent practicable, credits-against service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-457. - Cost analysis and rate study. 
    Upon adoption of this article, the city staff, together with its consulting engineers, shall conduct a cost of services analysis and rate study, which shall be presented to the mayor and city council for their approval, by ordinance, prior to the rendering of any bills to customers of the stormwater utility system. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-458. - Severability. 
    Should any part of this article be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions hereof shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
Sec. 24-459. - Effective date. 
    This article shall become effective January 1, 2007.

ARTICLE XIV. - BUSINESS PARK OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 14.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Business Park Overlay District is to provide uniform regulations for a joint City of Cartersville-Bartow County industrial/business park, a portion of which is located in each jurisdiction. To provide consistency for property owners and future uses, and to benefit the public health, safety and welfare, the city and county have adopted identical regulations as follows. The Business Park Overlay District, where applied via amendment to the official zoning maps of the participating government, shall control over inconsistent regulations contained in other ordinances and the Code of Ordinances of each jurisdiction, whether or not the provisions herein are stronger or weaker restrictions. 
Sec. 14.2. - Boundary map. 
    The boundaries of the portion of the business park located within the city limits of Cartersville are shown in the boundary map included as Exhibit "B" in Article XXV, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this article by reference. 
Sec. 14.3. - General area, height and setback regulations. 
    Minimum lot size: One (1) acre. 
    Maximum lot coverage (impervious surface limitation): Seventy-five (75) percent. 
    Required lot width at street right of way (internal street): Forty (40) feet (twenty-five (25) feet in cul-de-sac). 
    Front setback: Forty (40) feet. 
    Side setback: Fifteen (15) feet. 
    Rear setback: Twenty (20) feet. 
    Maximum building height (see below): Fifty (50) feet. 
    Buffers (see below): Fifty (50) feet except as noted. 
A.  The zoning administrator may grant an administrative variance of up to twenty (20) percent to any of the general area, height and setback regulations listed above. Additionally, he or she may grant an administrative variance on the undisturbed buffer requirements, if the proposed landscaping and screening in the buffer enhances the screening of the adjacent property. 
B.  Building height. With the approval of the zoning administrator, maximum height may be increased by variance. Building height limitations shall not apply to accessory structures such as water towers, conveyer belts, smokestacks and other incidental and uninhabited parts of industrial uses. 
C.  Buffers. A fifty-foot buffer shall apply adjacent to all land uses, except that no buffers shall be required from industrial to industrial. Further, there shall be a two hundred-foot buffer required where shown on the overlay district map adjacent to existing residential uses as of the date of adoption of the overlay district. When any of the existing residential uses are rezoned to a nonresidential zoning classification, the buffer adjacent to that property shall be reduced to fifty (50) feet, unless it is a similar zoning classification, in which case the buffer requirement shall not apply. Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that, if the buffer is adjacent to a residential use, and is insufficiently dense to be opaque to vision year-round, the zoning administrator may require that the buffer shall be planted with sufficient vegetation so that it is opaque year-round, to a depth of at least twenty-five (25) feet. Buffers may be used for perpendicular crossing by access roads and utilities, but not for lateral roads or parking. Buffers may be used for detention ponds, provided that vegetative screening remains or is planted between the pond and the property line. The zoning administrator shall approve buffer plans and plantings. 
D.  Setbacks shall be measured from the property or lot line. As setback exceptions, the following may intrude into the setback zone: unsupported roof overhangs, steps, walkways and access roads, landscaping and irrigation systems, planters, architectural fences and walls not exceeding forty-two (42) inches, and underground utilities and sewers.

No structural alterations shall be made in any structure occupied by a nonconforming use, which would in any way increase the floor space, area, or volume of space occupied by the use, except that the mayor and council may, after a public hearing and review of the proposed plan, grant a special use if it is determined that said use will not be detrimental to the neighboring properties and is not contrary to the intent of this chapter. 
D.  When any nonconforming use of a structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure is discontinued for a period in excess of twelve (12) months, any future use of the structure shall be limited to those uses permitted in that district unless otherwise approved by the mayor and council. Vacancy and/or nonuse of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision. 
(Ord. No. 02-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
Sec. 18.4. - Reconstruction of nonconforming structures. 
    When a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use is razed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, or act of nature, such structure may be reconstructed as a nonconforming use only if the damage totals less than seventy-five (75) percent of the value of the structure; however, this provision shall not apply to owner-occupied dwellings. Structures which do not conform to the yard requirements of this chapter shall also be governed by this provision. 
Sec. 18.5. - Intended nonconforming use. 
    Any intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment thereto shall be prohibited unless such is actually commenced within twelve (12) months of the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment thereto regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
Sec. 18.6. - Changes in zoning. 
    Any nonconformances created by a change in district boundaries or ordinance regulations after the date of passage of this chapter shall also be governed by the provisions of this section. 
Sec. 18-7. - Expansion of existing nonconforming uses requiring special use permits. 
    No nonconforming use, building, structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure, requiring a special use permit under the terms of this chapter, including any use, building or structure that was authorized as of right prior to the adoption of this chapter but would require a special use permit upon the adoption of this chapter, shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner except after application for and approval of a special use permit. Normal repair and maintenance of buildings and structures is authorized without the need for special use permits. No such use, building or structure which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months shall be re-established unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property.

2.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter; and 
5.  A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed.

B.  No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with any city representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties in the enforcement of this chapter. 
19.8.2.  Persons who may be cited. Owners are ultimately responsible for the condition of their property and ensuring that their property and all activity occurring on such property is in compliance with this chapter.

Tenants and invitees would include, but not be limited to, any renter, leaseholder, owner of any vehicle or structure on the property, or other person conducting an activity on the property who is not a trespasser. Corporations and companies responsible for the work may be cited in lieu of or in addition to citations issued to the actual individuals on-site committing violations. 
19.8.3.  Daily violations. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation, subjecting the offender to a new citation, or other civil or criminal proceeding.

B.  A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.

Sec. 21.1. - Establishment of board of zoning appeals. 
21.1.1.  The board of zoning appeals, also referred to as the board of appeals, was established by previous version of this chapter, and remains authorized under this chapter. Existing board members shall continue in their current terms unaffected by the adoption of this chapter. The board consists of seven (7) members appointed by the mayor and city council for staggered terms of four (4) years; except the mayor's appointee, who has a two-year term.

Any vacancy in the membership of the board of appeals shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the mayor and city council upon written charges and after public hearing. The board of appeals previously appointed under the authority of the prior zoning ordinance shall continue without change as if appointed under this chapter.

The board shall adopt such rules and bylaws as they deem appropriate. The board shall meet every month or on such schedule as it chooses to adopt, providing there are matters to consider. If there are no agenda items, the regularly scheduled meeting may be cancelled by the chair.

21.2.3.  The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and may be a public record. 
21.2.4.  All meetings of the board of appeals shall be open to the public. 
Sec. 21.3. - Powers and duties of the board of zoning appeals. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
21.3.1.  Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of this chapter. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or agency of the City of Cartersville affected by any decision of the zoning administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of said decision by filing with the zoning administrator a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten (10) business days of the hearing on the appeal. 
21.3.2.  Continuance of a nonconforming use. The board of zoning appeals may allow a nonconforming use to be reestablished after discontinuance for twelve (12) consecutive months. The procedure for the request shall be the same as if it was a variance. If it is deemed by the board of zoning appeals that one (1) or more of the following apply, the board may grant said request. 
A.  The design, construction, and character of the building is not suitable for uses permitted in the district in which the nonconforming use is situated; and 
B.  Undue hardships to the property owner would result in not allowing the building to be reopened for a nonconforming use; and 
C.  Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such use of the building; and 
D.  The use is to be identical or similar to the prior nonconforming use of the building. 
21.3.3.  Variances. The board of appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of this chapter. Variance may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist: 
A.  That one (1) of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor: 
1.  The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped; 
2.  The property contains exceptional topographic conditions; 
3.  The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions; or 
4.  There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and 
B.  That the strict application of the requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and 
C.  That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten (10) business days of the hearing. 
21.3.4.  Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure, property, development standards or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
21.3.5.  Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Furthermore, the board of appeals shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance. 
21.3.6.  Self-inflicted hardship. The board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to November 7, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or predecessor, that does not justify a variance. 
21.3.7.  Place of worship. In compliance with federal law, if the variance is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the board shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the variance can be granted without harming that interest. 
21.3.8.  Group homes. If the variance is related to a group home for persons with a disability, the board shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this chapter can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this chapter. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability. 
Sec. 21.4. - Applications, hearing and notice.

A fee shall not be charged for applications initiated by the zoning staff, mayor and city council or planning commission. 
Sec. 21.5. - Stay of proceedings. 
    An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life and property.

1.  A proper application has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the ordinance; 
2.  A recommendation has been received from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of Article XXII; 
3.  The applicant is in compliance with the particular conditions for the proposed special use that are required by this chapter, including, but not limited to, those referenced in Article XVI; 
4.  The use is consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter; and 
5.  After considering the application, and the facts, and the standards for making a zoning decision contained in section 22.9 of this chapter, the mayor and city council determines that the standards are satisfied such that the benefits of and need for the proposed conditional use outweigh any possible harmful effects, negative impacts, or damages to the neighboring properties or the city in general. 
23.1.3.  In compliance with federal law, if the special use is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the planning commission and commissioner shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the special use can be granted without harming that interest. 
23.1.4.  If the special use is related to a group home for persons with a disability, the planning commission and mayor and city council shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this chapter can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this chapter. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability. 
23.1.5.  When a proposed special use permit is sought to locate or relocate a half-way house, drug rehabilitation center or other facility for the treatment of drug dependency, an additional public hearing shall be conducted at least six (6) months and not more than nine (9) months before final action by the mayor and city council; such hearing shall be supplemental to the public hearing required under Article XXII and section 23.1.1 above. For the supplemental hearing only, the published notice of the public hearing shall be at least six (6) column inches in size and shall not be located in the classified advertising or legal advertising section of the newspaper and shall publish at least fifteen (15) and not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the hearing. In addition, a sign containing the information required by Article XXII and section 23.1.1 shall be posted conspicuously on the property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing. 
Sec. 23.2. - Action by the mayor and city council. 
    The mayor and city council shall consider all evidence in the record in making their decision. This chapter is automatically a part of the record in each case, as is the entire application file. The mayor and city council shall have the power to table the application for further information to be presented, or to remand the application to the planning commission if new information has been presented that they have not considered. The mayor and city council shall have the power to grant, deny, modify or grant with further specific conditions imposed. 
Sec. 23.3. - Conduct of the hearing. 
    Hearings on special use permits shall follow the procedures of hearings on rezoning amendments, except as modified below. 
Sec. 23.4. - Appeals to superior court. 
    Appeals of any decision to deny or grant a special use permit shall be filed within thirty (30) days by filing an appeal to superior court, pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 5. Such appeal shall be de novo. 
Sec. 23.5. - Reapplication. 
    An application for a special use which has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of twelve (12) months. 
ARTICLE XXIV. - LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS 

Sec. 24.1. - Conflict with other regulations. 
    Whenever the regulations of this chapter require a greater width or size of yards, courts, or other open spaces, or require a lower height of buildings or smaller number of stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other ordinance or statute, the regulations and requirements of this chapter shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute or ordinance require more restrictive standards than are required by this chapter, the provisions of such statute or ordinance shall govern. 
Sec. 24.2. - Separability/severability. 
    Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. It is the intent that any provision declared unconstitutional shall be severed from the ordinance, and the remainder of the ordinance remain in effect. 
Sec. 24.3. - Repealer. 
    This chapter replaces the prior zoning ordinance, adopted November 7, 1996, as amended. In the event all of this chapter is struck down as void, unconstitutional or invalid, including therefore this provision, the prior ordinances shall be considered to not have been repealed, and shall therefore still be in effect. In the event the prior ordinance is declared void, unconstitutional or invalid, the next prior ordinance shall be considered to not have been repealed, and shall therefore still be in effect; and so on. 
Sec. 24.4. - Charge for copy of chapter. 
    There shall be a charge of twenty dollars ($20.00), payable to the City of Cartersville for each copy of this chapter to partially defray publication cost. 
Sec. 24.5. - Effective date. 
    This chapter shall take effect and be in force as of the date of its adoption, the public welfare of the City of Cartersville demanding.
