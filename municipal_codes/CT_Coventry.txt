PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Coventry, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the town, whether by town meeting, board of selectmen or town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance or resolution included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18-1. - Permit, inspection and review fees-Generally. 
(a)  New construction and alterations. The fee for a building permit and all mechanical permits shall be based on the value of the work being done, and shall be charged at the rate of $15.00 per $1,000.00 of value or part thereof. The foregoing fee does not include the education fee required by G.S. § 29-263(b), which fee shall be separately charged and must also be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of the building permit. The calculation of the value of the work shall be based on the most recent schedule established by the International Code Council, Inc., by the Marshall and Swift building cost handbook, or by any other nationally recognized pricing schedule. All fees and costs related to the performance of special, professional and technical services for threshold limit structures, as defined in G.S., § 29-276(b), shall be paid by the owner. Notwithstanding, the building official is authorized to waive all town fees related to building permits for work on crumbling foundations which, based upon the judgment of the building official, are casually related to a reaction to Pyrrhotite or related reasons rather than improper workmanship. Said waiver may include fees for electrical, plumbing or similar fees at the discretion of the building official. 
    Any such waiver shall only apply to work related to the direct replacement of the existing foundation. Upon waiver of any such fee, the building official shall notify the homeowner in writing that such fee has been waived, including an itemization of all fees waived. The building official shall report to the council by January 15th and July 15th of each year setting forth the value of the work and the amount of fees that have been waived, as well as the progress made in repairing said properties and returning them to their fair valuation. 
    This waiver provision shall be effective January 1, 2017. Work that has commenced, but not completed, prior to this effective date may be eligible for a refund of any fees previously paid. 
(b)  Moving of buildings. The fee for a permit for the moving of buildings shall be $15.00 per $1,000.00 of the reasonable cost of such move, including the cost of foundations and all other work associated with the movement and placement of the structure. A contract for such work may be considered as evidence of the reasonable cost, but shall not be binding on the town. 
(c)  Demolition. The fee for a demolition permit for a building shall be $15.00 per $1,000.00 of the assessed value of the building per the current assessor's card. The minimum fee shall be $30.00 and the maximum fee shall be $150.00. 
(d)  Solid fuel stoves, gas or liquid fuel inserts units. The fee for inspection of the installation of a solid fuel stove shall be $30.00, except that, where such installation includes a chimney, the fee shall be $45.00. 
(e)  Repeat inspections and return visits. A fee of $25.00 shall be paid for each second or later inspection of site work caused by either the failure of the owner or builder to make the site ready for inspection at the proper time, or the failure to correct a building code violation previously inspected and noted. 
(f)  Starting work without a permit. The fee for the review of work, as defined in the state building code, started without the proper permits shall be $100.00, 
(g)  Building plan review. The fee for the review of plans for residences and commercial and industrial buildings shall be $75.00. If the same plans are used for the purpose of obtaining a building permit, the plan review fee shall be deemed to be included within the overall building permit fee, as established pursuant to subsection (a). If a plan review fee was paid prior to the issuance of such building permit, the plan review fee shall be credited against the total building permit fee. 
(Ord. No. 195, §§ 1-7, 6-3-96; Ord. No. 210, § 1, 7-17-00; Ord. No. 233, 2-22-11; Ord. No. 251, 2-21-17) 
Sec. 18-2. - Same-Municipal projects. 
    The fees for permits on municipal projects, now a requirement under the zoning laws and the building code in the town, shall be eliminated. 
(Ord. of 12-9-63; Ord. No. 251, 2-21-17) 
Sec. 18-3. - Building in an unapproved subdivision or on an unaccepted street or road. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section, no building permit shall be issued and no building or other structure shall be erected in an unapproved subdivision or on any lot abutting an unaccepted street. Any building or other structure erected in violation of this section shall be deemed unlawful, and the town may commence an action to enjoin the erection of such structure, or cause the structure to be removed. Any person erecting a building or other structure in violation of this section shall be fined not more than as provided in section 1-10 of the Code of Ordinances for each structure so erected, in addition to the relief otherwise available to the town. 
(b)  For the purposes of subsection (a), the term "street" shall be deemed to include the terms "road" and "highway" and shall include both public and private streets, but it shall not be deemed to include driveways, parking areas, or other areas that are or may be provided for motor vehicle circulation or parking solely within individual lots. The provisions of subsection (a) shall not be deemed to apply to any lot abutting both an accepted street and an unaccepted street if primary access to the building site is or will be on the accepted street. 
(c)  This section shall not prevent the issuance of a building permit for the renovation, repair, or alteration of any building or other structure that was in existence on the effective date of this section, provided such renovation, alteration or expansion is not intended or designed to increase the number of families or business entities that occupy any lot. In addition, this section shall not prohibit the construction of farm accessory buildings that are not otherwise in violation of any zoning or building regulations of the town. 
(d)  A building permit may be issued for the erection of buildings or other structures on lots abutting an unaccepted street if all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  A lawfully established property owners' association owns or has legal responsibility for the maintenance of the street, as reflected in the land records of the town; and 
(2)  The street has been continuously maintained by the town and/or a property owners' association up until the date the building permit is to be issued. 
    For the purposes of this subsection, the term "continuously maintained" means that the street has regularly (but not necessarily daily or on any other specific schedule) received such maintenance as has been reasonably necessary to allow safe travel by motor vehicles (for example, paving, grading, drainage, and snow and ice removal). 
(e)  A building permit may also be issued for the erection of buildings or other structures on lots abutting an unaccepted street if all of the following conditions exist or are met: 
(1)  The physical condition of such street, including any associated improvements, is adequate to allow the use of such street by motor vehicles without unreasonable risk or danger to the public health, safety and welfare; 
(2)  Adequate arrangements are made by the subdivision developer, landowner, prospective builder or other private party for continuing maintenance of the street until such time as the street is accepted by the town. Such arrangements must be made in the form of a written agreement with the town and must include adequate financial security, all of which must be approved as to form by the town attorney; 
(3)  The subdivision developer, landowner, prospective builder or other private party provides a policy of insurance, naming the town as the insured or as an additional insured, against all claims for personal and property damage caused by or arising from the condition of the street. The minimum amount of such insurance coverage shall be $2,000,000 per person per claim for personal injury and $2,000,000 per claim for property damage. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to make the town liable for any such personal injury or property damage or to relieve the subdivision developer, landowner, prospective builder or other private party from any and all liability such party may otherwise have for such injury or damage. 
(Ord. of 1-31-61; Ord. No. 223, § 1, 2-7-05) 
Sec. 18-4. - Withholding of building permits when taxes or sewer charges are delinquent. 
(a)  Before any application for a building permit may be approved by the building official or other authorized agent of the town, such official or agent shall consult with the office of the tax collector to determine whether any property taxes or any sewer charges, rates, or assessments are delinquent for the property for which the application has been made. 
(b)  In the event the office of the tax collector determines that any such property taxes or sewer charges, rates or assessments are delinquent, such application for a building permit shall not be approved, except as provided in subsection (e) below, and the building official or other authorized agent of the town shall stamp or write the words "approval withheld per tax collector" on such application. 
(c)  Except as provided in subsection (e) below, the building official or other authorized agent of the town may not approve any application for a building permit unless and until the office of the tax collector advises such official or agent that there are no delinquent property taxes or sewer charges, rates, or assessments relating to the property for which the application has been made. 
(d)  Except as provided in subsection (e) below, the approval of any application for a building permit for property for which any property taxes or any sewer charges, rates or assessments are delinquent shall be deemed void and of no legal effect if such approval was given at any time during which such delinquency existed. If the delinquent amounts are fully paid after such invalid approval is granted, the building permit shall not be fully validated and effective until a new approval is endorsed on such application by the building official or other authorized agent of the town after consulting with the office of the tax collector. 
(e)  In the event the town manager determines that the approval of an application for a building permit is necessary for, or would substantially promote, the public health by remediating or removing a nuisance or other conditions detrimental to the public, or that such approval would otherwise facilitate the payment of delinquent property taxes or sewer charges, rates, or assessments, the town manager may authorize the building official or other authorized agent of the town to issue such building permit despite the existence of any such delinquency. Such approval shall be made in writing. The town manager must condition any such approval on an agreement by the applicant to pay the balance of the overdue taxes, charges, rates, or assessments by a date certain or in accordance with a fixed schedule, unless the town council waives such requirement upon the request of the applicant for good cause shown. 
(Ord. No. 202, §§ 1-5, 5-3-99; Ord. No. 209, § 1, 7-17-00) 
Sec. 18-5. - Maintenance of unaccepted streets. 
    Any person who owns or controls a street or portion of a street that was constructed pursuant to the approval by the planning and zoning commission of subdivision plans on which such construction had been proposed, but that has not yet been accepted by the town, shall be responsible for maintaining the physical condition of the street in a safe condition for vehicular passage by all persons who are allowed or authorized to use such street, including, but not limited to, any persons who have acquired lots within the approved subdivision. Such responsibilities shall include routine winter maintenance, such as plowing, snow removal, sanding and salting when appropriate. In the event such maintenance is not provided as required by this section, the town may, but shall not be obligated to, supply such maintenance, and any person who owns or controls such unaccepted street or portion thereof shall be liable to reimburse the town for the costs and expenses of such maintenance, including all costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, the town may incur in order to obtain such reimbursement.

(Ord. No. 230, 1-4-10) 
Sec. 18-45. - Entry, inspection and remediation.

(c)  This article shall not affect violations of any other ordinances, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date of this Code, and any such violations may be governed and continue to be punishable under the provisions of those ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at the time the violation was committed. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prohibit the town, acting through its building official, from enforcing the provisions of sections 120.0 through 122.4 of the State Basic Building Code, as amended, as it applies to unsafe structures, fire-damaged structures or deteriorated structures and the demolition and/or removal of the same.

Sec. 78-3. - Citation procedures and fines for zoning violations. 
(a)  The zoning agent (zoning enforcement officer) is authorized to issue citations for violations of the zoning regulations of the town, to the extent and in the manner provided by this section. Any such citation may be served either by hand delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person named in such citation. If the person named in a citation sent by certified mail refuses to accept such mail, the citation may be sent by regular United States mail. The zoning agent shall file and retain an original or certified copy of the citation. 
(b)  Citations may be issued only for the following types of zoning violations: failure to properly install or maintain any erosion or sedimentation controls (including, but not limited to, silt fence, hay bales, and anti-tracking pad) required either by the zoning regulations or the terms or conditions of any permit or approval issued pursuant to those regulations. 
(c)  The fine for each such citation shall be $150.00. All fines shall be made payable to the Treasurer of the Town of Coventry. 
(d)  Any person receiving such a citation shall be allowed a period of 30 days from his or her receipt of the citation to make an uncontested payment of the fine specified in the citation to the treasurer. If the citation has been sent by regular mail pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the day of receipt of the citation shall be deemed to be three business days after the day of mailing of the citation. 
(e)  If a person who has been issued a citation does not make uncontested payment of the fine specified in the citation to the treasurer within the time allowed under subsection (d), the zoning agent shall send a notice to the person cited, informing such person: (1) of the allegations against him or her, the amount of the fines, and the imposition of the administrative fee set forth in subsection (f); (2) that the person cited may contest liability before a hearing officer appointed by the town manager, as provided in subsection (i), by delivering, in person or by mail, within ten days of the date of the notice, a written demand for a hearing; (3) that if the person cited does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and judgment shall be entered against him or her; and (4) that such judgment may issue without further notice. 
(f)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (e) wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he or she may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fine, together with an additional administrative fee of $25.00, either in person or by mail, to the zoning agent. All fines and fees shall be made payable to the Treasurer of the Town of Coventry. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten days of the date of the notice described in subsection (e) shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the zoning agent shall certify to the hearing officer that such person has failed to respond. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines and fees provided for by this section and shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection (h). 
(g)  Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. The presence of the zoning agent shall be required at the hearing if requested by the person who was issued the citation. A person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his or her behalf. The zoning agent may present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If the person who received the citation fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable provisions of the zoning regulations. The hearing officer may accept written information by mail from the person who received the citation and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he or she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is not liable, the hearing officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that determination in writing accordingly. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is liable for the violation, the hearing officer shall forthwith enter and assess the fines and fees against such person as provided by this section, including an additional hearing fee of $50.00. 
(h)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of the Superior Court for Geographical Area No. 19 in Rockville, together with an entry fee of $8.00 or such other amount as may be required by state law. Further proceedings may then be held pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
(i)  The town manager shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers to conduct the hearings provided by this section. Neither the zoning agent, the building inspector, nor any other employee of the town may be appointed as a hearing officer pursuant to this section. The rate of compensation of the hearing officer shall be determined by the town manager. 
(j)  No citation shall be issued pursuant to this section unless (1) the zoning agent has provided notice of the violation to the person who would receive the citation; (2) the notice specifies a reasonable time for the violation to be corrected; and (3) the violation is not corrected within the time required. The hearing officer shall not uphold the issuance of any citation if he or she determines that the time provided for the violation to be corrected was unreasonable under all of the circumstances.

Sec. 78-71. - Adoption of state enabling legislation. 
    The town accepts and adopts the state enabling legislation on zoning, covered by chapter 124 of the general statutes (G.S. § 8-1 et seq.), and municipal planning commission covered by chapter 126 of general statutes (G.S. § 8-18 et seq.). 
(Res. of 6-4-51) 
Sec. 78-72. - Zoning commission empowered to act as planning commission. 
    In accordance with G.S. § 8-4a, the members of the town zoning commission are empowered to act as the town planning commission. 
(Res. of 6-4-51) 
Sec. 78-73. - Right to farm-Preamble. 
    The CT General Statutes Section 19a-341 of the State of Connecticut has declared that "no agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility, or any of its appurtenances, or the operation thereof, shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance" provided the operation is following generally accepted agricultural practices. Generally accepted agricultural practices are determined by the Commissioner of Agriculture. 
    Several towns in CT have recently passed local Right-to-Farm(RTF) Ordinances. Some of these towns include: Brooklyn, Canterbury, Colchester, Columbia, Eastford, Granby, Glastonbury, Franklin, Hampton, Lebanon, Shelton, Suffield, Sprague, Thompson, and Woodstock. A local RTF ordinance reinforces this State Statute by emphasizing that a municipality supports local farms and farm businesses and views agriculture as a valued activity in the town. They are particularly useful where new residential and commercial development occurs adjacent to active farms. While new residences may be drawn by the charm of the rural landscape, they soon realize that farm operations create dust, odors and noise. In reaction to these perceived nuisances, non-farm neighbors may lodge complaints with the town or file lawsuits that can cripple or shut down farm operations. A local RTF ordinance may help new residences prepare for living in a farming community. 
    Additionally, local RTF ordinances are more likely to become a matter of public policy within a community and are more easily recognized and administered. Clearly stating what the town values may limit nuisance lawsuits or other farm and non-farm conflicts and establishes a vision for the town regarding agriculture that is less likely to change over time with the administration and personnel of the regulatory commissions. Knowing that the Town supports farms allows current farmers to reinvest in their farms knowing they have the support of the community despite future changes in town administration and many encourage new farmers into the community. 
    In conjunction with examining local zoning regulations, tax policies, and supporting "buy local" initiatives, a local RTF ordinance reaffirms a town's commitment to agriculture and identifies farming as an accepted and valued activity. 
(Ord. No. 240, 6-3-13) 
Sec. 78-74. - Purpose and intent. 
    Pursuant to the powers conferred upon by G.S. § 7-148(c)(7)(E), (8), and, (10)(A), and furtherance of the goals of G.S. § 19a-341, the town adopts this section to officially recognize the importance of protecting agriculture as a whole because of its importance to the preservation of the Town's rural quality of life. This section encourages the pursuit of agriculture, promotes agricultural-based economic opportunities, and protects farmland within the town by allowing agricultural uses and related activities to function with minimal conflict with abutters and town agencies. Coventry recognizes the importance of farming to its history/heritage, culture, scenic vistas, and wildlife. It also recognizes the value it brings to its tax base, and economic development through local food security and other agricultural products. 
(Ord. No. 240, § I, 6-3-13)

Sec. 78-76. - Right to farm. 
    G.S. § 19a-341 notwithstanding, any general statute or municipal ordinance or regulation pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility, or any of its appurtenances, or the operation thereof, shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public or private, due to alleged objectionable: 
(1)  Odor from livestock, manure, fertilizer or feed, 
(2)  Noise from livestock, or farm equipment used in normal, generally acceptable farming procedures,

Any such citation may be served either by hand delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person named in such citation. If the person named in a citation sent by certified mail refuses to accept such mail, the citation may be sent by regular United States mail. The wetlands agent shall file and retain an original or certified copy of the citation. 
(b)  Citations may be issued only for the following types of inland wetlands and watercourses violations: failure to properly install or maintain any erosion or sedimentation controls (including, but not limited to, silt fence, hay bales, and anti-tracking pad) required either by the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations or the terms or conditions of any permit or approval issued pursuant to those regulations. 
(c)  The fine for the first such citation issued to any person with respect to any specific parcel of land shall be $250.00. The fine for the second or subsequent citations issued to any person with respect to any specific parcel of land shall be $500.00. All fines shall be made payable to the Treasurer of the Town of Coventry. 
(d)  Any person receiving such a citation shall be allowed a period of 30 days from his or her receipt of the citation to make an uncontested payment of the fine specified in the citation to the treasurer. If the citation has been sent by regular mail pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the day of receipt of the citation shall be deemed to be three business days after the day of mailing of the citation. 
(e)  If a person who has been issued a citation does not make uncontested payment of the fine specified in the citation to the treasurer within the time allowed under subsection (d), the wetlands agent shall send a notice to the person cited, informing such person: (1) of the allegations against him or her, the amount of the fines, and the imposition of the administrative fee set forth in subsection (f); (2) that the person cited may contest liability before a hearing officer appointed by the town manager, as provided in subsection (i), by delivering, in person or by mail, within ten days of the date of the notice, a written demand for a hearing; (3) that if the person cited does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and judgment shall be entered against him or her; and (4) that such judgment may issue without further notice. 
(f)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (e) wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he or she may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fine, together with an additional administrative fee of $25.00, either in person or by mail, to the wetlands agent. All fines and fees shall be made payable to the Treasurer of the Town of Coventry. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten days of the date of the notice described in subsection (e) shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the wetlands agent shall certify to the hearing officer that such person has failed to respond. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines and fees provided for by this section and shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection (h). 
(g)  Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. The presence of the wetlands agent shall be required at the hearing if requested by the person who was issued the citation. A person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his or her behalf. The wetlands agent may present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If the person who received the citation fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable provisions of the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations. The hearing officer may accept written information by mail from the person who received the citation and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and from and with such methods of proof as he or she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is not liable, the hearing officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that determination in writing accordingly. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is liable for the violation, the hearing officer shall forthwith enter and assess the fines against such person as provided by this section, including an additional hearing fee of $50.00. 
(h)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12 months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of the Superior Court for Geographical Area No. 19 in Rockville, together with an entry fee of $8.00 or such other amount as may be required by state law. Further proceedings may then be held pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
(i)  The town manager shall appoint one or more citation hearing officers to conduct the hearings provided by this section. Neither the wetlands agent, the building inspector, nor any other employee of the town may be appointed as a hearing officer pursuant to this section. The rate of compensation of the hearing officer shall be determined by the town manager. 
(j)  No citation shall be issued pursuant to this section unless (1) the wetlands agent has provided notice of the violation to the person who would receive the citation; (2) the notice specifies a reasonable time for the violation to be corrected; and (3) the violation is not corrected within the time required. The hearing officer shall not uphold the issuance of any citation if he or she determines that the time provided for the violation to be corrected was unreasonable under all of the circumstances.

Sec. 86-146. - Alterations and improvements. 
(a)  Petitions. Any person, corporation and/or town agency may petition the town council to alter or improve a scenic road designated under this article. 
(b)  Procedure. Except for work authorized by subsections (c) or (d) of this section, any highway which has been designated as a scenic road under this article may be altered or improved including, but not limited to, widening of the right-of-way or traveled portion of the highway, paving, changing the grade, straightening, removing of stone walls or removing of mature trees, only upon the vote of two-thirds of the town council. The town council shall not act until it has referred the matter to the planning and zoning commission and received a report from the commission. Prior to submitting its report to the town council, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing, notice of which shall be sent to the owners of record abutting the scenic road. The council shall record in its minutes the reasons for the alterations or improvements should such alterations or improvements be authorized. 
(c)  Emergency, routine and minor maintenance. Emergency, routine and minor maintenance on any highway which has been designated as a scenic road under this article shall be continued by the town without the necessity of a council vote, referral to the planning and zoning commission or public hearing. Such work shall include the removal of dead, diseased, damaged or dangerous trees and branches of trees which present a clear, imminent danger to the public; trimming of the tree branches that encroach on the traveled portion of the highway below the height needed to allow school buses, emergency vehicles and town road maintenance vehicles to pass; trimming or removal of brush and removal of boulders or other obstacles that encroach on the traveled portion of the road; necessary trimming for utility lines; trimming of brush to enhance and protect scenic views, stone walls and mature trees; correction of drainage problems; striping, graveling, filling, retreatment including, but not limited to, overlay paving and chipsealing and repair of existing roadway surfaces; grading; snowplowing; sanding; and emergency repairs to such road in the case of a natural disaster making it impassable or unsafe for public travel. 
(d)  Authorized acts. Any highway which has been designated as a scenic road under this article may be altered or improved including, but not limited to, widening of the right-of-way or traveled portion of the highway, paving, changing the grade, removal of the stone walls, ledge or boulders, installation of drainage facilities, straightening or removal of vegetation, including mature trees, provided the planning and zoning commission determines that the alterations or improvements are necessary to protect and promote public safety in conjunction with the approval of a new driveway, a new highway or a new subdivision or other land use development that is directly accessed by the subject scenic road and is under the planning and zoning commission's regulatory jurisdiction. Any such alteration or improvement to a scenic road shall not be approved unless a public hearing has been held on the subject project, notice of which shall be sent to owners of record abutting the scenic road. Any alterations or improvements authorized by this section shall be the minimum necessary to address safety issues associated with the new driveway, highway or land use development and any approved alteration or improvement shall be designed to minimize impacts on the scenic characteristics of the subject scenic road. No alteration or improvement shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission until potential alternative solutions have been considered thoroughly. Stone wall relocations and reconstructions, the planting of new trees, shrubs or flowers, the installation of underground utilities and other mitigating measures may be required by the planning and zoning commission in conjunction with its authorization of alterations or improvements to scenic roads.

(Ord. No. 170, § 6, 10-15-90) 
Sec. 86-147. - Preservation of scenic characteristics; considerations. 
    Any alterations and improvements of a designated scenic road shall be carried out so as to preserve to the highest degree possible the scenic characteristics of the highway. Any proposed alteration to a scenic road shall be reviewed by the appropriate authority with due regard to the following: 
(1)  Alternatives. A thorough review of alternative solutions to minimize impacts on scenic characteristics. 
(2)  Speed limits. Scenic values often are correlated with lower speeds. Speed limits on scenic roads shall be posted and enforced. 
(3)  Curves. Scenic values often are correlated with the existence of curves which allow a constant unfolding of new and changing views. Curves shall not be eliminated unless clearly necessary for traffic safety. 
(4)  Grades. Hills and valleys often are correlated with scenic values. They shall not be destroyed by cuts and fills unless clearly necessary for traffic safety. 
(5)  Widths. A narrow road often is correlated with scenic beauty. Designated highways should not be widened unless clearly necessary for traffic safety. 
(6)  Side slopes. Existing steepness of side slopes often is preferable to reduction of gradient by extensive removal of soil and rock. This is especially true where the slopes are fully stabilized and where they are rich with existing ground cover, shrubs and trees. 
(7)  Vistas. Vistas of distant landscapes shall be preserved by suitable vegetation management techniques. 
(8)  Utility lines. Wherever possible, utility lines should be placed underground. Where they are overhead, the utility companies should be encouraged to cooperate by implementing suitable vegetation management techniques which preserve trees, wildflowers and shrubs. 
(9)  Vegetation. Vegetation on the side of the road shall be managed in such a way as to preserve wildflowers, shrubs of ornamental and wildlife values and trees. Overarching, isolated trees and the canopy of a closed forest can have extremely high scenic value. 
(10)  Billboards; sand, gravel and salt piles; refuse disposal; and other unsightly structures or situations. Billboards; sand, gravel and salt piles; refuse disposal; and other unsightly structures or situations shall be forbidden. Where possible, scenic and preservation easements should be acquired from adjacent owners to ensure the continuance of natural relief, desirable features, and scenic and historic values in the public interest. 
(Ord. No. 170, § 7, 10-15-90) 
Sec. 86-148. - Enforcement; penalty for violation of article. 
    This article shall be enforced by the planning and zoning commission, acting through its designated enforcement officials. Violation of this article shall be subject to a fine as provided in section 1-10 for each day that such violation continues, and such other legal remedies as may be available to the planning and zoning commission. If enforcement is sought through the courts and judgment is rendered for the town, the court, in the event of a willful violation, shall award to the town as costs a reasonable attorney's fee. 
(Ord. No. 170, § 8, 10-15-90)

CHAPTER I
CHAPTER I -- PURPOSEPURPOSE
a) These Regulations have been adopted by the Coventry Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to the authority granted in Chapter 126 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut. It is declared to be the policy of the Commission to consider land subdivision as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and economic development of the Town so as to further the general welfare and prosperity of its people. Accordingly, it is the purpose of these Regulations to insure that land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety; that proper provision is made for water supply, surface drainage and sanitary sewerage, and, in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding, that proper provision is made for protective flood control measures; that proposed roads are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the Plan of Conservation and Development, as the same may be amended from time to time, especially with regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares; that proposed roads are so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs, and that roads and driveways provide adequate access to properties for fire-fighting apparatus and other emergency services; that, when and in places deemed proper by the Commission, open spaces for parks and playgrounds are provided in subdivision plans; that proper provision is made for soil erosion and sediment control pursuant to Section 22a-329 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut; and that provisions are made for energy-efficient patterns of development and land use, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation. [amended effective 12/14/98]
b) These Regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, regulation, or other provision of law, or any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or legal relationship. With regard to any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or legal relationship, it is not the purpose of these Regulations to intercede in, resolve, or arbitrate any private civil dispute. When these Regulations impose restrictions different from those imposed by any other statute, ordinance, or other requirement imposed by any level of government, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.

CHAPTER III
CHAPTER III -- PROCEDURPROCEDUREE
SECTION 1. REQUIREMENT OF APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLAN
a) Subdivision Plan Approved and the Sale of Lots. All plans for the subdivision or resubdivision of land must be submitted to the Commission for approval. No lot resulting from the subdivision or resubdivision of any tract or parcel of land shall be sold or offered for sale or used for building development and no Certificate of Zoning Compliance (Zoning Permit) for any use, nor any building permit for the erection or enlargement of any building on such lot, shall be granted without the prior approval of the subdivision or resubdivision plan, or any amendment thereof, by the Commission, and the filing of the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan in the Office of the Town Clerk. [amended effective 12/14/98]
b) Purpose of Recommended Preliminary Procedure. Before submitting an application for a Final Subdivision Plan, the applicant should follow the preliminary procedure described in Chapter III, Section 2 to save time and expense. This is a recommendation and not a requirement. An application requesting consideration of the proposal under "Preliminary Layout", Chapter III, Section 2 shall be submitted by the applicant.
c) Amendment of Approved Subdivision Plans. The Commission may approve an amendment to, or a modification of, an approved Final Subdivision Plan upon written application. If the proposed amendment or modification involves or includes any change in a property line, improvement or other physical feature shown on the approved Final Subdivision Plan, the applicant must submit ten (10) copies of a proposed amended Final Subdivision Plan. For each application, the applicant shall also submit such additional information and documents as is reasonably necessary, or as the Commission may require, to understand the nature and purpose of the proposed modification or amendment. All provisions of the original approved subdivision or resubdivision shall be complied with, except as specifically approved by the Commission. No amended subdivision shall be deemed final until an endorsed Final Subdivision Plan showing all approved changes from the originally approved Final Subdivision Plan has been filed in the Office of the Town Clerk. [added effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 2. PRELIMINARY LAYOUT
a) Application. The applicant may present to the Commission a request for the consideration of a Preliminary Layout. Up to fifteen (15) paper prints of the Preliminary Layout, in accordance with Chapter IV, Section 1 of these Regulations, shall be filed with the request. [amended effective 12/14/98]
b) Technical Reports. It is recommended that the applicant obtain from a licensed sanitary or civil engineer a written report or reports as to the general feasibility of the proposed water supply and the proposed drainage plan and sewage disposal in the area to be
Page 12 of 57
subdivided, and provide such report(s) to the Commission. The Commission may require the applicant to perform seepage or other tests and may request such other report(s) as it deems advisable to evaluate compliance with these Regulations. [amended effective 12/14/98]
c) Check by Commission. At the time of the filing of a request for the consideration of a Preliminary Layout, the Commission or its designee shall check such request and layout and when the information contained in the request is substantially complete in accordance with Chapter IV, Section 1 of these Regulations, the matter shall be placed on the agenda for a public meeting of the Commission. Whenever desirable, the Commission and/or its representative(s) may examine the site of the proposed subdivision prior to the meeting, and the applicant, by making a request under this Section, shall be deemed to consent to such site examination. The Commission shall give reasonable notice to the applicant of any proposed site inspections and the applicant shall be entitled to attend any such inspections. [amended effective 12/14/98]
d) Notice of the Meeting of Commission. The Commission shall notify the applicant, prior to the meeting, of the date, time and place of the meeting of the Commission at which the Preliminary Layout is to be considered. The applicant or a fully authorized representative should attend the meeting unless unable to do so, and should notify the Commission at least one day prior to the meeting if unable to attend. [amended effective 12/14/98]
e) Consideration of Preliminary Layout. The Preliminary Layout will be considered at a public meeting of the Commission. The Commission may hold a public hearing on any such request, and even in the absence of a public hearing, may, in its sole discretion, permit persons to be heard at such meeting. [amended effective 12/14/98]
f) Effect of Consideration of Preliminary Layout. The purpose of the consideration of the Preliminary Layout is purely to provide preliminary guidance to the applicant, and to identify areas of concern or further study, so as to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to the public, the applicant, and the Commission upon the future receipt, if any, of a formal application for subdivision. Neither the applicant nor the Commission shall be in any way bound by any statement made during such Preliminary Layout consideration, it being acknowledged by the applicant that the Commission's responses, like the request itself, are preliminary and subject to further change and refinement. There shall be no vote or other formal action on any request for Preliminary Layout consideration, other than referrals to other municipal, State, or Federal agencies for review and comment if deemed advisable by the Commission. [from former paragraph (g), amended effective 12/14/98]

[amended effective 12/14/98]
c) Notice of Meeting of Commission.

[amended effective 12/14/98]
e) Action by the Commission. Except as otherwise provided herein the Commission shall take action on the Formal Subdivision application within sixty-five (65) days from the Date of Receipt of the application if no public hearing is held, or within sixty-five (65) days from the close of the public hearing, except that upon written consent of the applicant, the time limitation may be extended by the Commission one or more times, so long as the total period of any such extension or extensions does not exceed the original time period.

"Modification", as used in this Section, may include conditions that must be satisfied prior to endorsement and filing of the Final Subdivision Plan, prior to the issuance of Certificates of Zoning Compliance, prior to the release of bonds, or at other appropriate points in time. In the case of any application involving an area regulated under the Coventry Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations, the Commission shall not act on the subdivision application until it has received a report from the Inland Wetlands Agency pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-26.
In such cases, the time limit for the Commissions action shall be the later of (i) the time limit set forth above, or (ii) thirty-five (35) days following a final decision on such application by the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency. [amended effective 12/14/98]
Page 16 of 57
f) Notification of Action. Within fifteen (15) days after action by the Commission, the Commission shall notify the applicant by registered or certified mail of the action taken by the Commission, and shall also cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of Coventry. Such notice shall be a simple statement that such application was approved, modified and approved, or disapproved, together with the date of such action.
g) Endorsement of Final Subdivision Plan. Following approval of a Formal Subdivision application, the applicant shall promptly provide a Final Subdivision Plan on mylar, which Plan shall incorporate any modification attached to such approval, and shall be accompanied by any documents required by these Regulations, such as bonds, road deeds, conservation and drainage easements, and the like. Any conveyance to the Town of Coventry shall be accompanied by a current Certificate of Title, prepared by an attorney admitted to the bar of the State of Connecticut, and certifying that such conveyance is free and clear of, or subordinated to, any mortgage, lien, restriction, or other encumbrance. The Plan on mylar shall include, reproduced on the face thereof, a copy of the Commissions decision to approve including any conditions or modifications made a part thereof. Upon determining that the Final Subdivision Plan properly incorporates all matters required by the Commissions decision and by these Regulations the Commission Chairman or other authorized official shall endorse the Commissions approval on the Plan.
h) Filing of Plan. Following the endorsement of the Final Subdivision Plan in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the applicant shall file the endorsed mylar of the Plan with the Town Clerk and pay any necessary filing fees. Such filing must be made within ninety (90) days after the expiration of the appeal period as set forth in Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-8 or, if an appeal is taken under that statute, within ninety (90) days of termination of the appeal by dismissal, withdrawal, or judgment in favor of the applicant. The Commission may, upon request of the applicant, grant up to two (2) extensions of up to ninety (90) days each for such filing. Any Final Subdivision Plan not so filed shall become void. The Commission shall have no responsibility to retain any Final Subdivision Plans rendered void by operation of this provision. [amended effective 12/14/98]
i) Alteration of Final Subdivision Plan Prior to Filing with Town Clerk. If the Final Subdivision Plan is altered, changed, erased or revised in any way between the time the Commission's approval is endorsed thereon and the time the Plan is filed with the Town Clerk, the approval shall be void unless the alteration has been approved by the Commission and so indicated on the Plan. [amended effective 12/14/98]
j) Alteration of Final Subdivision Plan After Filing with Town Clerk. If the Final Subdivision Plan is altered, changed, erased, or revised in any way after the time the Plan is filed with the Town Clerk, such changes shall be deemed ineffective and void unless they have been approved by the Commission and a new mylar Plan showing such changes has been endorsed and filed with the Town Clerk. If the Commission finds that any such changes were made by the applicant or the applicants successor in interest, the Commission may, after a hearing at which the applicant or applicants successor in interest is given an opportunity to be heard, revoke and terminate its approval of the Final
Page 17 of 57
Subdivision Plan. [added effective 12/14/98]
[Section 4 deleted effective 12/14/98]
CHAPTER IV
CHAPTER IV -- SPECIFICATIONS FOR PRELIMINARYSPECIFICATIONS FOR PRELIMINARY LAYOUTS, LAYOUTS, FORMAL FORMAL SUBDIVISION PLANS AND PLANSUBDIVISION PLANS AND PLAN--PROFILESPROFILES
[Chapter IV, Section 1-3 revised - effective 08/01/11]
SECTION 1. PRELIMINARY REVIEW
a) Preliminary Review Option
The Commission hereby establishes an optional, preliminary subdivision review process, to be called Preliminary Review in these Regulations. In a Preliminary Review, a prospective future subdivision application may be submitted to the Commission for informal, non-binding review and comment. In order to commence the Preliminary Review process, the prospective applicant must submit to the Commission a letter requesting such review, together with a Preliminary Layout, as described in Section 2, below. The Commissions preliminary review of a subdivision plan and any comments that may be made by any members of the Commission during such Preliminary Review shall be for informal guidance purposes only and shall not be binding with respect to any aspect of the plan during any later, formal subdivision application.
b) Purpose and Goals of Preliminary Review
In establishing a Preliminary Review process, the Commission seeks to enhance the opportunity for an open and creative dialogue with the applicant, to better understand the applicants development vision and objectives, and to increase the opportunity for coordination with other reviewing agencies and officials. As a result of this process, the Commission may have the ability to reduce the formal requirements for final subdivision review, thereby reducing the costs and burdens on the applicant, and to better manage and reduce the time required for processing a final subdivision application.
i. Enhanced Dialogue and Coordination. A formal (final) subdivision application requires the Commission to consider the Towns interest in protecting the publics health and safety; the provision of adequate facilities for water, sewerage and drainage; the need for a harmonious, adequate and convenient system of streets, open spaces, parks and playgrounds; and other interests as set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes and other applicable provisions of state law. In addressing these varied issues, the Commission may have a substantially different view from a subdivision applicant of the optimal manner in which a parcel of land should be divided and public facilities provided. The Preliminary Review process allows a prospective applicant and the Commission an opportunity to share their respective goals and visions at an early stage, before the applicant has invested heavily in detailed plans. The Commission believes this process will lead to better subdivision design, and will reduce the likelihood of a contentious or unnecessarily protracted, formal subdivision process, with its inherent costs and delays.
Page 18 of 57
ii. Reduction of Formal Application Requirements. In order to properly address these many interests and concerns, the Commission must ordinarily require the applicant to provide a wide variety of information and data. Because of the relatively short statutory deadlines for processing a formal subdivision application, the applicant may be forced to choose between (1) providing expensive, but ultimately unnecessary, information to the Commission, or (2) failing to provide sufficient information for the Commission to approve the application. The Preliminary Review process is a means for the applicant and the Commission to discuss the types and range of information the Commission is likely to need for a formal subdivision application. During a Preliminary Review, the Commission may be able to determine that it would not need certain types of information for final review, thereby minimizing the chances that the applicant will incur unnecessary costs or delays in the final review process.
SECTION 2. PRELIMINARY LAYOUT
a) Required Information.
A Preliminary Review, as described in Section 1, above, shall require the submission of a Preliminary Layout. Preliminary Layouts submitted to the Commission shall be drawings or prints of drawings at a scale of one inch equals forty feet (1" = 40) or one hundred (1" = 100') feet on sheets either eighteen by twenty-four (18" x 24"), or twenty-four by thirty-six inches (24" x 36") in size, and shall contain the following information:
1) Names of owner(s) and applicant(s), proposed subdivision name and identifying title, location of subdivision, approximate north arrow and scale and date of drawing.
2) Location and approximate dimensions of all existing property lines of the subdivision including assessor's block and parcel numbers.
3) All physical features, such as existing structures, easements, wetlands, watercourses, and wooded areas, properly labeled.
4) Approximate contours of the existing surface of land, with intervals adequate to indicate drainage and grades.

CHAP
CHAPTER V TER V -- INSURANCE, BOND REQUIREMENTS,INSURANCE, BOND REQUIREMENTS, CERTIFICATE OF CERTIFICATE OF USE, BOND RELEASE, ANDUSE, BOND RELEASE, AND AGREEMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF AGREEMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTSIMPROVEMENTS
SECTION 1. INSURANCE
a) The subdivider shall file with the Commission, on a form provided by the Town, a general liability insurance policy. This policy shall have a term no less than that of the Performance Bond and shall be extended in conformance with any extension of the Performance Bond.
b) The policy shall insure the Town of Coventry and the subdivider against all claims for damage or injury to persons or property that may arise from the construction, installation, or maintenance, or lack thereof, of any subdivision improvements, or from any operations in the development or completion of the subdivision, including but not limited to clearing, removal of vegetation, grading, excavating, filling, inspection, testing, well installation, sediment and erosion control measures, and road construction and improvement. The policy shall have the following limits:
Property Damage (including automobile)
Each Accident: Not less than $1 million
Bodily Injury (including automobile)
Each Person: Not less than $1 million
Each Accident: Not less than $1 million
Page 25 of 57
SECTION 2. PERFORMANCE BOND
a) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 2 below, a Performance Bond in such form and amount as the Commission may require in accordance with these Regulations may be posted by the subdivider prior to the sale or transfer of any lot to insure the completion of required improvements and utilities in the event the subdivider shall fail timely to install the same. The term of any Performance Bond proposed by the developer should be the same as the normal duration of the subdivision approval pursuant to state law. Any developer who proposes to submit a Performance Bond having a shorter term shall be deemed to have accepted the risk that the Bond will not be renewed and that the approval of the subdivision may lapse and become null and void if it is not renewed. The developer shall be entitled to complete all required subdivision improvements within the time allowed by state law, provided the developer continuously maintains the Performance Bond, or a substitute Performance Bond acceptable to and approved by the Commission in accordance with these Regulations, for the full duration of such time. If, at any time, the Performance Bond lapses, is terminated or withdrawn, or ceases to be effective or in force, regardless of whether the developer is responsible for such circumstances, the subdivision approval shall lapse and become null and void except as provided hereafter. Within 30 days after the date of any such lapse, termination, withdrawal, or cessation of the effectiveness of any such Performance Bond, the developer may submit to the Commission a written request for approval of a substitute Performance Bond. No such request shall be granted unless the developer or a designated agent or representative of the developer attends the meeting of the Commission at which the matter is to be considered. It shall be the developers responsibility to determine the date of such meeting. The Commission may deny such request if it determines that such proposed substitute Performance Bond does not provide adequate security for the timely completion of all required subdivision improvements and utilities or if it determines that the developer has failed to comply with any terms or conditions of the subdivision approval or any of these Regulations that are applicable to the subdivision approval. The Commission may also approve the provision of a substitute Performance Bond different in form and amount than that requested by the developer. In the event the Commission approves the provision of a substitute Performance Bond, the developer shall be allowed 30 days following the date of such approval to submit the substitute Performance Bond. The Commission may, upon the developers written request, extend the time within such substitute Performance Bond may be provided by no more than an additional 30 days. If the developer fails to provide the substitute Performance Bond within such period of 30-60 days, or if the developer fails to submit a written request for approval of a substitute Performance Bond within the time set for above, the subdivision approval shall become immediately and irrevocably null and void. Nothing in this section will prevent or prohibit subsequent subdivision of the property.
b) Separate Sedimentation and Erosion Control Bond: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, measures and facilities specified on the approved Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, and to restore the site in the event of termination or lapse in the subdivision approval shall be guaranteed by a separate soil erosion and sediment control
Page 26 of 57
performance bond (the Erosion and Sediment Control Bond). No disturbance of the site shall commence until such Erosion and Sediment Control Bond shall be posted. In the event the developer fails to maintain proper sedimentation and erosion controls on the subdivision site, the security required under this section may be used by the Town to stabilize eroding areas, remove sediment, and otherwise correct sedimentation and erosion problems on site at the sole discretion of the Commission or its designated agent.
c) Restoration: In the event either an Erosion and Sediment Control Bond and/or a Performance Bond has been posted and the subdivision approval terminates or lapses before all required subdivision improvements and utilities have been completed, the Commission may, in its discretion, and subject to any contrary provisions of state law, use the funds available in the Performance Bond or Erosion and Sediment Control Bond to restore all or any portion of the site to a natural condition. The Commission shall not use the Performance Bond to restore the site if the cost to complete all required improvements and utilities would be less than the cost of performing such restoration. The Commission shall not make any decision to use a Performance Bond for restoration without obtaining an estimate for the costs of both restoration and completion of all required improvements and utilities from the Town Engineer or a similarly qualified consultant.
d) Conditional Approval: In lieu of the completion and acceptance of public improvements prior to the endorsement and filing of final subdivision plans, the Commission may accept a Performance Bond as specified in paragraph (a) above and the Commission may authorize the filing of a plan with a conditional approval endorsed thereon. Such conditional approval shall allow for the construction, maintenance and installation of improvements or utilities required by the Commission and shown on the approved plan in connection with road construction, subject to the following conditions:
1) No work shall be commenced on or within the subdivision unless the developer provides an Erosion and Sediment Control Bond and a Performance Bond, satisfactory to the Commission in form and amount, in accordance with the following standards. The Erosion and Sediment Control Bond and the Performance Bond shall be adequate to secure (i) the installation and maintenance of all sedimentation and erosion control measures and facilities specified on the approved Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, and (ii) the cost of restoring the site to its natural condition if the developer fails to complete all required subdivision improvements and utilities. If the developer elects to submit a Preliminary Performance Bond, the following conditions shall apply:
2) In addition, the following conditions shall apply:
(A) A subdivision with conditional approval may be developed in phases, provided that no more than 1,200 feet of roadway and supporting improvements shall be under construction at one time without the posting of a performance bond. Before commencing development of any additional phases, all work required in the previous phase must be complete or a performance bond in place covering the work remaining in such prior phase.
Page 27 of 57
(B) The applicant shall guarantee in writing that no lots will be sold, no zoning or building permits will be sought and no individual lot development including tree clearing and grading will commence unless and until full security for completion of all remaining work shown on the plan is posted with the Commission. Violation of this provision shall be grounds for revocation of the subdivision approval.
3) Any such conditional approval shall lapse on such date as established by the Commission, but in no event shall the date be later than five years from the date such approval is granted. The applicant may apply for and the Commission may grant a renewal of such conditional approval for such period as the Commission in its discretion may establish provided that the total period of all such extensions does not exceed the maximum duration of a subdivision approval under State law.
e) In computing the amount of an Erosion and Sediment Control Bond and a Performance Bond, the Commission shall consider the following items:
1) The construction cost of all required improvements, including storm drainage system, roads and pavements, sidewalks and curbs, trees, grading, setting of monuments, and any other requirements made as a condition for subdivision approval or depicted on the endorsed Final Subdivision Plan, Plan and Profile, and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan.
2) The cost of restoring the site if the subdivision improvements are not completed. The following assumptions will be considered for the calculation of the restoration bond: The entire limits of road construction have been disturbed; that the value of grading is equal to 25% of the total earthwork volume; that stockpiled topsoil is available on site for respreading over disturbed areas; that all areas are to be seeded; and that supplemental erosion control measures are provided. [amended effective 12/14/98]
3) Costs for the Town to advertise and award a contract for erosion and sediment control measures for construction of the improvements or site restoration.
4) Costs shall be projected to a point at the end of the Performance Bond term. Any extension of the term of the Performance Bond may result in an adjustment as to the Bond total.
5) The total estimated cost of the Performance Bond shall also include a 15% addition to cover contingencies and engineering and 10% inflation factor.
6) Where a subdivision is to be developed in phases, the subdivider may petition the Commission in writing for permission to post a Performance Bond covering the costs itemized in paragraphs (e) 1 through 5 above, related to those improvements and utilities located within or required to serve one or more phases rather than for the entire development. Similar permission shall be obtained by the subdivider prior to commencing development of any or all additional phases. Where the subdivider bonds in phases as authorized in this paragraph, no improvement, as that
Page 28 of 57
term is defined in these Regulations, shall be commenced in any phase for which no bond has been posted. [amended effective 12/14/98]
f) The amount of the Erosion and Sediment Control Bond and the Performance Bond shall be the sum which the Commission shall require. The completion date of all required improvements shall be as required by the Commission. The bond amount shall be calculated by the Town Engineer or his/her designee. The Commission shall accept cash bonds or financial guarantees other than surety bonds, including, but not limited to letters of credit, and the Commission may accept surety bonds.
g) As used in these Regulations, the term Performance Bond shall refer to one of the following methods of assuring completion of Subdivision Improvements:
1) Cash or Payment in the form of a certified check. The issuing bank (Surety) shall be one maintaining offices in Tolland County in the State of Connecticut.
2) A Letter of Credit in favor of the Town in the form provided by the Commission. Such Letter of Credit shall be issued only by a bank or comparable lending institution maintaining offices in the State of Connecticut.
3) A surety bond that meets the following requirements:
i) The surety issuing the bond shall be one approved by the Commission based on a list of approved surety companies that the Commission may, by resolution, approve from time to time. The Commission may by resolution, in its sole discretion add or remove surety compaies based on the performance of such companies in Coventry or any other municipality. The Commission may by resolution use a list of approved surety companies published by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities or any other statewide organization selected by the Commission.
ii) The surety company shall maintain permanent offices within the State of Connecticut.
iii) The surety bond agreement shall contain the following provisions:
a) That payment shall be made in full within sixty five (65) days of written demand by the Commission or its agent, and
b) that failure to make full payment within such time shall automatically and without further demand result in a penalty of one percent (1%) of the total outstanding bond for each calendar month or part thereof that such payment is delayed past the date of demand and
c) that if litigation is required to collect said surety bond, the surety company shall pay to the Commission the costs thereof, inclusing witness fees, court entry fees, and any other costs and expenses of such litigation, and
d) the surety company shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Commission and the Town of Coventry against any and all claims of damage or injury sustained upon, or as a result of the incomplete public improvements during the period following the demand for payment on said surety bond and for restoration of any damage or deterioration (including but not limited to, erosion and sedimentation damages) resulting from such delay in payment, and
e) such other provisions as the Commissions legal counsel shall require.
Page 29 of 57
iv) The Power of Attorney of person signing on behalf of the Surety Company must be attached to the Bond if not already on file with the Commission. If the person acting as attorney for the Surety Company is not a licensed resident agent of the State of Connecticut, then this Bond shall be countersigned by a licensed Connecticut resident agent of the Company. The Company shall appeal on the Department of the Treasury Federal Registry Circular 570.
v) The signatures of two (2) witnesses are required on the Bond. If the subdivision applicant is a corporation, then the corporate seal must be shown in addition to the seal of the Bonding Company, and a corporate resolution must be provided indicating that the corporate officer executing the bond has authority to do so. If the subdivision applicant is a partnership, then a partnership resolution must be provided indicating that the partner executing the bond has authority to do so. [amended effective 12/14/98]
vi) The Bond must show the bond number and the name of the Bonding Company's local agent.
vii) If at any time, the bond required by this Section shall not be in effect for incomplete or unaccepted public improvements, the Commission may file a caveat on the Land Records warning potential purchasers of such fact. [added effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 3. CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE
Before any Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for any building in such subdivision on a lot that fronts on a subdivision road that has not been accepted by the Town as a public road, the subdivider must complete such road, in accordance with all applicable specifications, up to the farther side line of such lot, to a stage in construction at which only final surfacing of the road remains to be done before completion of the road. The foregoing condition shall not apply to street trees, sidewalks, or other types of road-related improvements not required for vehicular travel, but shall apply to the installation of street name signs to facilitate the provision of emergency services. The balance of the work on such road, and all other public improvements, must also be bonded in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter V. In addition, water supplies and effluent disposal systems shall be operational and accepted by the appropriate Town or State agencies prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance allowing the occupancy of a dwelling on any lot. [amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 4. APPLICATION OF BONDS
The Commission may call any Erosion and Sediment Control Bond or Performance Bond and apply the proceeds of such bond to the construction and installation of required subdivision improvements and utilities in any of the following circumstances:
a) The Commission may call the bond at any time within sixty (60) days before the
Page 30 of 57
expiration or termination date of the bond, as that date may have been extended, if any portion of the required subdivision improvements or utilities has not been completed. If the Commission has called the bond under this subsection, and the expiration or termination date of the bond is subsequently extended for a period of no less than one (1) additional year, or a replacement bond of equivalent or greater amount is subsequently provided in a form satisfactory to the Commission, the Commission shall have the option of proceeding to complete any portion of the required subdivision improvements and utilities under the original bond or accepting the extended or replacement bond in lieu of completing such improvements.
b) The Commission may call the bond at any time within sixty (60) days before the date, as it may have been extended, on which the approval of the subdivision is scheduled to expire under any applicable provision of state or local law if any portion of the required subdivision improvements or utilities has not been completed.
c) The Commission may call the bond at any time to complete any portion of the required improvements or utilities the Commission deems reasonably necessary to serve any lots within the subdivision that have been sold or otherwise conveyed.
ANY PERSON WHO SUBMITS AN APPLICATION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF A SUBDIVISION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF A BOND IN LIEU OF THE COMPLETION OF ALL REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED ALL OF THE FOREGOING TERMS. THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT ISSUE ANY FINAL APPROVAL OF A SUBDIVISION APPLICATION BASED UPON THE PROVISION OF A BOND UNLESS THE APPLICANT AGREES TO ABIDE BY THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS.
SECTION 5. BOND RELEASE
a) Prior to the release of the Performance Bond the subdivider shall present a Maintenance Bond equal to ten (10%) percent of the full amount (i.e., the highest amount set by the Commission before any subsequent reductions) of the Performance Bond. The Maintenance Bond shall be for a period of one (1) year and shall guarantee the improvements installed against defects in materials or workmanship, or damage caused to the improvements by any construction activity in the subdivision. The one-year period shall commence upon the effective date of the acceptance of any road or other public improvements by that agency having authority for such acceptance.
b) Application for the release or reduction of any Performance Bond upon completion of all required improvements shall include the submission of properly scaled as-built drawings, which shall include all changes in the plans as authorized by the Commission or the Engineer during the course of construction. The as-built drawings shall be signed and sealed by a Connecticut Registered Land Surveyor licensed in the State of Connecticut.
c) Upon submission of a written report from the Engineer that all or a certain specified stage in the construction of improvements has been satisfactorily completed, the developer may request that the Commission reduce any outstanding bond to reflect the cost of
Page 31 of 57
construction of the remaining improvements. Such reductions shall be made within sixty-five (65) days of the developers request. The Commission may refuse such reductions if it finds the construction of any improvements in violation of any provision of these Regulations or the plans, terms, or conditions for any subdivision approved hereunder.
SECTION 6. AGREEMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS
An application for approval of a subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of public improvements shall constitute an agreement by the subdivider to be personally responsible for the completion of any portions of the improvements the Commission may deem necessary to serve any lots that may be conveyed following approval of the plan. The Commissions ability to call a subdivision bond or other surety pursuant to CT General Statute Section 8-26c ( c) shall not prevent the Commission from seeking to enforce the personal responsibility of the applicant to complete the necessary improvements.
The Commission shall not approve any subdivision plan that involves the construction or installation of public improvements unless the applicant signs an agreement acknowledging the foregoing personal responsibilities. The form of such agreement shall be as set forth on Page 51 of these Regulations.

4) The physical characteristics of the property through which the street is proposed, such as topography, surface geology, water table, and the like;
5) The recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development.
[preceding added effective 12/14/98]
e) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street that does not comply with the specified width requirements, the owner shall dedicate the necessary area to the Town for street widening and the applicant shall show such widening on the Formal Subdivision Plan.
[amended effective 1/1/77; amended effective 12/14/98]
f) Cul-de-sac Streets. A cul-de-sac street shall not originate at a loop street.
When a cul-de-sac is proposed as a temporary measure pending future development of adjoining property, it shall be so designed as to be feasible of continuation in the adjacent tract.
When there is a possibility of extension of a street, all portions of the cul-de-sac, including pavement, grass strip, and sidewalk that fall outside of the limits of the normal right-of-way width shall occupy the space by virtue of an easement delivered to the Town before acceptance of the street.
The applicant (subdivider) extending a street from a cul-de-sac shall be required to remove the existing pavement outside of the standard traveled way, loam and seed the area in which
Page 33 of 57
pavement has been removed and install curbs and sidewalks, extend existing driveways and relocate mail and paper boxes in the original cul-de-sac area in accordance with Town requirements and all at the applicant (subdividers) own expense. [amended effective 12/14/98]
[amended effective 6/30/85; amended effective 12/14/98]
g) Loop Streets. Loop streets shall not originate at another loop street or a cul-de-sac street. Loop streets shall not provide access to more than twenty (20) lots.
No lots within the loop shall have its rear line fronting on the street.
[amended effective 6/30/85; amended effective 12/14/98]
h. Half Streets. The dedication of half streets at the perimeter of a new subdivision is prohibited.
[amended effective 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
i) Slope Rights. Where new streets abut private property, necessary slope rights shall be obtained by the applicant when in cut or fill, and these slope rights shall be shown on the final layout submission to the Commission. The applicant shall investigate the effect of cuts or fills on adjacent private property within the slope right areas. The applicant shall provide the Town with evidence that no drainage problems or other problems will arise on adjacent property due to construction or fill operations.
[amended effective 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
j) Existing Street Improvements/Access. Whenever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing Town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width and construction set forth in these Regulations, and the Commission determines that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision, the Commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street by and at the expensive of the subdivider. [amended effective 1/28/77; and 12/14/98]
In making the determination set forth in the preceding paragraphs, the Commission shall take into account the streets ability to handle the increased volumes of traffic which will be generated by the proposed subdivision, the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely, the drainage conditions of the street, and generally the ability of any vehicle to use the street safely. [amended effective 6/20/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
k) Scenic Roads; Stone Walls. Frontage improvements, as described in the preceding section, may be modified by the Commission in order to achieve the objectives of the Coventry

The subdivider shall make all necessary arrangements with the service utility to provide the underground services. The method of installation shall be approved by the particular utility company and be in conformance with the utility location requirements of these Regulations. The Commission may waive all or part of these requirements of these Regulations in accordance with Chapter X. [amended 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 3. LOTS
a) If the owner of a proposed subdivision also owns adjacent land that cannot be independently subdivided into lots meeting the requirements of the Regulations, such adjacent land must be incorporated into the proposed subdivision. The Commission shall not approve any subdivision containing one or more fragments or parcels that would not meet the minimum requirements for a developable lot unless such fragments or parcels expressly intended to be dedicated to a public use acceptable to the Commission. [amended 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
b) No lot, regardless of size, which is rendered useless for building due to utility easements, right-of-way, watercourses-topography, or lack of compliance with the Public Health Code, shall be shown as building lots on any subdivision. Except as provided in Subsection (a), such property shall be included in adjoining lots. [amended 06/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
c) On lots located on the outside of sharp curves and cul-de-sacs the Commission may allow the frontage requirements to be applied at the building line instead of the street line. Each lot for which such frontage measurement is sought shall be individually identified in the subdivision application form and on the Formal Subdivision Plan. [amended 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
d) On corner lots the lot dimensions may be determined from the point of intersection of the two (2) street lines. If the streets have a curved line of intersection, the lot dimensions may be determined from the point at which the street lines would have intersected if each had been continued as a straight line. [amended 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
Page 35 of 57
e) Side lines of lots shall, insofar as practicable, be either at right angles or radial to street lines. Variations from this rule will be made only where it is impractical to do otherwise, and shall require approval in accordance with Chapter V of these Regulations. [amended 6/30/85; and amended effective 12/14/98]
f) Space shall be provided on all lots for off-street parking. [amended 6/30/85; and amended12/14/98]
g) Lot Boundary Markers. A lot boundary marker shall be placed by the subdividers surveyor on each lot corner and also at any point where a chance of a lot line occurs. Such marker may be a steel rod, iron pin, drill hole, or other equally permanent method and it shall be clearly marked with an indelible paint. The permanent marker location shall be shown on the final
subdivision map and must be placed on the site prior to the issuance of a final Certificate of
Use and Compliance on the subject lot. Upon the specific request of the applicant in the subdivision application form, the commission may waive this requirement on extraordinarily large lots or remaining tracts of property in accordance with Chapter X of these Regulations. [amended 7/18/77; and amended effective 12/14/98]
h) Lot Size. To ensure that all proposed subdivision lots have an adequate area for on-site water and sewerage systems, house and accessory building locations, driveways and parking area and usable recreation space; to minimize drainage problems and facilitate ground water discharge; and to minimize potentially detrimental encroachments upon watercourses, waterbodies, wetland soils and flood plain areas; all proposed subdivision lots, except as otherwise permitted under the Coventry Zoning Regulations, shall comply with the Minimum Buildable Area requirements of the Zoning Regulations. [added 10/1/79; and amended effective 12/14/98]
i) Common Driveways Shall Be Allowed, Provided:
1. The driveway serves no more than three dwellings or, in the case of loop driveways, no more than five dwellings.
2. The appropriate construction standards are met (See Section 6).
3. A driveway easement is filed on the deeds of the affected lots to clearly establish liability and maintenance agreements. Said deed restriction shall be approved by the Town of Coventry Planning staff and filed on the land records prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Use and Compliance on any of the subject lots. [added/amended effective 12/14/98]
CHAPTER VII
CHAPTER VII -- WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SUPPLY AND SANITARY WASTE DISPOSALSANITARY WASTE DISPOSAL
Page 36 of 57
SECTION 1. WATER SUPPLY
a) Every proposed lot must be suitable for the installation of an adequate water supply consisting of a drilled well, artesian well or community water supply. Where evidence before the Commission indicates that water supply may not be adequate, whether because of poor quality, insufficient quantity or other reason, the subdivider may be required to submit additional information demonstrating the adequacy, quality and quantity of the proposed water supply. Such information shall be submitted to the Town Director of Health or other appropriate Town official for review and comment. The Commission may also require the installation of test wells in one or more locations prior to issuing approval of any Final Subdivision Plan.
b) If the use of a community water supply system is proposed, the subdivider shall submit a plan in compliance with, evidence of an approval by the Town Director of Health. [See also, Chapter III, Section 3(a)(ix)]
SECTION 2. SANITARY WASTE DISPOSAL
a) No lot requiring an individual septic system for sewage disposal shall be considered for approval by the Commission until the lot has been approved by the Town Director of Health, Town Sanitarian, or other appropriate Town official as suitable for the system. Percolation tests, soil reports, and the relevant Town officials report must be submitted with the Subdivision Application. Where evidence indicates special cause for concern, the Commission may require additional information in applications, including, but not limited to, a permeability analysis and/or renovation analysis of bacteria, phosphates, or other pollutants. [amended effective 1214/98]
b) It is the responsibility of the subdivider to contact the Town Director of Health or Town Sanitarian to prove that the lot area is adequate to permit the installation and operation of an individual sewage disposal system. The subdivider shall provide the necessary equipment and labor for the making of any and all tests required by Town health officials. When Town health approval is given subject to conditions, such conditions shall be noted on the record map.
c) A minimum of one (1) deep observation hole and percolation test shall be performed in each proposed primary, and in each proposed reserve, septic system area indicated on the subdivision plans. [added effective 12/14/98]
CHAPTER VIII
CHAPTER VIII -- OPEN SPACES AND RECREATION AREASOPEN SPACES AND RECREATION AREAS
SECTION 1. DISPOSITION
For any subdivision of land under these Regulations, the Commission may require of the subdivider the disposition and official dedication of appropriately located and sized open space or recreation areas. For the purpose of this Chapter VIII, "open space or recreation areas" shall
Page 37 of 57
be defined to include, but not be limited to, areas left in their natural, undisturbed state; agricultural land for which development rights have been assigned or otherwise alienated in perpetuity; areas and facilities for non-commercial, non-profit recreation; and similar areas for wildlife habitat, passive and active recreation, groundwater recharge, scenic preservation, and the like. In determining the appropriateness of an open space and/or recreation area disposition, the Commission shall consider Plan of Conservation and Development objectives and map designations and the subject site's characteristics with respect to the following objectives: the conservation and protection of wildlife and natural or scenic resources including lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, streambelts, inland wetlands, aquifers, significant woodlands, ridges, ravines, ledge outcroppings and other unusual physical features; the protection of productive agricultural soil, the protection of historic or archeological sites; the expansion of existing open space,
recreational areas, and greenways and the meeting of neighborhood and/or community-wide recreational needs. The Commission reserves the right to select that portion of the proposed subdivision to be dedicated for open space or recreational purposes, and it may reject or modify any area proposed by the applicant. [amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 2. SIZE
Where open space and/or recreation area disposition is deemed appropriate, the size of the required areas shall be determined by the Commission based on the site's value and importance in meeting the objectives cited in Chapter VIII, Section 1 and the scope of the subdivision proposal. Required open space and/or recreation areas shall ordinarily be a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the area of the property under consideration. Based on the site's value with respect to the objectives cited in Chapter VIII, Section 1, up to twenty percent (20%) of the area of the property under consideration may be required by the Commission. However, in no case may the fair market value of the land or interests which the Commission requires the owner to dedicate exceed ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the total subdivision area as measured prior to subdivision approval. In the event the Commission elects to have the applicant dedicate a portion of the proposed subdivision that is proportionately more valuable than the remainder of the subdivision, the Commission may require the dedication of less than ten percent (10%) of the area of the subdivision if the area to be dedicated would have a fair market value approximately equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided as measured prior to subdivision approval. In determining the total land to be reserved as open space and/or recreation land, the Commission may consider not only the tract or tracts of land to be immediately subdivided, but also any other adjacent tract or tracts owned, controlled or under agreement to buy or optioned by the subdivider. Areas to be reserved as open space and/or recreation land shall be shown on the subdivision map.
SECTION 3. SITES OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
a) In all subdivisions of five (5) acres or more, all applicants shall make written inquiry of the office of State Archaeologist to determine if there is existing evidence or a reason to believe evidence exists of sites of archaeological significance within the subdivision. Such inquiry shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested. Proof of such mailing shall be provided to the Commission at the time of submitting the subdivision
Page 38 of 57
application. Any significant sites shall, where possible, be left undisturbed and may be considered in meeting the minimum open space requirements of this Chapter. If no reply from the State Archaeologist is received within 30 days after receipt of the notice, it shall be presumed that the State Archaeologist has determined that the area is not located within an area of archaeological significance. [added effective 12/14/98]
b) The Commission may require an environmental assessment where it determines that the subdivision may contain significant natural and/or cultural resources, based on the National Resources Inventory, Conservation Commission, Open Space Report, Plan of Conservation and Development, State Archaeologists report, or other pertinent information reviewed by the Commission.
SECTION 4. METHOD OF DISPOSITION
The Commission shall determine the most appropriate method of disposition after considering, among other things, the relationship of the subject area(s) and its specific characteristics to the Plan of Conservation and Development and the objectives cited in Chapter VIII, Section 1; the desirability and suitability of public access and use and the scope of the subdivision proposal. The following disposition options may be utilized by the Commission:
a) Perpetual dedication to the Town.
b) Perpetual dedication to the State of Connecticut for open space or recreational purposes.
c) Perpetual dedication to a land trust (at the option of the subdivider), as long as the land trust has agreed to accept the dedication. [amended effective 12/14/98]
d) Dedication to a homeowners' association for open space or recreational purposes (see Chapter VIII, Section 8).
e) Utilization of conservation easement(s), with or without public access.
f) Utilization of a recreation easement, to the Town, State, or a private non-profit entity.
g) Utilization of an agricultural use restriction easement, to the Town, State, or a private, non-profit entity.
h) Private ownership for open space purposes with the appropriate taking of development rights.
i) Any combination of the above or any suitable alternative approved by the Commission.
Any conservation easements or other open space covenants or restrictions shall be subject to the approval of the Commission in form and content. [added effective 12/14/98]
Page 39 of 57
SECTION 5. REFERRALS
The Commission may refer for review and comment any subdivision plan and proposal for the provision of open spaces and/or recreation land to the Conservation Commission, Recreation Commission, Tolland County Soil and Water Conservation District, or any other appropriate agency.
SECTION 6. CONDITION OF OPEN SPACES AND/OR RECREATION LAND
a) Land to be provided as open space for the purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife and natural or scenic resources shall be left in a natural state by the subdivider unless otherwise specified by the Commission. Except for such improvements as may be required by the Commission, open space areas shall not be graded, cleared or used as a repository for brush, stumps, earth, building materials or debris.
b) Open space and/or recreation areas shall typically abut or have direct public access to a public street and, as appropriate, any existing park or public land. The Commission may require access areas to be graded and improved in a manner suitable for safe pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic. Access roadways shall have an adequate base, shall be adequately drained and shall typically be twenty feet (20') wide and have a slope no greater than twelve percent (12%). [relocated - The Commission may require that any land to be dedicated for recreational use be cleared of brush, trees, and debris; be graded to properly dispose of surface water; be covered with organic topsoil to a depth of four inches (4); be seeded with low maintenance grass seed and be otherwise improved so that the land is left in a condition appropriate to the intended use.]
c) When site improvements are required, they shall be clearly shown on the final subdivision maps or alternatively on a separate site improvements plan and they shall be approved by the Commission prior to the filing of the subdivision plan.
d) The boundary lines of all areas to be dedicated shall be set in the field and marked by Commission-approved plaques where such lines intersect any lot line, road, or perimeter line within the proposed subdivision and at such other points as may be required by the Commission to ensure identification in the field.
SECTION 7. ENFORCEMENT BONDING
To ensure proper construction of any required improvements in areas to be dedicated pursuant to this Chapter VIII, the Commission shall require the subdivider to include in the performance bond an amount sufficient to ensure completion of such improvements. All required improvements of open space and/or recreation land shall be completed prior to the sale of more than fifty percent (50%) of the lots within the subdivision. [amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 8. HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION
Page 40 of 57
The Commission may, upon the request of the subdivider, permit the ownership and maintenance of the open space and/or recreation area to be transferred to an association of property owners. The document providing for such transfer must:
a) Establish a mandatory participation in an association of property owners to maintain the land reservation for open space, park, and/or playground purposes, with power to assess all members for all necessary costs.
b) Be binding on all future property owners.
c) Be perpetual.
d) Not be affected by any change in zoning or land use.
e) Assure adequate maintenance.
f) Provide for enforcement by the Town by appropriate legal action.
g) Provide that if maintenance or preservation of the dedication no longer comply with the provisions of the document, the Town may take all necessary action to assure compliance and assess against the association all costs incurred by the Town for such purposes.
h) Comply with the Connecticut Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA) and other relevant state laws and regulations.
After approval by the Town Attorney and Commission, the document shall be filed by the subdivider in the Office of the Town Clerk.
SECTION 9. LEGAL TRANSFER
Properly executed legal documents, including warranty deeds for any title transfer, shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter VIII and shall be submitted in triplicate with the final subdivision map to be filed. All documents must be acceptable to the Town Attorney and Planning Staff and shall refer to the subdivision maps by title. All warranty deeds for dedication of land to the Town shall be held in escrow by the Commission to be recorded on the Town Land Records upon acceptance by the Town Council. In the event that acceptance is rejected by the Town Council, the deed shall be returned and the subdivider shall return to the Commission for determination of an alternative means of preserving the open space and/or recreation areas. In no case shall the acceptance of any deed by the Commission or an employee of the Town prior to Town Council approval be deemed as acceptance of the open space and/or recreation area by the Town. [amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 10. DEDICATION FOR OTHER MUNICIPAL PURPOSES
In the event the subdivider proposes to transfer to the Town land for municipal purposes other
Page 41 of 57
than open space or recreation, the Commission may, in its discretion, approve such dedication as a credit toward any open space and/or recreational area disposition requirements under this Chapter VIII.
SECTION 11. FEE IN LIEU OF OPEN SPACE
As set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission may, at the option of the applicant, authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the Town, or pay a fee to the Town and transfer land to the Town in lieu of the full requirement to provide open space as set forth above. Such authorization may be granted by the Commission if and when it determines, in its sole discretion, that conditions such as subdivision size, population densities, existing open space in the neighborhood, topography, soils, or other characteristics are such that on-site open space is not as desirable as a fee-in-lieu of open space.
a) Amount: Such fee or combination of fee and the fair market of land transferred shall be equal to not more than ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant, with the cost of all appraisal fees and expenses borne by the applicant.
b) Procedure: To employ the fee-in-lieu of open space option, the following procedures shall be used:
1) The applicant shall submit to the Commission a written proposal to pay a fee or transfer land to the Town in lieu of providing open space.
2) The Commission shall determine whether it is willing to consider the applicants proposal further, or whether it would be willing to consider a different combination of land transfer and fee. The Commissions determination at this stage shall not be binding on either the Commission or the applicant.
3) If the Commission and applicant agree on further consideration of a fee, transfer of land, or both, they shall jointly select an appraiser to submit a report.
Steps 1) through 3) may be accomplished as part of the consideration of a Preliminary Layout, or at the time of acceptance of a Formal Subdivision application.
4) The applicant shall submit the appraisal prior to the completion of the Commissions review of the Formal Subdivision application. If the Commission holds a public hearing on the application, the applicant must submit the appraisal before the close of the public hearing.
5) The Commission, as part of the action on the application, may either accept the fee-in-lieu proposal or a combination of fee and land transfer proposal, or it may require an open space dedication.
Page 42 of 57
c) Payment: The method of payment of any fees under this Section shall be one of the following two options:
1) The applicant, at his option, may submit the entire fee in one lump sum prior to the filing of the approved Final Subdivision mylars with the Town Clerk; or,
2) The applicant may elect to submit a fraction of such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved building lots in the subdivision, no later than the time of the sale of each approved building lot; and a notation describing this requirement shall be placed on the Final Subdivision map filed in the Town Clerks office. If this option is chosen, the applicant shall submit a bond or other security acceptable to the Town, equal to the full amount of fee required, prior to the filing of the subdivision maps in the Town Clerks office. Any required fees shall be paid to the Town prior to the release of this bond. The Commission may also choose other acceptable security such as a mortgage or lien on the land to be subdivided. This mortgage or lien shall secure the amount of the fee-in-lieu and provide for partial release of lots sold as the fractional part of the fee is paid.
3) No building permits shall be issued until such fractional part is paid as to any lot in the subdivision.
d) Dedicated Fund: Fees submitted under this section shall be deposited by the Town in a fund which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
SECTION 12. OPEN SPACE EXEMPTIONS
In accordance with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25, the following instances shall be exempt from the provisions of Chapter VIII Open Spaces and Recreation Areas:
a) where the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) lots is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first cousin of the property owner for no consideration. Such intended transfer shall be evidenced by covenants, restrictions, contracts, or other legally binding documents as the Commission may approve, which documents will be filed in the Land Records along with the Final Subdivision Plan. If the Commission determines, subsequent to the approval of such subdivision, that such transfers were intended to be temporary, and for the sole purpose of evading the requirements of this Section, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records; and
b) where the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in Section 8-39a of the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. Such restrictions for affordable housing shall be
Page 43 of 57
evidenced by such documents as the Commission may require, and such restrictions shall run with the lots affected thereby in perpetuity. If, subsequent to approval of the Subdivision, the lots designated for affordable housing shall not be sold for that purpose, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records.
CHAPTER IX
CHAPTER IX -- LOT LINE REVISIONSLOT LINE REVISIONS
SECTION 1. LOT LINE REVISION IN APPROVED SUBDIVISION PLANS
The revision of any lot line or lot lines shown in a subdivision plan that has been previously approved by the Commission shall be deemed to constitute a modification of the approved subdivision plan. Any and all such modifications must be reviewed and approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not hold a public hearing on any such proposed lot line revision unless the proposed revision would result in a resubdivision, as defined in Section 8-18 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Commission shall approve a proposed lot line revision unless it determines either (i) that one or more of the proposed reconfigured lots would not meet any applicable requirements of the Zoning Regulations, or (ii) that the proposed modification would result in a lot or lots that would be significantly more difficult to develop or use because of the location of such physical features as wetlands, watercourses, or steep or rocky areas within the reconfigured lot or lots.
SECTION 2. LOT LINE REVISIONS IN OTHER LOTS
The revision of lot lines for adjoining, legally existing lots that predate the enactment of subdivision regulations in the Town of Coventry or that were lawfully created without subdivision approval shall not be deemed to be a subdivision and shall not require the review or approval of the Commission unless such revision results in the creation of a greater number of lots or parcels than existed before the revision.
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X -- WAIVER OF REGULATIONSWAIVER OF REGULATIONS
[Chapter X, revised effective 08/01/11]
SECTION 1. PURPOSE OF WAIVERS
The Commission recognizes that each parcel of property is unique in location, dimensions, orientation, topography, etc., and the various factors in the design of subdivisions are variable with relation to each other and to the above characteristics of the property. Therefore, in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-26, the Commission may modify or waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such requirements as, in its judgment of the special circumstances and conditions, are not requisite to the interest of public health, safety and general welfare.
Page 44 of 57
SECTION 2. PROCEDURE FOR WAIVERS
a) Requests for waivers under this Chapter must be submitted in writing before the submission of any formal subdivision application. The Commission shall not grant any waiver with respect to a proposed subdivision after a formal application has been submitted for such subdivision.
b) Any request for a waiver under this Chapter shall be submitted in writing to the Commission, with a sufficient set of plans or other information to allow the Commission to determine whether such waiver should be granted. Any materials submitted by the applicant for purposes of requesting a waiver with respect to any subdivision shall be deemed to be part of the record for any later, formal application for such subdivision.
c) The Commission shall act upon any written request for a waiver by the earlier of (1) the date of the Commissions first regularly scheduled meeting after the day of submission of such request; or (2) 35 days after such submission. The applicant may grant extensions of time for the Commission to act upon such request. If the Commission fails to act upon such request within the time set forth herein, or within the period of any extension granted by the applicant, the request shall be deemed to have been denied.
d) The Commission shall not grant any waiver for any subdivision plan for which there has been no Preliminary Review pursuant to Chapter IV, Sections 1 and 2, of these Regulations.
SECTION 3. STANDARDS FOR WAIVERS
In considering a request to waive or modify any requirement for providing information under Chapter IV, Section 3, subsections (a) or (b), of these Regulations, the Commission may approve a waiver if it determines that it will not require such information to evaluate the application under the applicable standards of these Regulations. In considering a request to waive or modify any other requirement of these Regulations, the Commission shall only approve such waiver or modification upon a finding that all of the following conditions are met:
1) Conditions exist on the subject property which are not generally applicable to other land in the Town;
2) Said conditions would render the subject property, or some significant portion thereof, unusable for any viable use permitted in the subject zone if these Regulations were strictly applied;
3) Said conditions were not created by the property owner nor by his/her predecessor(s) in title;
4) The granting of the modification or waiver would be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these Regulations;
5) The granting of the modification or waiver would not have a significant adverse impact on adjacent properties' values, or the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be in violation of the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development, as the same may be amended from time to time.

The subdivision design standards set forth in this chapter are intended to fulfill the requirements of Section 8-25 and 22a-19 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and specifically to assure that land to be subdivided is of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety; that proper provision is made for water, drainage, and sewerage and, in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers, or other bodies of water subject to flooding, that proper provision is made for protective flood control measures; that proposed streets are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the Towns Plan of Conservation and Development, especially in regard to safe intersections with such
thoroughfares, and are so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs; that reasonable provision is made for the creation, maintenance, and preservation of open spaces, parks, and playgrounds; and that the design of any subdivision does not unreasonably pollute, impair, or destroy, or create an unreasonable risk of polluting, impairing, or destroying, the public in the air, water, or other natural or historic resources of the state.
SECTION 2. APPLICATION OF STANDARDS
a) Manner of Application. The standards set forth in this chapter, elsewhere in these Regulations, and in the current Plan of Conservation and Development shall be considered by the Commission in determining whether to approve, modify and approve, or deny any subdivision or resubdivision application. The Commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan in any manner it determines to be reasonably necessary to achieve compliance with such standards. Such modifications may include, without limitation, the adjustment of proposed lot lines; the adjustment of the locations or dimensions of proposed streets, rights-of-way, utilities, or other improvements; or the provision, or the adjustment of the proposed location, of any open-space area, park, or playground. Such modifications may also include the elimination, combination or merger of specific lots on the proposed subdivision plan if the Commission deems such modifications necessary to avoid unreasonably adverse impacts to specifically identified natural or historic resources or to avoid specifically identified health or safety hazards to landowners, pedestrians, drivers, or other persons making proper use of any land within the area of the subdivision.
b) Limitation of Modifications. For purposes of Section 2 (a), the term specifically identified shall apply only to natural resources, historic resources, or health or safety hazards that are specific to the subdivision application and land being reviewed. For example, the Commission may order the elimination or merger of a specific lot that is proposed to contain an inordinate percentage of inland wetlands or that would require a driveway to
enter a road at a point with particularly difficult sight lines. However, the Commission may
Page 47 of 57
not require a general reduction in the overall lot density on the basis of generalized health, safety, or environmental reasons if the lot density as proposed is consistent with the requirements of the current Zoning Regulations.
SECTION 3. PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARDS
The standards for the protection of public health shall be as set forth in Chapter VII of these Regulations, entitled Water Supply and Sanitary Waste Disposal.
SECTION 4. STANDARDS FOR OPEN SPACES, PARKS, AND PLAYGROUNDS
The standards for the provision of adequate open spaces, parks, and playgrounds shall be as set forth in Chapter VIII of these Regulations, entitled Open Spaces and Recreation Areas.
SECTION 5. STANDARDS FOR STREET DESIGN
The standards for the provision of adequate access and street systems include those set forth in Chapter VI of these Regulations, entitled Required Street Improvements and Design Criteria. In addition, the Commission shall apply the following standards:
a) All streets in a proposed subdivision plan shall be designed to allow their incorporation into a safe, practical and effective Town street and highway system. For example, when a subdivision is planned within an area of the Town that is largely undeveloped or sparsely developed, the Commission shall consider whether any proposed cul-de-sacs would compromise the Towns ability to provide for through roads as the area becomes more densely developed.
b) Street layouts shall be designed with reasonable consideration for future access to adjoining parcels of land. Cul-de-sacs shall be disfavored if adjoining undeveloped parcels should be more easily and practically developed by a through-road connection and if the use of cul-de-sacs would be likely to require emergency vehicles to traverse a substantially longer route to reach adjoining properties.
c) In approving a subdivision application, the Commission may require the dedication of land along existing Town streets if necessary to provide the street right-of-way with an adequate width.
[amended effective 12/14/98]
SECTION 6. STANDARDS FOR PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
The Commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan prior to approval if it deems such modifications(s) necessary to protect specifically identified natural resources such as, but not limited to:
Page 48 of 57
1) Inland wetlands or watercourses and their riparian zones;
2) Habitat of rare or endangered plant or animal species;
3) Significant stands of mature trees or particularly large or unusual trees;
4) Significant geological features, such as unusual rock outcroppings;
5) Vista points and undisturbed ridgelines;
6) Floodplains; and
7) High-yielding or potentially high-yielding aquifers.
SECTION 7. STANDARDS FOR PROTECTION OF HISTORIC RESOURCES
The standards for the protection of historic resources shall include those standards set forth in Chapter VIII, Section 3 of these Regulations, entitled Sites of Archaeological Significance. In addition, the Commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan prior to approval if it deems such modification(s) necessary to protect specifically identified historic resources such as, but not limited to:
1) Stone walls or fences;
2) Foundations or other evidence of historic settlements within the Town;
3) Native American or other burial grounds; and
4) Historic structures or landmarks, as defined by Section 22a-19a of the Connecticut General Statutes.[amended effective 12/14/98]
5) a) Subdivisions shall be designed to preserve all existing stone walls.
b) All existing stone walls that are required to be removed shall be re-used elsewhere on the property, such as lot lines, or used to enhance other stone walls on the site.
c) A deed restriction may be required by the Commission to preserve the stone walls or they may be subject to in a conservation easement or restriction. (Added effective 6/15/12)

CHAPTER XIII
CHAPTER XIII  NATURAL RESOURCE NATURAL RESOURCE -- OPEN SPACE OPEN SPACE DESIGN DESIGN SUBDIVISION SUBDIVISION REGULATIONSREGULATIONS
[Chapter XIII, Sections 1-8 revised - effective 08/01/11]
SECTION 1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Chapter is to (1) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural or scenic resources, (2) protect natural streams and water supplies, (3) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, and other significant natural features and landmarks, (4) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces, (5) enhance public recreation opportunities, (6) preserve historic sites, and (7) promote orderly urban or suburban development. These regulations are intended to provide for increased flexibility, balanced by increased control, in the development of land so as to facilitate the preservation of open space, natural resources, recreational uses, and community character.
Page 50 of 57
SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS
The following terms, as used in this Chapter XIII, shall have the meanings set forth thereafter:
Active Recreation: Recreational activities that require either (1) the use of a playing field or playground; (2) the installation of buildings or other structures; or (3) the substantial modification or grading of a tract of land.
Conventional Subdivision: A subdivision design in which all lots would meet the requirements of Table 4.04A of the Coventry Zoning Regulations.
Open Space Subdivision: A cluster development, as defined by Section 8-18 of the Connecticut General Statutes, in which one or more lots would not meet the minimum dimensional requirements of Table 4.04A of the Coventry Zoning Regulations, but which would satisfy the dimensional and open-space requirements, and all other applicable criteria, of Section 4.12 of the Coventry Zoning Regulations.
Passive Recreation: Recreational activities that do not require either (1) the use of a playing field or playground; (2) the installation of buildings or other structures; or (3) the substantial modification or grading of a tract of land. The installation of a building or structure in connection with a particular recreational activity shall not, in and of itself, cause the activity to be classified as "active" if the building or structure was not necessary to allow the activity to occur. For example, the installation of posts, signs, or water fountains along a hiking trail will not cause hiking to be deemed an active recreational use.
SECTION 3. USE OF OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISION DESIGN
a) General Requirement: Except as otherwise provided in Chapter X, every applicant proposing to subdivide a parcel of land must submit an open space subdivision plan that meets the requirements of this Chapter XIII and the other relevant provisions of these Regulations and the Coventry Zoning Regulations.
b) Waiver of Requirement. If the applicant wishes to have the Commission consider a conventional subdivision plan as an alternative to an open space subdivision plan, the applicant must request a waiver of the open space subdivision requirement pursuant to Chapter X. In such situations, the applicant must submit both an open space subdivision plan and the proposed, alternative, conventional subdivision plan so that the Commission may compare and contrast the two in light of the open space preservation policies set forth in these Regulations. The alternative conventional subdivision plan must conform to all other requirements contained in these Regulations and the Coventry Zoning Regulations. In determining whether to allow the submission of a conventional subdivision plan in lieu of an open space subdivision plan, the Commission shall consider whether an open-space subdivision plan may better protect the
Towns interests in health and public safety; water, sewerage and drainage; a harmonious, adequate and convenient system of streets; open spaces, parks and playgrounds; and other interests as set forth in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes and other applicable provisions of state law.
Page 51 of 57
c) Preliminary Review. In order to facilitate the Commissions consideration of the best form of subdivision for any parcel, the Commission recommends that, prior to the submission of an official application for subdivision approval, the applicant utilize the Preliminary Review option set forth in Chapter IV, Section 1 of these Regulations.
SECTION 4. GENERAL DENSITY LIMITATIONS
Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations, the maximum number of lots for an open space subdivision shall be determined, at the applicant's option, by either the Formula Method or the Yield Plan Method.
a) Formula Method. If the applicant chooses the Formula Method, the maximum number of lots shall not exceed the number resulting from dividing the total area of the parcel, subject to the exclusions stated hereafter, by the minimum lot size that would be permitted for a conventional subdivision in the applicable zoning district. The total area of the parcel, as measured for purposes of this section, shall exclude the following: (i) land that is not "buildable land," as defined in Section 2.02 of the Zoning Regulations, and (ii) existing and proposed streets and highways, easements and rights-of-way for vehicular access and utilities.
b) Yield Plan Method. If the applicant chooses the Yield Plan Method, the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations governing conventional subdivision lots. Although such yield plans shall be conceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs, they must be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout. Consequently, yield plans must identify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development, including, but not limited to, topographic contours, at a contour interval of no more than ten (10) feet; wetlands and watercourses; 100-year floodplains (Flood Zones A, as shown on FEMA maps); slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%); rock outcrops; and easements and rights-of-way affecting the parcel.
On lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility, soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated. The Commission may select a small percentage of lots (10 to 15%) to be tested, in areas considered to be marginal. If all tests on the sample lots meet applicable Public Health Code requirements, the applicant's other lots shall also be deemed suitable for septic systems, for the purpose of calculating total lot yield. However, if any of the sample lots fail, several others (of the Commission's choosing) shall be tested, until all the lots in a given sample pass.
SECTION 5. DENSITY BONUSES
In accordance with Section 4.12.03 of the Zoning Regulations, the maximum number of lots allowed under Chapter XIII, Section 4 of these Subdivision Regulations may be increased in one of the following ways:
Page 52 of 57
a) Open Space Maintenance Fund. The Commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. The density bonus granted under this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4 of this Chapter XIII. Any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcel to be subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either (i) the Town of Coventry or (ii) the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan. The amount of the fee shall be set by the following formula: [(CFMV/N) x (0.5 XL)], where CFMV is the cumulative fair market value of all of the buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, N is the total number of buildable lots or
parts resulting from the subdivision, and XL is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus. The value of CFMV shall, at the option of the applicant, be (i) the 100% value of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the Town Assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision approval, or (ii) determined by a licensed Connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the Commission, in which case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees.
b) Other Open Space Dedications. A density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space, meaning the amount of any open space acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this Chapter XIII. The additional open space may be within the parcel to be subdivided or elsewhere within the Town of Coventry. For each five acres of excess open space accepted by the Commission, one additional building lot shall be allowed, up to a maximum of fifteen-percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4 of this Chapter XIII. The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate excess open space shall be at the discretion of the Commission, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the Town's Plan of Conservation and Development and its determination as to the value of the excess land for any of the purposes described in Section 1 of this Chapter XIII.
c) Encouraging Affordable Housing. A density bonus shall be allowed for open space subdivisions, that provide affordable housing, as defined in Section 8-30g of the Connecticut General Statutes. For each affordable housing unit provided under this section, one additional lot shall be permitted, up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4 of this Chapter XIII. Affordable housing is herein defined as units to 'be sold or rented to families earning 70-120 percent of the county median income, adjusted for family size, as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
SECTION 6. OPEN SPACE PERCENTAGE AND USE LIMITATIONS
a) Minimum Percentage of Open Space. The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space shall be as required under Section 4.12 of the Coventry Zoning Regulations.
Page 53 of 57
b) Use of Open Space Areas. At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active recreation purposes, but no more than fifty percent (50%) shall be utilized for that purpose, in order to preserve a reasonable portion of natural areas on the site. The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant. The required open space may be used, without restriction, for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems, provided that no portion of such systems protrudes above grade. Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space, as may land within the rights-of-way for underground utility lines. However, land within the rights-of way of overhead power lines or other surface utility lines shall not be included in the minimum required open space. In determining whether the proposed locations and uses of open-space areas are acceptable, the Commission shall consider the potential impacts on nearby properties and on the neighborhood.
SECTION 7. DESIGN STANDARDS FOR OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISION
The dimensional requirements for lots in an open space subdivision shall be as specified in Section 4.12.05 of the Coventry Zoning Regulations. In designing an open space subdivision, the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in Section 1 of this Chapter XIII, the provisions and standards set forth in Chapter VIII of these Regulations, and the following factors (as set forth in Section 4.12.05 of the Zoning Regulations):
a) Dwelling units shall be grouped allowing a portion of the parcel to remain open.
b) The open space in any open space subdivision shall be located entirely within the subdivision and shall be in one contiguous piece, unless the Commission finds that the purposes of Section 4.12.01 of the Zoning Regulations would be more effectively served by separated parcels. The open space shall have suitable shape, dimension, character and location to promote the purposes specified in Section 4.12.01 of the Zoning Regulations.
c) When designing an open space subdivision the applicant must refer to the Town's Open Space Plan and plan the development in relation to the open space by first (1) locating the proposed open space; second, locating houses; third, locating roads; and, fourth, laying out lot configurations.
d) To the greatest extent feasible, lots shall be laid out to achieve the following objectives (listed below in order of priority, as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site):
1) To place septic systems on the most suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal (in unsewered areas only);
2) Within any woodland contained in the parcel, or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland (to reduce impact upon agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind, and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features);
3) In locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadway(s);
Page 54 of 57
4) On the least fertile soils for agricultural uses, and in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use;
5) In locations where the greatest number of units could be designed to take maximum advantage of solar heating opportunities.
e) Wherever possible, wetlands should be adjacent, contiguous or included in the Open Space.
f) Along any part of the parcel perimeter where down-sized lots abut normal-sized lots, the Commission may require a buffer zone up to fifty feet in width, thickly planted with fast-growing native shrubs and trees, or may require in such buffer zone the maintenance of existing natural vegetation.
g) Unless prevented by ledge or other natural restraints, underground utilities shall be required in open space subdivisions.
h) Proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved.
i) Proposed open space areas should include irreplaceable natural features located in the tract (such as, but not limited to stream beds, prime farmland agricultural soils, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, and rock outcroppings).
j) Open space intended for recreation or other active public use should be easily accessible to pedestrians, including, to the extent feasible, the handicapped and elderly.
k) Individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites, and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel.
The Commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed, if it determines that such modified location(s) will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these Regulations and the Zoning Regulations.
SECTION 8. DEDICATION OF OPEN SPACE
a) Method of Dedication. The Commission shall determine the most appropriate method of disposition after considering, among other things, the relationship of the subject area(s) and its specific characteristics to the Plan of Conservation and Development and the objectives cited in Chapter VIII, Section 1 of these Regulations; the desirability and suitability of public access and use; and the scope of the subdivision proposal. The following disposition options may be utilized by the Commission:
1) Perpetual dedication to the Town.
2) Perpetual dedication to the State of Connecticut for open space or recreational purposes.
Page 55 of 57
3) Perpetual dedication to a land trust (at the option of the subdivider), as long as the land trust has agreed to accept the dedication.
4) Dedication to a homeowners' association for open space or recreational purposes.
5) Utilization of conservation easement(s), with or without public access.
6) Utilization of a recreation easement, to the Town, State, or a private non-profit entity.
7) Utilization of an agricultural use restriction easement, to the Town, State, or a private, non-profit entity.
8) Private ownership for open space purposes with the appropriate taking of development rights.
9) Any combination of the above or any suitable alternative approved by the Commission.
Any conservation easements or other open space covenants or restrictions shall be subject to the approval of the Commission in form and content.
b) Agreement to Accept Ownership and Responsibility. If open space is to be owned by a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation, the State of Connecticut, the Town of Coventry, or another entity, the application shall contain written evidence from the proposed entity satisfactory to the Commission, stating that it is willing to accept ownership of and responsibility for the preservation and maintenance of the open space. Regardless of the manner of ownership of the open space, the instrument of conveyance must include provisions satisfactory in form and substance to the Commission to ensure:
1) The continued use of such land for the intended purposes;
2) The continuity of proper maintenance for those portions of the open space requiring maintenance;
3) When appropriate, the availability of funds required for such maintenance;
4) Adequate insurance protection; and
5) Recovery for loss sustained by casualty, condemnation or otherwise.
c) Boundary Markings. The boundary lines of all open space shall be set in the field and marked by permanent, readily-visible markers where such lines intersect any lot line, road or perimeter line within the proposed open space subdivision and at such other points as may be required by the Commission to insure identification in the field.
d) Recording of Documents. At the time the approved open space subdivision plan is filed, the applicant shall record on the Coventry Land Records all legal documents required to ensure the aforesaid guarantees.
Page 56 of 57
e) Right to Enforce. A right to enforce the Development Restriction shall be conveyed to:
1) The Town of Coventry, the State of Connecticut, or a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation dedicated to conservation or preservation purposes in cases where the open space is dedicated to an association or corporation of lot owners, or a private or governmental entity; or
2) To the association or corporation of lot owners in cases where open space is dedicated to the Town of Coventry, the State of Connecticut, or a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation.
Any deed of conveyance shall contain language providing the holder of the Development Restriction with the right to obtain reimbursement for all costs it reasonably incurs, including attorney's fees, in any action to enforce the Development Restriction, in which it is the prevailing party.
f) Association/Corporation Requirements. If the open space is proposed to be dedicated to an association or corporation of lot owners, then the Commission shall consider the following additional issues in determining whether to approve such proposal:
1) The increase in the burden imposed by the proposed open space subdivision on existing and proposed areas of open space.
2) Any relevant recommendations of the Town Council, the Inland Wetlands Agency, the Parks and Recreation Commission, the Conservation Commission, the Board of Finance, or any other public or private agencies or authorities regarding the most appropriate disposition and management of the open space.
3) The level of access to the areas of open space proposed to be afforded to members of the general public.
4) The manner in which the association would manage the open space, and the extent to which proper management would be assured;
In approving any proposed dedication of open space to an association or corporation, the Commission may set additional requirements to assure the proper and continuing management and oversight of the open space, including, but not limited to, the following:
1) Creation of the association or corporation prior to the sale of any lot;
2) Mandatory membership in the association or corporation by all original lot owners and any subsequent owner; and
3) Requiring the association or corporation to have the power to assess and collect from each lot owner a specified share of, and, where necessary, provide reserves for the costs associated with maintenance, repair, upkeep and insurance of the open space.
Page 57 of 57
SECTION 9. EXCEPTIONS
An applicant may apply to the Commission for an exception to the open space subdivision plan requirements. The purpose of the exception is to provide flexibility with regard to parcels of land for which an open space subdivision play would be impractical due to existing physical conditions or limitations, would create an undue hardship, or would be substantially detrimental to the charter of, or property values in, surrounding areas. In evaluating, approving or disapproving an application for such an exception, the Commission may consider the following criteria:
a) The nature of the proposed development.
b) The nature of the resources present on the land.
c) The size of the subdivision.
d) Road access.
e) The shape of the parcel.
f) Any undue hardships that the creation of an open space subdivision would cause; and,
g) Any other factors the Commission deems appropriate. [Amended effective 03/26/08]
SECTION 10. PROCEDURES
Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter XIII, all open space subdivision plans and applications, as well as conventional subdivision plans and applications submitted under Section 9 of this Chapter XIII, must meet the procedural and substantive requirements of these Regulations and the Zoning Regulations.

To protect and promote the public health, safety, welfare, convenience, and property values; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood, environmental damage, and other dangers; to provide adequate light, air, and water, to prevent overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate adequate provisions for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; to preserve and protect the unique character of the Town of Coventry; to protect sites and features of historic and archaeological significance; to conserve and protect existing and potential surface-water and groundwater drinking supplies, inland wetlands and watercourses, and other valuable natural resources; to prevent unnecessary soil erosion and sedimentation; and to provide adequate housing opportunities for all citizens of Coventry consistent with soil types, terrain, infrastructure capacity, and the rural character of the Town.
Section 1.02 Comprehensive Plan
The Zoning Regulations established hereunder, including the official Zoning Map, are in accordance with, and are hereby declared to embody, the comprehensive zoning plan of the Town of Coventry. In adopting these Regulations, the Commission has considered the Towns Plan of Conservation and Development prepared pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 8-23.

If a nonconforming lot meeting the requirements of subsection 4.02.01.a is not shown on an approved subdivision plan filed or recorded in the Coventry Land Records, the yard requirements for the lot shall be the lesser of (1) those required in the relevant zoning district, or (2) those required in accordance with the following tables:
1) Front and Rear Yards
If lot area is but equal to or Minimum front
less than greater than and rear yards are:
80,000 square feet 40,000 square feet 50 feet
40,000 square feet 30,000 square feet 25 feet
30,000 square feet 10,000 square feet 20 feet
16
10,000 square feet --- 15 feet
2) Side Yards
If lot width but equal to or Minimum side
is less than greater than yards are:
225 feet 200 feet 30 feet
200 feet 175 feet 25 feet
175 feet 150 feet 20 feet
150 feet 100 feet 15 feet
100 feet 75 feet 12 feet
75 feet --- 10 feet
d. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 4.02.01.a, the Commission may issue a special permit for a principal use, building, or structure on any lawfully established nonconforming lot that does not meet all of the criteria set forth in subsection 4.02.01.a. The minimum front and rear yards for such uses shall not be less than 20 feet and the minimum side yards shall not be less than 12.5 feet unless the Commission determines that a lesser setback is necessary to permit the reasonable use of the lot and that such reduced setback will not unreasonably affect the use or value of adjacent properties. Whenever any application for a special permit is made pursuant to this subsection d, the applicant shall, in addition to any other notices required by these Regulations, send written notice to the owners of each abutting lot of the filing of such application and the date and time at which the public hearing will be commenced on such application, Such notices shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the commencement of the public hearing, and proof of mailing shall be provided to the Commission before the conclusion of the public hearing.
Section 4.02.02 Prohibition of Creation of Nonconforming Lots or Parcels
Except as provided hereafter, the creation of any nonconforming lot or parcel by division of preexisting lots or parcels is prohibited. Nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to prohibit the adjustment of the boundary between two lots shown on an approved subdivision plan, so long as the adjustment does not (1) reduce the size of any lot below the minimum lot acreage that was required at the time of subdivision approval, or (2) create an additional, buildable lot. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of these Regulations, the Commission may grant a special permit to allow the division of any lot of record that was existing as of November 13, 2006, and that contained two separate single-family or two-family dwellings on that date, provided: (i) that each resulting lot would contain an area of at least 30,000 square feet and a lot width of at least 75 feet; (ii) that each resulting lot would contain no more than one single-family or two-family dwelling, and that all accessory structures would be on the same lot as the dwelling to which they are accessory; (iii) that each lot would have frontage on, or legal access to, a public highway; and (iv) that each lot would support both a suitable sewage-disposal facility and an adequate potable water supply, such facts to be demonstrated by written confirmation of the availability and adequacy of such facilities from the Director of Health or other qualified public official.
Section 4.02.03 Merger
Except as provided below, when any two or more contiguous lots or parcels are owned by the same person(s), and either lot or parcel does not meet current lot frontage or lot area requirements under these Regulations, the contiguous lots or parcels shall be deemed to have merged and shall be considered a single lot or parcel for purposes of these Regulations. The provisions of this section shall not apply to lots or parcels separated by a street, a public right-of-way, or a recorded private easement of travel or access existing as of the effective date of these Regulations, nor shall it apply to adjacent lots on each of
17
which a dwelling or other principal structure was erected before the lots became nonconforming. The provisions of this section shall also not apply to lots in subdivisions that have been approved by the Commission and recorded in the Coventry Land Records unless the subdivision approval has lapsed or otherwise become null and void. Where a series of contiguous lots owned by the same person or persons may be combined, in more than one manner, into two or more conforming lots without the alteration of lot lines or the creation of new lot lines, the owner(s) shall be permitted to specify the manner in which such combination shall occur by filing a deed, survey or other legal instrument in the office of the Town Clerk showing or describing such combination. The combination of nonconforming lots in the foregoing manner shall not be deemed to constitute a subdivision or resubdivision.
Section 4.03 Rear Lots
Section 4.03.01 New Rear Lot and Preexisting Rear Lot Defined
The terms new rear lot and preexisting rear lot shall have the respective meanings set forth in Section 2.02 of these Regulations.
Section 4.03.02 When Permitted
The Commission may approve the creation or use of new rear lots under two circumstances. When a new rear lot is created by the first division of a parcel of land subsequent to the date of adoption of subdivision regulations in the Town of Coventry, the Commission may approve the use of such lot by the issuance of a special permit. The Commission may also approve the creation and use of a new rear lot as part of a subdivision approval. In either instance, the Commission, in determining whether to grant approval for the creation or use of a new rear lot, shall apply the criteria for the issuance of a special permit, as well as the standards and criteria in Section 4.03.03 of these Regulations. The Commission may approve the creation or use of a new rear lot only if it finds that the lot would help provide a more appropriate development of the land (compared to a development without such lots) by better protecting or utilizing the natural resources of the site or of surrounding property; allowing better traffic sight lines at driveway entrances and exits; facilitating control of drainage, erosion, or sedimentation; or allowing visual buffering that better protects the character of or improves privacy in the neighborhood. In making this determination, the Commission may consider the topography of the land, natural resource conditions and characteristics, drainage and traffic impacts, the configuration of the lot and surrounding lots or parcels, driveway sightlines and utility service capabilities, and other factors that may potentially affect the public health, safety, welfare and property values.
Section 4.03.03 Rear Lot Standards and Criteria
Each new rear lot must have the following characteristics:
a. Public utilities must be installed underground within the lot unless the Commission determines that soil, bedrock, or groundwater conditions are such that installation would not be feasible or appropriate. Such utilities shall not be installed under a travelway unless necessary, and shall be installed after the travelway has been graded but before the base material or pavement is installed.
b. The accessway must be at least twenty-five (25) feet in width, and the applicant must demonstrate, to the Commissions satisfaction, that a driveway could be feasibly designed and constructed in the accessway. When the construction of such a driveway would require one or more activities regulated by the Coventry Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency, the applicant must demonstrate to the Commissions satisfaction that such a driveway could be feasibly designed and
18
constructed within the accessway. Any person wishing to reserve the right to subdivide or resubdivide a rear lot must provide an accessway at least fifty (50) feet in width in order to assure that sufficient land is available to create a highway right-of-way to provide access to the additional lots. Any applicant proposing to create or use a new rear lot having an accessway less than fifty (50) feet in width must submit a written waiver signed by both the applicant and the owner of the affected property containing the following language: (Revised -Effective 08/01/11)
The undersigned applicant acknowledges that a rear lot having an accessway less than fifty (50) feet wide may not be capable of further subdivision or resubdivision under the Coventry Zoning and Subdivision Regulations (the Regulations). The applicant further acknowledges that his/her/its [as appropriate] application to create such a rear lot is voluntary, and the applicant waives any right to demand to be allowed to divide the rear lot in the future unless such division can be made in conformance with the Regulations.
c. The accessway must be an integral part of the lot and may not be owned separately from the remainder of the lot, except as provided below. No accessway may be used for vehicular access to more than three lots.
d. Each driveway or other interior travelway must be laid out and designed to provide suitable access to emergency vehicles, including but not limited to fire trucks and ambulances (see driveway regulations in Section 4.14). The layout and design of the rear lots should occur in a manner to avoid excessive stacking of rear lot driveways, where numerous abutting rear lot driveways are created in succession. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating such suitability by sufficient evidence from appropriately trained persons, who may include, but are not limited to, the Coventry Fire Marshal. However, any applicant proposing a rear lot shall do so at his or her own risk and shall assume all responsibilities and liabilities for the design, construction, maintenance, and repair of such driveway or travelway. Neither the Town, the Commission, nor or any Town official or employee shall be responsible or liable in any manner for such driveway or travelway. (Revised  Effective 06/08/15)
e. The area of the accessway and of any other portion of the lot not meeting the minimum width requirements set forth in Table 4.04A shall not be counted as part of the required minimum lot area.
Section 4.03.04 Conditions of Approval
In addition to such other conditions as may be allowed under these Regulations, the Commission is authorized to condition the approval of a new rear lot on a fixed designation of the specific areas in which the house, septic system, and driveway or other interior travelway will be located and on the details of construction of such travelway.
Section 4.03.05 Preexisting Rear Lots
Rear lots that are not defined as new rear lots pursuant to Section 4.03.01 may be used in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 of these Regulations.
19
Section 4.04 Dimensional Standards
Section 4.04.01 General Requirements
Except as these Regulations may otherwise expressly provide, all uses and structures shall comply with the standards set forth in Table 4.04A.
Section 4.04.02 Lot Frontage and Width
Except as may otherwise be expressly provided in these Regulations, no building permit or zoning permit shall be issued for any building, structure, or use unless the lot for which the permit is sought has the required lot frontage and width. Lot frontage shall be measured on an existing street or a street under construction as shown on a properly approved and filed subdivision plan or other plan approved by the Commission. Corner lots shall be deemed to have two front yards, and lot frontage requirements must be met along or in the direction of all street lines. The minimum lot width shall be maintained from the building line to the rear setback line on lots other than corner lots. On corner lots, the minimum lot width shall be maintained from the building lines on each street to the side setback lines.
Section 4.04.03 Lot Area
a. Basic Requirements: The required minimum area of a lot as established by these Regulations must be in contiguous land and shall be measured exclusive of any accessway.
In addition, for the purpose of determining minimum lot area or parcel size and maximum lot coverage in all zones and districts, all of the following shall be excluded:
1. Areas that are submerged during the mean annual high water level of watercourses, as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 22a-38.
2. In zoning districts for which the minimum lot area requirement pursuant to Section 10 is 40,000 square feet or less, fifty percent (50%) of the areas defined as inland wetlands or watercourses by Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 22a-38.
3. In zoning districts for which the minimum lot area requirement pursuant to Section 10 is greater than 40,000 square feet, twenty-five percent (25%) of the areas defined as inland wetlands or watercourses by Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 22a-38.
b. Multiplication Factors for Property on Substandard Roads: The Commission finds that the maximum densities of development (i.e., minimum lot sizes) otherwise permitted under these Regulations are appropriate only for property abutting roads that meet current Town standards for width, pavement and drainage. Since those standards are intended to protect public health and safety, and since greater development densities both cause and allow greater traffic volumes, the Commission further finds that the maximum allowable densities should be reduced (i.e., that minimum lot sizes should be increased) along existing roads that do not meet the current Town standards. Therefore, the minimum lot areas shown in Table 4.04A must be multiplied by the following adjustment factors for each of the following circumstances:
20
Circumstances Adjustment Factor
Lots having frontage on unpaved streets 1.3
Lots having frontage on streets that do
not meet current Town standards for
drainage improvements 1.3
Lots having frontage on streets that do
not meet current Town standards for the
width of the travelway (the portion of
the street actually used for travel) 1.3
The foregoing adjustment factors shall be applied cumulatively. For example, a lot having frontage on an unpaved Town street that lacks proper drainage must have a minimum lot size that is (1.3 x 1.3 =) 1.69 times greater than the minimum lot size shown in Table 4.04A.
c. Applicants Option to Improve Road: An applicant for subdivision or development of property having frontage on a road that does not meet current Town standards for width, pavement, or drainage may, at his or her option, propose to improve that portion of the road abutting that property as a condition of subdivision or development approval. Any proposal to improve an existing road must be presented to the Public Works Director for review and possible approval prior to the filing of the subdivision or development application. Upon the approval of the Public Works Director of any such proposal for improvement to the portion of the road abutting the property to be subdivided or developed, the applicant shall be entitled to propose minimum lot sizes as though the road were already improved. To the extent permitted by the Connecticut General Statutes and the Town subdivision regulations, the Commission may require, as a condition of approval of any such subdivision or development, that a bond or other surety be provided to ensure that the road improvements are completed as proposed.
d. Increased Lot Size for Two-Family, Multi-Family and Farm Uses: Lots used for two-family or multi-family dwellings in the GR and VR zones must have 1.5 times the minimum lot area otherwise required by these Regulations. Lots used for two-family dwellings in other zones must have twice the minimum lot area otherwise required by these Regulations. Lots used for farms in the C/A Zone must have twice the minimum lot area otherwise required by these Regulations.
Section 4.04.04 Buildable Land Requirements
In order to facilitate lot development and lessen the risk of post-development problems, such as septic system failures, poor drainage, and erosion, each lot must contain a minimum amount of contiguous buildable land, as defined in Section 2.02 of these Regulations. The principal building shall be located on land that is either (1) buildable land or (2) land that fails to qualify as buildable land solely because bedrock is located with four feet of the surface. Any septic system to be used in connection with the principal building shall be located entirely within the minimum buildable land area. Any well serving such principal building need not be located within the minimum buildable land area. The required amount of buildable land for a lot in any zone shall be equivalent to 25,000 square feet.
Section 4.04.05 Height Limitations
The height limitations of these Regulations shall not apply to spires, belfries, or domes that are located on buildings used primarily for religious services; nor to cupolas, flagpoles, chimneys, silos, heating or cooling equipment, ventilating equipment, water tanks, skylights, antennas (excluding satellite dishes more than five (5) feet in diameter), and similar features that are accessory to a permitted building,
21
such as gable peaks, towers, parapets and cornices, except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Regulations. Such features shall serve only the primary structure, must occupy in the aggregate no more than ten percent (10%) of the building area, must not be used for human occupancy, and may be erected only to such heights as are reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purposes they are intended to serve.
Section 4.04.06 Lot Coverage
Maximum lot coverage shall be as shown in Table 4.04A. Lot coverage may be increased to fifteen percent (15 %) in the Lake Residential (LR) Zone if the applicant demonstrates that the surface runoff that would be generated by the area of impervious surface in excess of ten percent (10%) of the total lot area during the first one inch (1) of rainfall from any precipitation event will be collected and returned to the ground by an appropriate device or devices, such as, but not limited to, infiltration basins or trenches, rain gardens, or in-ground perforated chambers. The approval of any such increase in lot coverage shall be deemed to be conditioned on the maintenance of such structures. In the event that the applicant fails to maintain such structures after approval of any such increase in lot coverage, the Commission or Zoning Enforcement Officer, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, may issue an order to the landowner(s) requiring, without limitation, (1) that the structures be maintained, repaired or replaced; or (2) that the landowner(s) reduce lot coverage to no more than 10%.
As an example of the implementation of the foregoing provisions, and for purposes of additional clarity only, the following scenario is given:
- Lot Area: 40,000 square feet
- 10% maximum lot coverage allowed as of right under Table 4.04A: 4,000 square feet
- 15% maximum lot coverage allowed under this Section 4.04.06: 6,000 square feet
- Area of impervious surface in excess of 10%: 2,000 square feet
- Volume of surface runoff expected to be generated by first inch of rainfall on 2,000 square feet of impervious surface: 166.6 cubic feet (1,240 gallons)
In order to increase lot coverage to 15%, applicant must demonstrate that the lot has been equipped with devices sufficient to return at least 1,240 gallons of water to the ground during any one precipitation event.
The foregoing determination may be made by either the Commission or the Zoning Enforcement Officer upon advice of the Town Engineer.
In the event the Commission or Zoning Enforcement Officer issues any permit or approval allowing lot coverage to be greater than 10% in the Lake Residential (LR) Zone, such permit or approval shall not become effective until a notice of such approval or permit is filed in the Coventry Land Records in the following form:
NOTICE
Location of Property: _________________________ Owners Name(s): _________________________
A zoning permit was issued on [specify the date of issuance] to allow the lot coverage on the property referenced above to exceed 10% (ten percent). The permit is conditioned upon the landowners continued compliance with Section 4.04.06 of the Coventry Zoning Regulations, which requires the landowner to maintain certain drainage/infiltration structures on the property. The failure to maintain such structures may result in the issuance of zoning enforcement orders and/or other zoning enforcement proceedings, including an action for civil penalties and/or injunctive relief in the Superior Court.

Notes:
1 Minimum lot areas shown in this table must be increased in accordance with Section 4.04.03 for lots that do not have frontage on a road meeting current Town standards. In addition, lots used for two-family or multi-family dwellings in the GR and VR zones must have 1.5 times the minimum lot area shown above, and lots used for two-family dwellings in other zones must have twice the minimum lot area shown above. Lots used for farms in the C/A Zone must have twice the minimum lot area shown above.
2. Minimum lot area and frontage for lots abutting Connecticut Route 44 (Boston Turnpike) shall be 200,000 of commercial square feet and 500 feet, respectively, except as provided in Sections 4.04.02 and 4.04.03. Minimum lot area and frontage for all other lots shall be 40,000 square feet and 150 feet, respectively.
3. May be increased to 15% in accordance with Section 4.04.06.
* May be further reduced to the average applicable yard or setback of adjoining lots with existing structures.
23
Section 4.05 Limitations on Number of Principal Uses, Buildings and Structures
Except as hereinafter provided, or as specifically provided elsewhere in these Regulations, no more than one (1) principal use and one (1) principal building or structure shall be permitted on a lot in the GR-40, GR-80, LR, and R/A zones. The main dairy, livestock, poultry, or other barn on a farm shall be allowed as and deemed to be a second principal building. The Commission may grant a special permit to allow more than one (1) use or principal building or structure on a lot in the VR, G, VC, C/A, C, NC, RD, and PO zones if the buildings or structures and land otherwise comply with all other requirements of the zone in which they are located.
Section 4.06 Accessory Uses, Buildings, and Structures
Section 4.06.01 Buildings and Structures Generally
a. Accessory structures customarily incidental to any use permitted herein are allowed, provided that such accessory structures shall not include any signs except as allowed under Section 5.01. Unless otherwise provided in these Regulations, a special permit shall be required for any accessory use, building, or structure on any lot or parcel on which the principal use is a specially permitted use.
b. An accessory building shall not be used as a dwelling unit unless specifically allowed elsewhere in these Regulations.
c. A barn or stable may be erected to a greater height than the principal residential structure on a lot, provided the height restrictions of Section 4.04.05 are met.
d. Accessory buildings on a residential lot may include private garages in which not more than three (3) spaces may be occupied by a commercial vehicle. Private garages may not be used for the conduct of any commercial occupation or business, other than home occupations to the extent permitted by these Regulations.
e. Accessory buildings, other than residential motor vehicle garages, shall not occupy, in the aggregate, more than three percent (3%) of the area of the lot on which they are located. Residential motor vehicle garages may occupy no more than 3,000 square feet on the lot on which they are located; provided, however, that residential motor vehicle garages may occupy more than 3,000 square feet but not more than 5,000 square feet of the area of the lot on which they are located upon the issuance of a special permit. The granting of such a special permit shall require that the proposed motor vehicle garage:
1. Be located on a lot of at least five (5) acres.
2. Have a footprint no greater than three (3) times the size of the residential primary structure of the lot.
3. If determined reasonable and necessary by the Commission, have such vegetative or other types of screening as necessary to provide a visual barrier to off-site residences.
24
f. Accessory structures shall observe the same yard requirements as principal structures, except as otherwise provided in subsection g, below, Section 4.11.d, or other applicable provisions of these Regulations.
g. Notwithstanding the yard requirements set forth elsewhere in these Regulations, detached accessory buildings that are not more than thirteen feet (13) in height may be located:
1. In the rear half of any lot, but not nearer than 75 feet to any street (except for roadside shelters).
2. Up to, but not nearer than, five feet (5) from any side or rear lot line, except that any building used to keep poultry, horses or livestock shall not be located closer than fifty (50) feet from any street or lot line.
3. Roadside shelters for the use of school children may be permitted as accessory uses in any zone. Such shelters may not be more than fifty (50) square feet in area nor ten feet (10) in height, and may be located up to, but not closer than, one foot (1) from any front or side lot line, unless the governmental authority responsible for the adjacent street allows the use of the right-of-way in writing. In no case shall the shelter be nearer than ten feet (10) from the pavement or other portion of the street used by motor vehicles. The shelter must be removed if not used for a consecutive period of twelve months.
4. Notwithstanding anything in these Regulations to the contrary, one detached accessory building that is not more than thirteen feet (13) in height may be located on any non-conforming lot, provided that the following conditions are satisfied; (Revised  Effective 06/08/15)
i) the structure is located not less than five feet (5) from any property line;
ii) the structure is used only for the storage of personal property and not, for example, for the keeping of livestock or pets;
iii) no more than one such structure may be located on any lot, provided that such lot may have a garage if such garage is either non-conforming or otherwise permitted under these Regulations;
iv) the structure is no more than 100 hundred (100) square feet in size;
v) the structure does not violate the lot coverage provisions set forth in Section 4.06.01.e (Revised Effective 06/15/12)
5. On nonconforming corner lots, not closer to either of the streets than the front of the principal building. (Revised Effective 06/15/12)
h. Structures providing swimming, boating, or other forms of riparian access to a river or lake, such as piers, docks, and moorings, shall be deemed to be accessory to all uses of property abutting a river or lake and shall be permitted as of right, provided that nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to convey any such riparian rights.
25
Section 4.06.02 Swimming Pools
Swimming pools shall meet the front and side yard requirements of the applicable zone. The rear yard requirements of Table 4.04A shall not apply to swimming pools except in those zones in which the required rear yard is 20 feet or less. In all other zones, the rear yard requirement for swimming pools shall be deemed to be 20 feet. The required yards (setbacks) for swimming pools shall be measured from the water-retaining wall in the case of an in-ground pool, and from the outer edge and any above-ground deck of an above-ground pool.
Section 4.06.03 Attached Accessory Buildings
If any accessory building is attached to a main building, including attachment by means of a breezeway or a roofed passageway with open or latticed sides, it shall comply in all respects to the requirements of these Regulations applicable to the main building.
Section 4.06.04 Home Occupations as Accessory Uses
Home occupations shall be permitted as an accessory use to any single-family or two-family dwelling, subject to the standards and conditions set forth in Section 5.05 of these Regulations.
Section 4.06.05 Agricultural Accessory Uses
Agricultural activities are permitted on property on which one or more dwellings are located provided such activities are clearly accessory in nature to the residential use; i.e., the activities must be subordinate or incidental to the residential use. In no event shall the conduct of agricultural activities on a contiguous land area of 80,000 square feet or more be deemed to be a residential accessory use unless the Commission, upon application, expressly finds that such activities are accessory in nature. The foregoing reference to a contiguous land area of 80,000 square feet or more means the area being actively used for agriculture and not the size of the lot; for example, agricultural activities that occur on only one acre of a five-acre residential lot may be deemed to be accessory without an express finding by the Commission. However, nothing in this Section 4.06.05 shall be deemed to prohibit the Zoning Agent or the Commission from finding, in appropriate circumstances, that agricultural activities occurring on areas smaller than 80,000 square feet are principal, rather than accessory, uses. The Commission may grant a special permit for the raising or sheltering of livestock on lots that are less than 80,000 square feet, but no less than 40,000 square feet, in size. The raising or sheltering of livestock on lots that are less than 40,000 square feet in size shall not be permitted as an accessory use. (Revised - Effective 08/01/11)
Section 4.06.06 In-Law Apartments
The Commission recognizes that many families need, on a temporary basis, to provide housing for members of their extended families. In-law apartments, as defined in section 2.02, may therefore be permitted as accessory uses to single-family dwellings and allowed by zoning permit, but only under the following conditions:
a. The space devoted to the in-law apartment within a single-family dwelling must be interconnected by at least one (1) interior doorway to the remainder of the dwelling, so that a person could gain access to the in-law apartment from an exterior doorway serving the remainder of the house, and vice versa.
26
b. The in-law apartment may only be occupied by parents, siblings, grandparents, great grandparents, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, or first cousins of one or more persons who occupy the remainder of the dwelling.
c. The Director of Health or his or her designee must issue a written determination that the in-law apartment does or would not violate any applicable provisions of the Public Health Code.
d. A standard notice, approved by the Town Attorney, shall be filed on the land records of the Town stating that the property contains an in-law apartment and that it is not approved for use as a two-family dwelling.
Section 4.06.07 Musical Entertainment
Musical entertainment shall be allowed as an accessory use to a restaurant, café, or other commercial establishment that serves food or beverages, but only upon the issuance of a special permit. In addition to the special permit criteria in Section 7.03 of these regulations, any such musical entertainment must meet the following criteria:
a. Musical entertainment shall not be permitted between the hours of 1:00 a.m. through 9:00 a.m. on any Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday; nor shall it be permitted between the hours of 2:00 a.m. through 9:00 a.m. on any Friday or Saturday. The Commission may further restrict such hours as a condition of any special permit if the Commission finds that such restrictions are reasonably necessary to minimize harm or nuisance to surrounding properties.
b. Musical entertainment shall be allowed only inside the principal building unless the special permit expressly provides otherwise.
c. The musical entertainment shall not be unreasonably loud at the property line. The Commission may require the installation of physical sound buffers or barriers or other methods to reduce sound volume or vibration if the sound levels or vibration would cause a nuisance or otherwise interfere with the reasonable use of nearby property.
d. All special permits issued under this Section 4.06.07 shall be limited to a period of three years and shall be conditioned upon continuous satisfaction of the foregoing criteria and standards. The Commission may revoke, refuse to renew, or place additional conditions on renewal of the special permit if it finds that the applicant has failed to comply with the terms and provisions of the permit or that circumstances in the neighborhood have changed, requiring additional protection of nearby uses.
Section 4.06.08 Farm Labor Living Quarters (Added  Effective 05/11/09)
A zoning permit or site plan approval may be issued for one or more dwellings serving as accessory uses to a principal agricultural use on a lot, but only under the following conditions:
a. The dwelling(s) shall be used solely to house persons, and the immediate families of persons, whose principal labor during the time of such occupation involves the planting, tending, or harvesting of crops on, or the care of farm animals housed on, the premises on which the dwelling(s)
27
would be established. For the purposes of this regulation, immediate families includes only children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews.
b. In the event that the applicant proposes to create one or more new dwellings (i.e., independent buildings to be used solely for dwelling purposes), site plan approval by the Commission shall be required. In addition, the applicant must submit, and the Commission must approve, a feasibility plan containing sufficient information for the Commission to find that, if the principal agricultural activities were to cease, the property could be subdivided or otherwise configured in such a manner that each single-family dwelling would be on a separate, conforming lot, and each multi-family dwelling would become a conforming principal use. Such information must include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, proof that an adequate water supply and sewage disposal facilities would be available to each potential lot and that an adequate amount of open space or recreational land could be set aside to meet the requirements of the Subdivision Regulations. In order to help ensure adequacy of lot area, the feasibility plan must demonstrate that the lots are equal to at least 1.5 times the minimum lot size required in the zone where the property is located. The purpose of this condition is to avoid the necessity, and potential financial hardship, of requiring that any dwellings be removed in the event the principal agricultural activities were to cease.
c. A zoning permit may be issued for accessory farm labor living quarters when the proposed new dwelling unit(s) would be created either (i) within an existing principal or accessory building, either by changing the existing use or by increasing the size of such building, or (ii) in a proposed new building (such as, but not limited to, a barn or storage building) that would be used for agricultural accessory purposes other than, and in addition to, the dwelling unit(s). The applicant must provide sufficient information for the Zoning Agent to find that, if the principal agricultural activities were to cease, the property could still be used in full conformance with the Zoning Regulations. In lieu of such proof, the applicant may provide an affidavit, in a form to be provided by the Coventry Land Use Office, acknowledging that, in the event the property is no longer used for agricultural purposes, the dwelling units will have to be removed, and that the Commission or its authorized agent may order such removal, if the dwelling units no longer comply with the Zoning Regulations. The removal of a dwelling unit in a building that is also used for other purposes may be accomplished by the removal of the separate kitchen facilities for such dwelling unit. The affidavit shall be filed in the Coventry Land Records. The applicant must also provide proof that an adequate water supply and sewage disposal facilities would be available to each proposed dwelling unit.
d. If the property ceases to be used for agricultural purposes, the landowner must, by January 1 of the calendar year following such cessation, file all such applications as may be required to subdivide or otherwise reconfigure the property in accordance with the terms of subparagraph 2, above, or to bring the property, in some other manner, into full compliance with the Zoning Regulations as they may then have been revised. The landowner must submit an affidavit, acknowledging that, in the event the property is no longer used for agricultural purposes, the dwellings will have to be removed, and that the Commission or its authorized agent may order such removal, if the dwellings no longer comply with the Zoning Regulations. The affidavit shall be filed in the Coventry Land Records. This paragraph shall not be deemed to apply to dwelling units permitted pursuant to subparagraph 3.
e. The principal agricultural activities shall be deemed not to have ceased if conducted for a continuous period of at least 60 days during the course of any calendar year.
f. All applicable provisions of the Public Health Code and Building Code must be satisfied. Proof of satisfaction of these provisions must be provided by the Towns Health Official and Building Official or their respective designees before any certificate of occupancy will be issued.
28
Section 4.07 Building Drainage
Whenever a new building, or a lateral addition to an existing building, is to be constructed, adequate grades should be maintained around the building, or sufficient subsurface drainage should be provided, in such a manner as to prevent surface water from flowing against the walls of the building.
Section 4.08 Building Restoration
Nothing in these Regulations shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of a building or structure declared unsafe by the Building Official or where required by any lawful order.
Section 4.09 Building Lines
No structure shall be erected between the building line and the street line, except (i) an open agricultural fence; (ii) any other wall or fence not over four (4) feet in height; (iii) signs as permitted under these Regulations; (iv) an appropriate driveway. See Section 7.08 of these Regulations as to when a permit is required for erection of a wall or fence.
Section 4.10 Traffic Sightlines
No obstruction, such as vehicles, machinery, materials, signs, hedges, trees, shrubs, or other growth, shall be created, placed, established, or erected in such a way that it interferes with a clear view of drivers of vehicles on a curve or at any street intersection and endangers the safety of those traveling upon any street. The Commission or its authorized agent may order the removal of any object that unreasonably obstructs the clear view of drivers or otherwise endangers the safety of those traveling on a street. For minimum vision clearance, no structure or other object shall be created, established, or erected to a height exceeding three (3) feet above the street grade within a radius of fifty (50) feet from the point of intersection of any two street lines. A greater distance may be required upon higher volume roads.
Section 4.11 Projections and Accessory Structures in Required Yards
No structures or projections from structures shall be permitted in any required yard except as follows:
a. Minor projections of structures, such as window or door frames and sills, cornices, or other architectural features may project not more than three (3) feet into any required yard.
b. In residential zones, major projections of structures such as chimneys, bay windows, eaves, roofs over doorways, hatchways, steps, and fire escapes may project not more than five (5) feet into any required yard.
c. The yard requirements of these Regulations shall not apply to driveways, walls or fences, generators, utility transformers, propane tanks, playscapes and dog houses. However, in any residential zone, no wall or fence shall exceed eight (8) feet in height, measured above the natural grade. See Section 7.08 of these Regulations as to when a permit is required for erection of a wall or fence. (Revised - Effective 08/11/11)
29
d. The Commission may, by special permit, reduce the yard requirements for any accessory structure other than a garage, barn, or other structure intended for human occupancy or the enclosure of animals or motor vehicles, provided (i) that adequate screening and/or other buffering is provided to minimize any potential adverse impacts on abutting properties; (ii) that the structure would not unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of any existing uses on any adjacent lot or parcel ; (iii) that the Commission finds the reduction to be necessary or appropriate to allow the most reasonable use of the parcel, taking into consideration such factors as the geometry of the parcel, the visibility of the proposed structure from adjoining streets or from existing uses on adjacent properties, the location of other structures, and the location of significant natural or historical resources, such as monuments, burial grounds, mature trees, stone walls and stone fences, wetlands, watercourses, prominent rock outcrops and large boulders; and (iv) that no yard requirement may be reduced to less than five (5) feet. The Commission may condition any Special Permit for the reduction of required yards under this section on the installation and/or maintenance of appropriate screening.
e. Ramps for handicapped access may be constructed within required yard areas, provided the Zoning Agent determines that (i) the ramp may not reasonably be located in any area that is not within the required yard; and (ii) the proposed intrusion into the required yard is the minimum reasonably necessary to accomplish the desired access objectives.
Section 4.12 Open Space Subdivisions
Section 4.12.01 Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this Section 4.12 is to (1) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural or scenic resources, (2) protect natural streams and water supplies, (3) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, and other significant natural features and landmarks, (4) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces, (5) enhance public recreation opportunities, (6) preserve historic sites, and (7) promote orderly urban or suburban development. These regulations are intended to provide for increased flexibility, balanced by increased control, in the development of land so as to facilitate the preservation of open space, natural resources, recreational uses, and community character.
Section 4.12.02 General Density Limitations
Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations, the maximum number of units for an open space subdivision shall be determined, at the applicants option, by either the Formula Method or the Yield Plan Method.
a. Formula Method: If the applicant chooses the Formula Method, the maximum number of lots shall not exceed the number resulting from dividing the total area of the parcel, subject to the exclusions stated hereafter, by the minimum lot size that would be permitted for a conventional subdivision in the applicable zoning district. The total area of the parcel, as measured for purposes of this section, shall exclude the following: (i) land that is not "buildable land," as defined in Section 2.02 of the Zoning Regulations, and (ii) existing and proposed streets and highways, easements and rights-of-way for vehicular access and utilities.
30
b. Yield Plan Method: If the applicant chooses the Yield Plan Method, the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations governing conventional subdivision lots. Although such yield plans shall be conceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs, they must be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout. Consequently, yield plans must identify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development, including, but not limited to, topographic contours, at a contour interval of no more than ten (10) feet; wetlands and watercourses; 100-year floodplains (Flood Zones A, as shown on FEMA maps); slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%); rock outcrops; and easements and rights-of-way affecting the parcel.
On lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility, soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated. The Commission may select a small percentage of lots (10 to 15%) to be tested, in areas considered to be marginal. If all tests on the sample lots meet applicable Public Health Code requirements, the applicant's other lots shall also be deemed suitable for septic systems, for the purpose of calculating total lot yield. However, if any of the sample lots fail, several others (of the Commissions choosing) shall be tested, until all the lots in a given sample pass.
Section 4.12.03 Density Bonuses
The maximum number of lots allowed under Section 4.12 may be increased in one of the following ways:
a. Open Space Maintenance Fund: The Commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. The density bonus granted under this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4.12.02. Any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcel to be subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either (i) the Town of Coventry or (ii) the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan. The amount of the fee shall be set by the following formula: [(CFMV/N) x (0.5 XL)], where CFMV is the cumulative fair market value of all of the buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, N is the total number of buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, and XL is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus. The value of CFMV shall, at the option of the applicant, be (i) the 100% value of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the Town Assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision approval, or (ii) determined by a licensed Connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the Commission, in which case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees.
b. Other Open Space Dedications: A density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space, meaning the amount of any open space acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this Section 4.12.02. The additional open space may be within the parcel to be subdivided or elsewhere within the Town of Coventry. For each five acres of excess open space accepted by the Commission, one additional building lot shall be allowed, up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4.12.02. The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate excess open space shall be at the discretion of the Commission, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the Town's Plan of Conservation and Development and its determination as to the value of the excess land for any of the purposes described in Section 4.12.01.
31
c. Encouraging Affordable Housing: A density bonus shall be allowed for open space subdivisions that provide affordable housing, as defined in Section 8-30g of the Connecticut General Statutes. For each affordable housing unit provided under this section, one additional lot shall be permitted, up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under Section 4.12.02. Affordable housing is herein defined as units to be sold or rented to families earning 70-120 percent of the county median income, adjusted for family size, as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Section 4.12.04 Open Space Percentage and Use Limitations
a. Minimum Percentage of Open Space: The minimum area of open space to be dedicated within an open space subdivision shall be forty percent (40%) of the total area of the parcel being subdivided. In addition, the area of open space to be dedicated must contain at least forty percent (40%) of the total area of the parcel that does not comprise wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. As an example, if a parcel containing 100 acres is subdivided, and 30 acres of the parcel consists of wetlands, watercourses, or flood plain areas, the minimum open-space dedication will be 40 acres (100 acres x .40), and at least 28 acres (70 acres x .40) of the dedicated area must not be wetlands, watercourses or flood plain areas. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a subdivider from dedicating additional land consisting of wetlands, watercourses or flood plain areas, so long as the minimum amount of other types of land is also provided. For instance, in the example given above, the subdivider could dedicate 20 acres (not just 12 acres) of wetlands, so long as the dedication also included the minimum 28 acres of land that did not consist of wetlands, watercourses or floodplain areas. The Commission encourages subdividers to dedicate or otherwise preserve as much of the wetlands, watercourses and floodplain areas as possible.
b. Use of Open Space Areas: The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant. The required open space may be used, without restriction, for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems, provided that no portion of such systems protrudes above grade. Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space, as may land within the rights-of-way for underground utility lines. However, land within the rights-of way of overhead power lines or other surface utility lines shall not be included in the minimum required open space.
Section 4.12.05 Design Standards
a. Dimensional Requirements: The dimensional requirements for lots in an open space subdivision shall be as follows:
Minimum Lot Area 25,000 square feet
Minimum Lot Frontage 100 feet (25 feet for rear lots)
Minimum Front Yard 50 feet
Minimum Side Yard 20 feet
Minimum Rear Yard 50 feet
Maximum Lot Coverage 15%
Rear lots shall contain no less than 35,000 square feet, excluding the area of the accessway, and shall have a minimum driveway access width of twenty-five (25') feet. All lots in an open space subdivision shall comply with the minimum buildable area requirements set forth in Section 4.04.04
32
except where the lot(s) is/are to be served by a community septic system in conformance with all Department of Environmental Protection and State Public Health Code regulations and requirements.
b. Other Design Standards: In designing an open space subdivision, the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in Section 4.12.01 and the following factors:
1. Dwelling units shall be grouped allowing a portion of the parcel to remain open.
2. The open space in any open space subdivision shall be located entirely within the subdivision and shall be in one contiguous piece, unless the Commission finds that the purposes of Section 4.12.01 would be more effectively served by separated parcels. The open space shall have suitable shape, dimension, character and location to promote the purposes specified in Section 4.12.01.
3. When designing an open space subdivision the applicant must refer to the Town's Open Space Plan and plan the development in relation to the open space by first (1) locating the proposed open space; second, locating houses; third, locating roads; and, fourth, laying out lot configurations.
4. Lots shall be laid out to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives (listed below in order of priority, as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site):
a. to place septic systems on the most suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal (in unsewered areas only);
b. within any woodland contained in the parcel, or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland (to reduce impact upon agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind, and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features);
c. in locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadway(s);
d. on the least fertile soils for agricultural uses, and in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use;
e. in locations where the greatest number of units could be designed to take maximum advantage of solar heating opportunities.
5. Wherever possible, wetlands should be adjacent, contiguous or included in the Open Space.
6. Along any part of the parcel perimeter where down-sized lots abut normal-sized lots a fifty-foot buffer zone, thickly planted with fast-growing native shrubs and trees may all be required, or an already forested strip or natural vegetation may be accepted at the discretion of the Commission. (Revised - Effective 08/01/11)
7. Unless prevented by ledge or other natural restraints, underground utilities shall be required in open space subdivisions.
33
8. Proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved.
9. Proposed open space areas should include irreplaceable natural features located in the tract (such as, but not limited to stream beds, significant stands of trees, individual trees of significant size, and rock outcroppings).
10. Open space intended for recreation or other active public use should be easily accessible to pedestrians, including, to the extent feasible, the handicapped and elderly.
11. Individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites, and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel.
The Commission may require the subdivider to refer any proposed open space subdivision to a professional landscape architect for review, comment and modification. The Commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed, if it determines that such modified location(s) will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these Regulations and the Subdivision Regulations. In making such determination, the Commission may also consider: (i) the ownership of any existing open space on adjacent properties, or the proximity to non-adjacent open space which might reasonably interconnect with the proposed open space in the future; (ii) the proposed use of the open space for active or passive uses, and the extent of maintenance, supervision, or management required; (iii) the potential benefits which the open space might provide to residents of the Town or the State, if it were accessible to them; (iv) the size shape, topography, and character of the open space; (v) the recommendations of the Coventry Plan of Development and the Coventry Open Space Plan; and (vi) the reports or recommendations of any State, regional or Town agencies and officials.
Section 4.12.06 Dedication of Open Space
a. Method of Dedication: The Commission shall determine the most appropriate method of disposition after considering, among other things, the relationship of the subject area(s) and its specific characteristics to the Plan of Conservation and Development and the objectives cited in Chapter VIII, Section 1; the desirability and suitability of public access and use and the scope of the subdivision proposal. The following disposition options may, be utilized by the Commission:
1. Perpetual dedication to the Town.
2. Perpetual dedication to the State of Connecticut for open space or recreational purposes.
3. Perpetual dedication to a land trust (at the option of the subdivider), as long as the land trust has agreed to accept the dedication.
4. Dedication to a homeowners' association for open space or recreational purposes.
5. Utilization of conservation easement(s), with or without public access.
6. Utilization of a recreation easement, to the Town, State, or a private non-profit entity.
34
7. Utilization of an agricultural use restriction easement, to the Town, State, or a private, non-profit entity.
8. Private ownership for open space purposes with the appropriate taking of development rights.
9. Any combination of the above or any suitable alternative approved by the Commission.
Any conservation easements or other open space covenants or restrictions shall be subject to the approval of the Commission in form and content.
b. Agreement to Accept Ownership and Responsibility: If open space is to be owned by a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation, the State of Connecticut, the Town of Coventry, or another entity, the application shall contain written evidence from the proposed entity satisfactory to the Commission, stating that it is willing to accept ownership of and responsibility for the preservation and maintenance of the open space. Regardless of the manner of ownership of the open space, the instrument of conveyance must include provisions satisfactory in form and substance to the Commission to ensure:
1. The continued use of such land for the intended purposes;
2. The continuity of proper maintenance for those portions of the open space requiring maintenance;
3. When appropriate, the availability of funds required for such maintenance;
4. Adequate insurance protection; and
5. Recovery for loss sustained by casualty, condemnation or otherwise.
c. Boundary Markings: The boundary lines of all open space shall be set in the field and marked by permanent, readily-visible markers where such lines intersect any lot line, road or perimeter line within the proposed open space subdivision and at such other points as may be required by the Commission to insure identification in the field.
d. Recording of Documents: At the time the approved open space subdivision plan is filed, the applicant shall record on the Coventry Land Records all legal documents required to ensure the aforesaid guarantees.
e. Right to Enforce: A right to enforce the Development Restriction shall be conveyed to:
1. The Town of Coventry, the State of Connecticut, or a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation dedicated to conservation or preservation purposes in cases where the open space is dedicated to an association or corporation of lot owners, or a private or governmental entity; or
2. To the association or corporation of lot owners in cases where open space is dedicated to the Town of Coventry, the State of Connecticut, or a private, not-for-profit conservation trust or corporation.
35
Any deed of conveyance shall contain language providing the holder of the Development Restriction with the right to obtain reimbursement for all costs it reasonably incurs, including attorney's fees, in any action to enforce the Development Restriction, in which it is the prevailing party.
f. Association Requirements: If the open space is to be dedicated to an association or corporation of lot owners, then the Commission shall consider the following additional issues in determining whether to approve such proposal: (Revised - Effective 08/01/11)
1. The increase in the burden imposed by the proposed open space subdivision on existing and proposed areas of open space.
2. Any relevant recommendations of the Town Council, the Inland Wetlands Agency, the Parks and Recreation Commission, the Board of Finance, the Conservation Commission, or any other public or private agencies or authorities regarding the most appropriate disposition and management of the open space.
3. The level of access to the areas of open space proposed to be afforded to members of the general public.
4. The manner in which the association would manage the open space, and the extent to which proper management would be assured.
In approving any proposed dedication of open space to an association or corporation, the Commission, may set additional requirements to assure the proper and continuing management and oversight of the open space, including, but not limited to, the following,
5. Creation of the association or corporation prior to the sale of any lot;
6. Mandatory membership in the association or corporation by all original lot owners and any subsequent owner; and
7. Requiring the association or corporation to have the power to assess and collect from each lot owner a specified share of, and, where necessary, provide reserves for the costs associated with maintenance, repair, upkeep, and insurance of the open space.
Section 4.12.07 Procedures for Approval
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.12, all open space subdivision plans and applications must meet the procedural and substantive requirements of the Subdivision Regulations and these Zoning Regulations.
Section 4.12.08 Lots Deemed to Be Conforming
Any lot with reduced area approved under the provisions of this Section 4.12 shall be deemed to be a conforming lot notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.04; provided, however, that such lot meets the requirements of the other applicable sections of these Regulations.
36
Section 4.13 Health and Environmental Standards
Section 4.13.01 Statement of Purpose
In accordance with the purposes described in Section 1.01 of these Regulations, and more specifically to promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by minimizing noise, glare, odors, heat, and vibrations, and by minimizing the discharge of toxic substances and other pollutants into the air, surface water, soil, and groundwater, the following Performance and Environmental Standards are hereby established to apply to all buildings, structures, and uses in all zones within the Town of Coventry. No permit shall be issued for a building, structure, or use under these Regulations if the Commission determines that such building, structure, or use would not comply with these standards. If the Commission determines that any building, structure, or use established after the effective date of these Regulations is or has been in violation of these standards, the Commission may issue any order or seek any remedy or penalty provided by state or municipal law for the violation of zoning regulations.
Section 4.13.02 Sewage and Other Waste Disposal
All methods of sewage and waste treatment and disposal shall comply with regulations of the State of Connecticut for maximum protection of groundwater.
Section 4.13.03 Wells
All wells shall comply with regulations of the State of Connecticut.
Section 4.13.04 Nuisances; Unreasonable Physical Impacts on Nearby Property
No use of any lot or parcel shall be conducted in such a way as to create a nuisance to adjacent or nearby property as a result of unreasonable or excessive noise, glare, heat, smoke, fumes, vibrations, drainage, radiation, electromagnetic emissions, attraction of vermin, or other physical impacts. In general, heat, smoke, fumes, and offensive odors (other than odors associated with customary farming and agricultural uses) should not be perceptible beyond the property line of the lot on which the use is located unless the person(s) conducting such use demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Commission, that such impacts are reasonable under all of the attendant circumstances, including the nature of nearby uses and the time and duration of the impacts. All uses shall comply with the terms of all applicable federal, state, and Town statutes, regulations, and ordinances regarding noise, odor, and other environmental and health concerns. Any outdoor lighting for illumination of signs, spotlighting, or floodlighting shall be so shielded that the light source cannot be seen beyond the property line of the lot or parcel on which it is located. Light shall be directed downward, when reasonably possible, in such a manner as to minimize the scatter of light onto adjacent or nearby properties or into the night sky.
Section 4.13.05 Fire or Other Emergency
All uses shall provide for adequate access and movement of firefighting and other emergency vehicles, equipment, and personnel. In addition, proper safeguards must be employed to minimize any risk of fire, explosion, flooding, discharge of hazardous materials, and other threats to public safety. The
37
Commission may delegate to the Coventry Fire Marshal the power to review and decide upon the adequacy of all such emergency provisions.
Section 4.14 Driveways
Section 4.14.01 Permit Requirements
a. General: A driveway or access road serving private property and intersecting with a Town or State road shall be constructed in such a manner that it does not interfere with the existing drainage, movement of traffic, or removal of snow from the Town or State road. No person, firm or corporation shall conduct work or make improvements of any kind within a Town road or associated right-of-way, including but not limited to clearing, excavating or grading, until a permit has been obtained from the Director of Public Works or his authorized agent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement of any work. A driveway or access road serving private property and intersecting with a State road or a road within an adjacent town shall meet the standards of the applicable governing authority. Driveways serving more than one lot shall conform to the standards established in this section, except as may otherwise be required by the Coventry Subdivision Regulations. Common driveways shall not be permitted to serve more than three (3) dwelling units.
b. Application: Application for a permit shall be made on forms provided by the Director of Public Works and shall be accompanied by a sketch or drawing showing the proposed work to be done. The sketch or drawing shall be in sufficient detail to facilitate an inspection of the work by Town personnel. The Director of Public Works may require the submission of detailed plans, specifications, and other engineering data with the application when he shall deem it to be necessary. No permits shall be issued unless all proposed work conforms to the requirements outlined in this section and the attached Driveway Detail Drawings.
c. Application Fees; Certificate of Insurance and Performance Bond: Required application fees shall be submitted with all applications. In addition, a Certificate of Insurance conforming to current town requirements with respect to the types of coverage and limits of liability, and a Performance Bond in the amount determined by the Director of Public Works, shall also be submitted. No permits shall be issued until the application fee has been paid, and the Certificate of Insurance and Performance Bond received.
d. Inspection: All construction work covered by a Driveway Permit shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the Director of Public Works or his authorized representative. It is the responsibility of the owner to notify the Director of Public Works at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to any paving of a driveway or driveway apron so that an inspection can be made of the gravel base and driveway or driveway apron grade. If, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works or his or her authorized representative, there is some question if the driveway or driveway apron exceeds the maximum grades permitted in this section, then it is the responsibility of the owner to retain the services of a licensed land surveyor to prepare a profile based on actual field survey. Any driveway or driveway apron that is not found to be in conformance with the requirements in this section shall be reconstructed as required to conform.
38
e. Completion Time: All proposed construction work shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after issuance of the Driveway Permit unless a one hundred eighty (180) calendar day extension of time is granted by the Director of Public Works upon written request by the owner for such extension and for good cause shown. If a proposed driveway is not constructed within three hundred sixty (360) calendar days from the date of issuance of a permit from the Director of Public Works, the permit shall be null and void.
f. Final Approval: No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the Director of Public Works or his or her authorized representative approves the driveway or, if due to the time of year the bituminous concrete mix plants are closed, a Driveway Completion Bond is provided to the Town of Coventry to ensure that all work is completed within a six (6) month period. Driveway Completion Bonds shall be in the form of a certified check in an amount determined as follows:
Driveway Aprons: $700.00
Additional Required Driveway Length to High Point: $10.00 per lineal foot
Driveway Repairs: No bond required
Should the owner fail to complete the driveway improvements within the six (6) month time period beginning on the date the bond was provided to the Town of Coventry, the bond shall be forfeited, and the Town shall utilize the funds to complete the required work.
Section 4.14.02 Driveway Criteria
a. Driveway Aprons: Driveway aprons, consisting of bituminous concrete pavement or concrete pavement, shall be provided at each intersection of a driveway with an abutting town road. The driveway apron is that portion of the driveway extending from the town road pavement to the right-of-way line of the town road or to a distance of ten (10) feet in from the edge of the town road pavement, whichever is greater. In the case of uncertainty as to the true location of a town road right-of-way line, for the purposes of this section a reference right-of-way line shall be established by measuring twenty-five (25) feet from the centerline of the existing road pavement for a Minor Local Street and a Secondary Local Street, and thirty (30) feet from the centerline of the existing road pavement for a Major Local Street. However, this clause shall not be construed as establishing any rights in ownership of land, its purpose being merely to establish a reference line for driveway improvement purposes. Where a town road adjacent to a proposed driveway does not have any type of bituminous surface course, the Director of Public Works may waive the requirement for a bituminous concrete driveway apron.
All driveway aprons shall be constructed with a minimum lip of one and one-half (1½) inches at the town road gutter line. If a driveway apron is constructed prior to the placement of the top or surface course of a subdivision road to be dedicated to the Town of Coventry at some future date, then the driveway lip shall be increased in height so that after completion of the road construction, a minimum lip of one and one-half (1½) inches is maintained.
b. Driveway Surfaces (Revised - Effective 08/01/11): Individual driveways for single-family homes need not be paved but shall have a compact, non-erosive surface. For all other types of residential uses, including two-family dwellings and common driveways for two or more single-family homes, driveways and driveway aprons shall have paved surfaces consisting of a minimum of two (2) inches, after compaction, of Class II bituminous concrete placed on a minimum of eight (8) inches, after compaction, of processed aggregate base or eight (8) inches of bank run gravel and four (4) inches of
39
processed gravel, unless the Commission expressly allows the use of alternative materials. Class II "Bituminous Concrete" and "Processed Aggregate Base" materials shall conform to the State of Connecticut Standard Specifications Sections M.04.01, M.04.03, and M.05.01 respectively. The Commission may also, upon request, approve the use of alternative driveway surfaces, which shall consist of a non-erodible, all-weather surface including, but not necessarily limited to, bituminous concrete pavement; concrete pavement; brick, concrete or stone pavers; penetration macadam or chip seal; and porous paving systems using concrete or plastic grid structures.
c. Driveway Width:
1. Unpaved driveways are required to be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and a maximum of twenty (20) feet in width. When driveways are required to be paved in accordance with these Regulations or any permits issued under these Regulations, the driveways shall have a minimum pavement width of ten (10) feet, and a maximum pavement width of twenty (20) feet. The minimum corner or curb radius at the intersection of a town road and driveway shall be five (5) feet. All brush, trees, and any other obstructions shall be cleared and removed for a distance of three (3) feet beyond the edge of pavement along both sides of the entire length of the driveway.
2. Except as hereafter provided, common driveways shall have a paved surface no less than twelve (12) feet wide with load-bearing shoulders at least four (4) feet wide on each side. The Commission may allow a reduction in these widths if the applicant demonstrates that physical constraints, such as wetlands or steep slopes, would make it exceptionally difficult to construct a driveway having such widths. Examples of exceptional difficulty include possible negative environmental impacts, such as wetlands degradation and erosion/sedimentation hazards. (Revised  Effective 06/08/15)
d. Side Line Setback: The side or edge of a driveway shall not be located any closer than five (5) feet from an adjacent property line, except where a common driveway or curb cut is provided to serve more than one lot, in which case such setback shall only apply to a property line of an adjacent lot which is not served by the common driveway or curb cut. In addition, the point at which the driveway curb radius intersects the edge of pavement or curb line of a town road shall not encroach beyond the point where the extension of the property line meets the town road, except in the case of a common driveway or curb cut, where such requirements shall only apply to an adjacent lot which is not served by the common driveway or curb cut.
e. Sight Distance: The visibility at driveway intersections with town roads shall be such as to allow a stopped vehicle on the driveway, located six (6) feet back from the gutter line, to see, and to be seen from, a vehicle approaching from either direction along the town road, a distance of not less than one hundred seventy-five (175) feet, based on a height of eye and object of 3.5 feet. The Director of Public Works may require the removal of sight obstructions including but not limited to trees, bushes, shrubs, boulders, rocks, and stonewalls, or adjustments of cut slopes, adjacent to intersections of a private driveway with a town road in order to assure an adequate sight distance and to ensure a safe and efficient means of access for emergency vehicles.
f. Gradient: Driveway grades within the street right-of-way shall not exceed eight (8) percent, and within private property shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent.
g. Ascending Driveways: Driveways that ascend into private property shall be surfaced and maintained with a suitable material from the driveway apron to the high point in the driveway to prevent and disallow erosion and sedimentation. Unless otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works,
40
driveways shall be cross sloped so as to establish sheet flow drainage and avoid the discharge of concentrated runoff into town roads.
h. Descending Driveways: For driveways that descend into private property, driveway aprons shall rise in elevation from the town road gutter line to the town road right-of-way line a minimum of six (6) inches before descending into the property.
i. Turnouts: On driveways exceeding a total length of three hundred (300) feet, turnouts with a minimum width of ten (10) feet and a minimum length of (30) feet shall be provided for each three hundred (300) feet of driveway length to permit a vehicle to pull off the driveway so that another vehicle may safely pass without leaving the driveway surface. A common driveway that possesses a minimum travel surface width of twenty (20) feet is not required to have turnouts.
j. Drainage: Driveways shall be constructed in such a manner that they do not permit the runoff of water from the abutting town road to enter into the property of the owner, or adjacent properties, thereby creating a nuisance to the Town and the property owner, unless an easement in a form satisfactory to the to the Town of Coventry is granted by such owner to the Town for such runoff. Under no circumstances shall a driveway apron be constructed so as to obstruct or alter the free flow of water in the road gutter line or other drainage ways of the Town of Coventry.
k. Driveway Culverts: Where culverts under driveways are required by the Director of Public Works within the Town road right-of-way, such culverts shall be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe or high density corrugated polyethylene smooth interior pipe, and shall be of such size, not less than fifteen (15) inches in diameter, as to adequately convey under the driveway all surface runoff that may reasonably be expected to reach the culvert inlet during a storm with a 10-year recurrence interval. All culverts shall be of such design to withstand AASHTO H-20 loadings and shall have a minimum cover over the top of the culvert of one (1) foot, unless otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized representative. Culverts shall be placed on a minimum eight (8) inch depth bed of 1/2-inch crushed stone, and, shall be backfilled with 1/2inch crushed stone to a minimum dimension of six (6) inches around the outside perimeter of the pipe with a layer of filter fabric placed on top of the crushed stone. Inlet and outlet ends of culverts shall have flared end sections.
l. Removal of Guide Rails: Any driveway installation that requires the removal of a portion of a guide rail shall be secured with concrete end anchorages on each side of the driveway. All such work shall be the responsibility, and at the expense of, the applicant.
m. Disturbance of Monuments: Driveways shall be located and constructed such that no disturbance of road right-of-way monumentation occurs. In the event of accidental disturbance of a monument, the owner of the property served by the driveway shall be responsible for retaining and paying for the services of a land surveyor licensed in the State of Connecticut to reset the monument and to provide a Letter of Certification to the Director of Public Works. Where driveways are constructed on new roads which have not yet been monumented, they shall be located so as not to interfere with the future placement of monuments.
n. Final Grading and Stabilization: Where grading is required in a Town road right-of-way, slopes shall not be steeper than one (1) unit vertical to two (2) units horizontal, and shall be covered with a minimum of six (6) inches of topsoil, and limed, fertilized, seeded and mulched.
41
Section 4.14.03 Certification of Certain Driveways
No final certificate of zoning compliance or building permit shall be issued for any lot on which a driveway has been constructed after November 13, 2006, to serve either (1) a rear lot, or (2) two or more lots (i.e., a common driveway) unless a licensed professional engineer certifies that the driveway has been constructed in full compliance with this Section 4.14.

Section 5.02 Off-Street Parking and Loading
Section 5.02.01 General Statement
a. Parking Areas: All buildings, structures, and uses of land shall be provided with a sufficient number of off-street motor vehicle parking spaces to meet the needs of persons who may reasonably be expected to use such buildings or structures or to make such uses of land. For the specific uses identified in Section 5.02.04, the minimum number of required parking spaces shall be as set forth in that section. However, the Commission may require additional parking spaces if it finds, based on information in the record that it is reasonable to expect such spaces to be required to accommodate the specific use or uses proposed or existing on the lot. Parking areas and spaces shall be constructed with suitable all-weather materials to minimize the generation and movement of dust and earth materials. Sufficient provisions must also be made for access to the buildings, structures, or uses by emergency vehicles, such as police, fire, and medical vehicles. No business activities may be conducted in any parking area.
b. Loading Areas: For all non-residential uses, adequate space shall be provided in suitable locations for the loading and unloading of goods and materials. In determining the adequacy and suitability of such space, the Commission shall be guided by the nature and intensity of the use, the volume, and nature of traffic expected to use such space, and the location of buildings and structures in relation to the street.
45
Section 5.02.02 Restrictions on Unregistered Motor Vehicles
Parking or storage of more than two (2) unregistered motor vehicles shall not be permitted on any residential property except within a building. Vehicles used on a farm are exempted, but such vehicles shall not be kept in any front yard. Unregistered motor vehicles may not be parked or stored on residential property for purposes of private sale, except that parking or storage for one such sale may be allowed every six (6) months. Such parking or storage shall not exceed a period of thirty (30) consecutive days. The six-month period described above shall commence on the last day of the most recently allowed parking or storage of a vehicle for sale.
Section 5.02.03 Location of Parking Facilities
a. General Rule: Except as provided hereafter, the parking and loading facilities required by these Regulations shall be provided on the same lot or premises with the structure or land use they are to serve. This requirement shall not apply to the temporary use of land for special events authorized or sponsored by the Town of Coventry. Whenever a formula for the minimum number of parking spaces under these Regulations would produce a fractional number, the number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number.
b. Collective Parking Areas: The Commission may, by site plan review and approval, allow the provision of a collective off-street parking area, or a group of such areas, on one or both of two or more adjacent or nearby lots. The total number of parking spaces in any such collective area or areas shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various buildings or uses computed separately. If the subject lots are not under unified ownership or control, the Commission may require that a suitable notice of lease be filed in the Coventry Land Records and in the Zoning Office as a condition precedent to the issuance of the special permit. The leases must bind each of the owners of the affected lots to permit access and parking and to provide for the maintenance of all parking areas, and shall provide sufficient parking spaces to meet the parking requirements for the use of the subject property.
c. Shared Use of Parking Spaces: The Commission may, by special permit, allow a specific number of parking spaces to be shared by more than one (1) building or use where evidence is provided to indicate that such buildings or uses will have peak occupancy or parking demand during different times of the day or week. In no event shall such joint use reduce the required parking for any building or use by more than twenty-five percent (25%).
d. Multiple Uses and Facilities: When two or more different uses are located on a single lot, the total amount of parking and/or loading spaces to be provided shall be the sum of the requirements for each individual use on the lot. The Commission may, subject to Site Plan Review in accordance with Section 7.02.06, herein, approve the joint use of space by two or more establishments on the same or on contiguous lots where the total capacity of such space is less than the sum of the spaces required for each use; provided that the Commission finds that the capacity to be provided will substantially meet the intent of the requirements by reason of variation in the probable time of maximum use by patrons or employees among such establishments, and further provided that such approval of such joint shall be automatically terminated upon the termination of any such establishments.
46
Section 5.02.04 Off-Street Parking Requirements
The following schedule of parking requirements shall apply (singularly for a single use and in combinations for more than one use) to the uses listed (not all of which may presently be permitted in any zone under these Regulations).

The Commission may require a greater thickness or higher specification of surfacing materials if high traffic volumes or heavy vehicle weights are anticipated. Owners of property used for nonresidential and multifamily residential purposes shall be responsible for regular maintenance of parking and loading areas so that the surface of such areas remains free of puddles, icing, potholes, erosion, dust, and similar defects, and is usable during all weather Conditions.
c. Circulation: Parking and loading facilities for nonresidential and multifamily residential purposes shall be designed to provide for safe circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the parking area and in relation to adjacent streets. Such facilities shall be laid out in such a way that vehicles may enter and leave the facilities only at the approved entrances and exits. Parking spaces shall not be directly accessible from a street or other public way. Where trucks are to be admitted to parking lots, suitable turning and maneuvering geometry shall be provided. The Commission may require sidewalks if, and in such locations as, circumstances may warrant. No sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling, or servicing of any kind shall be carried on in non-residential parking spaces or lots. All parking spaces and all loading spaces shall be so located that vehicles entering or leaving such spaces do not block any entrance drive to the parking facility within twenty (20) feet of any street line. Driveways entering a State highway shall be provided with a turning area so that motor vehicles may enter the highway in a forward direction.

In every parking facility at least one healthy, living tree shall be provided for each ten (10) parking spaces
49
provided. The trees shall be distributed over the entire parking lot. At the time of planting, deciduous trees shall have a diameter of at least two and one-half (2.5) inches when measured at a height of four (4) feet from the ground. Evergreen trees shall have a height of no less than six (6) feet at the time of planting. All parking and loading areas shall utilize landscaped islands to define and separate parking rows, maneuvering lanes, and access driveways to prevent random vehicular movement and the appearance of large areas of uninterrupted pavement. The capacity of any parking area shall not exceed seventy-five (75) spaces, and where more parking is required, two (2) or more parking areas shall be provided, separated by a minimum of ten (10') feet of landscaped area.
e. Screening: Loading areas and dumpster/recycling areas shall be screened by fences, walls, or landscaped screens. Non-residential parking and loading areas shall be screened from adjacent residential uses; provided, however, that required screening along streets may be modified where required to provide safe sight lines. Provisions shall be made to prevent vehicles from overhanging any walkway and from damaging trees or other landscaping materials; however, use of concrete wheel stops shall be prohibited in the direct path of pedestrians. If a parking lot abuts a street line, a landscaped strip at least ten (10) feet wide shall be provided on the interior side of the property line to prevent encroachment on the street or any sidewalk.
f. Drainage: All parking areas for principal uses other than single-family or two-family dwellings shall provide for proper drainage and snow removal. All stormwater drainage systems shall provide for the trapping and removal of road sand and other water-borne debris.

Section 5.03.02 General Provisions
Except as provided in Section 5.03.03 of these Regulations, earth removal, and filling as a separate, for-profit use of land may be allowed only upon the issuance of a special permit. Earth removal and filling may also be allowed as of right, but only where such activities are incidental to and necessary for the conduct of another use otherwise permitted in the zone, and only in accordance with these Regulations.
Section 5.03.03 Exemptions; Administrative Review
A special permit shall not be required for the necessary and incidental excavation or removal of three hundred (300) cubic yards or less per year of material on or from a lot or parcel, or for any filling activity, only if such activity occurs in connection with one of the following items a through f.
For activities involving the excavation or removal of three hundred (300) cubic yards per year or less [and not otherwise exempt under a through f below], the property owner shall provide the Zoning Enforcement Officer with such information described in Section 5.03.04 below as such officer shall deem necessary to make an administrative determination that the proposed activity will not result in any adverse erosion, sedimentation, runoff or other negative on-site or off-site impacts. If the Zoning Enforcement Officer is unable to conclude that no such impacts will exist, the property owner may apply to the Commission for a special permit as provided herein. In addition, the Zoning Enforcement Officer (or his/her designee) shall have the right to inspect the premises on which the activity is taking place in order to ensure that no erosion or sedimentation control hazards or other threats to the environment exist. If any such hazards or threats or other issues deemed significant arise during or after the each excavation activities, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may require the submission of a site plan substantially in the form required under Section 5.03.04.
In all instances, the property owner shall apply all necessary erosion and sedimentation control measures as per the current versions of the Connecticut Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment Control.
(Revised  Effective 06/15/12)
a. The bona-fide construction or alteration of a structure for which a zoning permit or special permit has been issued, provided that the application materials specified the amount of material to be removed or filled.

The following standards shall be applied to home occupations in all three categories: (i) the use must be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the principal building as the residence of one or more persons conducting the use; (ii) no more than two home occupations are permitted per dwelling unit: (iii) the use must not change the residential character of the dwelling; (iv) no more than ten (10) non-residents may be employed on the premises; (v) accessory buildings and structures may be used for home occupations, provided that the other requirements of Section 5.05 are met; (vi) the total floor area used for the home occupations may not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the total finished floor area of the dwelling unit used by the person(s) conducting the home occupation or three thousand (3,000) square feet, whichever is less; (vii) persons who offer professional or personal services on site, including but not limited to doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, barbers and beauticians, shall conduct business on an appointment-only basis in order to manage parking requirements and minimize traffic conflicts; no clients or patients shall be housed overnight; (viii) no more than three (3) commercial-type vehicles, not to exceed 11,000 pounds gross weight per vehicle, may be parked on the site (for purposes of this section, commercial-type vehicle shall mean any motor vehicle other than an automobile, sport utility vehicle, motorcycle, mini-van, pick-up truck, or similar vehicle customarily used for personal transportation, or a farm, lawn or garden tractor); and (ix) except for fruits, vegetables, and other produce grown on the premises, no merchandise may be displayed so as to be visible from the street.
a. Low Impact Home Occupations (LIHOs)
60
The Zoning Agent may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any home occupation that satisfies the requirements of Section 5.05.01 and other pertinent provisions of these Regulations, provided the following additional standards are met:
1) No more than one (1) commercial-type vehicle for the home occupation, not to exceed 11,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, will be parked on the premises.
2) The home occupation is one that does not involve on-site sales, classes, personal services, or other nonresidential activities likely to attract or require visits by persons who do not reside on the premises.
3) No portion of the home occupation will be conducted outside of the principal or accessory buildings and, except for permitted signs, there shall be no visible evidence or indication of the operation from outside any building or structure used for the home occupation.
4) No more than two (2) persons may be employed in the home occupation who does not reside on the premises.
5) The total floor area for all home occupations permitted on the lot would not exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet.
LIHOs include, but are not limited to, the production (but not the on-site sale) of arts, crafts, home preserves, and knitted, sewn or baked goods; as well as the offices of plumbers, house painters, electricians, and other persons whose services are not performed on the residential parcel. LIHOs are not required to provide additional off-street parking spaces for visitors, as required for MIHOs and HIHOs. Each LIHO may place one free-standing identification sign, not to exceed four (4) square feet in total sign area, on a mailbox or a light post at the site of the home occupation; plus one identification sign, not to exceed two (2) square feet in total sign area, on or near the entrance to the building in which the home occupation is conducted. LIHOs shall be deemed to be accessory uses to a primary residential use. A home occupation that exists on a state highway is permitted to have one (1) free-standing identification sign, not to exceed (8) square feet in total sign area, on a mailbox or a light post at the site at the site of the home occupation. (Revised Effective 06/15/12)
b. Moderate Impact Home Occupations (MIHOs)
The Zoning Agent may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any home occupation that would satisfy the standards for a LIHO, as set forth in subsection a, above, except that the use either (i) involves minor on-site sales, classes, or services; and/or (ii) involves the parking of no more than two commercial-type vehicles, each not to exceed 11,000 pounds gross vehicle weight; and/or (iii) would employ up to, but not more than, two (2) persons who do not reside on the premises. However, the following additional requirements must be met by any such home occupation:
1) The applicant must submit to the Zoning Agent a written estimation of the average and peak number of vehicles likely to enter and exit the site on both an hourly and daily basis, as well as a written explanation of how the numbers were estimated.
2) The estimated vehicle numbers must not exceed either (i) an average of two vehicles per hour in any one day or ten vehicles per day in one week (Sunday through Saturday), or (ii) a peak of four vehicles in any hour or fifteen vehicles in any day.
61
3) The Zoning Agent must determine, based upon all available information, that the applicants estimates are reasonable. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance issued under this section may be revoked if the home occupation is later found to have generated vehicle trips in excess of the limits estimated by the applicant.
4) Enough additional parking spaces must be provided to alleviate the need to use Town roads for customer or employee parking. MIHOs shall provide at least two (2) off-street parking spaces for visitors and one (1) off-street parking space for each non-resident-employee.
Each MIHO shall be allowed the same type and number of signs as permitted for LIHOs pursuant to subsection a, above. MIHOs shall be deemed to be accessory uses to a primary residential use.
c. High Impact Home Occupations (HIHOs)
The Commission may grant a special permit for home occupations that satisfy the general standards of this Section 5.05.01 but do not satisfy the standards for a LIHO or a MIHO. In addition to the requirements for a special permit, HIHOs must also satisfy the following standards:
1) No such home occupation shall be permitted on a lot having an area of less than 220,000 square feet (five (5) acres).
2) The Commission shall require such screening as it may determine, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to preserve the residential character of the lot and neighborhood. Such screening shall always include, but shall not to be limited to, vegetative buffers to fully screen commercial-type vehicles and parking areas serving five or more vehicles from abutting roads and properties.
3) Enough additional parking spaces shall be provided to alleviate the need to use Town roads for customer or employee parking. A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be provided for visitors and one (1) off-street parking space for each non-resident-employee. However, the Commission may require additional off-street parking spaces if the record indicates that there may be a need for such spaces.
4) The Commission may allow the parking of vehicles in excess of 11,000 pounds gross weight per vehicle.
Each HIHO shall be allowed the same type and number of signs as permitted for LILOs and MIHOs pursuant to subsections a. and b. above.
d. Multiple Home Occupations
The Zoning Agent may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for two home occupations on any one lot, provided the home occupations would individually and collectively satisfy the standards for a combination of LIHOs or MIHOs, as set forth in subsection a, above. The Commission may grant a special permit to allow two home occupations on any one lot when at least one of the home occupations is a MIHO or HIHO, as specified in subsections b and c, above, and the home occupations would individually and collectively satisfy all of the other standards of Section 5.05.
62
Section 5.05.02 Revocation of Permit
Any permit issued by the Zoning Agent or the Commission for a home occupation under these Regulations shall be limited to the specific use described in the application and shall be contingent upon continuous satisfaction of the standards and criteria set forth in this Section 5.05 and all other relevant provisions of these Regulations. The Zoning Agent may revoke a permit for a home occupation only if such permit was issued by the Zoning Agent and only if the Zoning Agent determines that there has been a substantial or material change in the nature of the permitted use or that the permittee has failed to comply with any applicable provision of these Regulations. Any such revocation by the Zoning Agent shall be subject to an appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Commission may revoke any permit issued for a home occupation if the Commission determines, after a hearing for which the property owner has been given at least ten (10) days advance written notice, that there has been a substantial or material change in the nature of the permitted use or that the permittee has failed to comply with any applicable provision of these Regulations. Any such revocation by the Commission shall be subject to appeal to the Superior Court only.

Substantial Improvement  Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure taking place during the life of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be: 1) The appraised value of the structure using the cost approach value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 2) In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.
43. Substantial Damage  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged conditions would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
44. Variance  A grant of relief from the requirements of these Regulations which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by these Regulations, where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship, and where the granting of such relief would be in harmony with the purposes of these Regulations.

Section 5.06.03 General Provisions
a. Lands to Which This Regulation Applies: This Section 5.06 shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the Town of Coventry.
b. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the Town of Coventry, Connecticut, dated December 4, 1979 and accompanying Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), dated June 11, 1982, and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), dated June 11, 1982, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of Coventry, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and A1-A30 including areas designated as a floodway on a FBFM or FIRM. SFHA determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the FIS for a community. BFEs provided on a FIRM are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. (Revised - Effective 06/15/12)
c. Establishment of the Floodplain Management Program: A special permit or Certificate of Zoning Compliance, as hereinafter provided, shall be required in conformance with the provisions of these Regulations prior to the commencement of any development activities.
d. Compliance: No structure, manufactured home, or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section 5.06 and other applicable regulations.
e. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this Section 5.06 is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Section 5.06 does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Section 5.06 shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Coventry or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Section 5.06 or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
f. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Added - Effective 06/15/12)
Section 5.06.04 Procedure
a. Prior to the commencement of any development in designated Flood Hazard Zones A-1 through A-30 and unnumbered A Zones, an application with accompanying information shall be submitted to the Commission for its review. To promote expedient review, applications should be filed in the Planning Office at least seven (7) days prior to a regular meeting for analysis and placement on the Agenda. Upon receipt of the application, the Commission shall review the proposal and determine whether special permit approval or a Certificate of Zoning Compliance authorization is appropriate. Prior
69
to this determination, all proposals under these Regulations shall be considered special permit applications. (Revised - Effective 06/15/12)
b. If the proposal involves a minor land disturbing activity, accessory structure, or minor addition that is clearly consistent with the approval criteria contained in these Regulations, the Commission may authorize the Zoning Agent to issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance. All other proposed activities shall require special permit approval and a public hearing date shall be established. After conducting the public hearing, the Commission shall complete its review and approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application.
c. The Commission shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of Environmental Protection prior to any alteration of the course or location of a watercourse, and shall submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
d. A permit may be given that allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirements of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1, Subsection 65.12.
Section 5.06.05 Application Requirements
It is recommended that the planning staff be contacted for assistance in determining what information may be required by the Commission. Whereas all applications are initially considered special permits, the application requirements of Section 7 for special permits shall be followed. At a minimum, all applications shall include a site plan showing property lines, existing and proposed contours, existing and proposed structures and floor elevations, base flood information, appropriate engineering certifications, appropriate construction plans and other data necessary to accurately review the proposal with respect to approval criteria. Specific base flood elevation data shall be provided for proposals greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, for that portion within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
Section 5.06.06 Flood Hazard Zones/Base Flood Information
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with this Section 5.06, then the Zoning Agent shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in any area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community comply with these Regulations.
Where base flood elevation data are utilized, the Town shall obtain and maintain records of lowest floor and flood proofing elevations for new construction and substantial improvements.
Section 5.06.07 Approval Criteria
The permittee is hereby advised that federal or state permits may be required in addition to any permits or approvals required under these Regulations.
70
In reviewing and authorizing any development in any Special Flood Hazard Area, the Commission must determine that the public's health, welfare and general safety have been protected and that the following specific procedures and criteria have been followed or met to the Commission's satisfaction:
a. If specific federal or state permit requirements are known, the Commission may require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the (development/ building/zoning) permit. Such additional permit requirements may include, but are not necessarily limited to: Stream Channel Encroachment Line Permit, Coastal Area Management Permit, Water Diversion Permit, Dam Safety Permit, Corps of Engineers 401 and 404 Permits.

d. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure located in Zone A1-30, AO and AH shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least to or above the level of the base flood elevation. Non-residential structures located in all A-Zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that, together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, the areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this Section 5.06. Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Agent. (Revised  Effective 06/15/12)
e. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
1) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and
3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
f. All development proposals, including utilities and drainage, must be located and designed to be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. More specifically:
1) All public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
71
2) New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
4) Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards and access to proposed developments shall not be impaired due to flood hazards.
5) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
6) New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage and with materials resistant to flood damage; (Added  Effective 06/15/12)
7) Anchoring shall be provided as necessary to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. (Added  Effective 06/15/12)
g. The flood carrying capacity must be maintained within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourse. Engineering certification shall be submitted with the application.
h. New construction, including prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes, and substantial improvements must be designed and anchored to prevent flotation collapse or lateral movement and constructed with flood-resistant materials and methods. The placement of manufactured homes and subdivisions shall meet the location, anchoring, and other construction standards, and evacuation requirements contained in the National Flood Insurance Program Rules and Regulations.
i. Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas designated as floodways on the communitys Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM). Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and any other development, are prohibited in the Floodway unless certification (with supporting technical data) is provided by a registered licensed professional engineer demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, through that such encroachments will not result in) any (0.00 feet increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences located in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A permit may be given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirements of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1, Subsection 65.12. (Revised  Effective 06/15/12)
The Zoning Agent may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the municipalitys request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community. (Added  Effective 06/15/12)
j. If the proposal involves development within Zones A-1 through A-30, and a floodway has not been identified, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including
72
fill) shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community. (Revised  Effective 06/15/12)
k. All manufactured homes (including "mobile" homes and recreational vehicles placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer) to be placed, or substantially improved, in a Special Flood Hazard Area shall be elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation; and shall be placed on a permanent foundation that itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but are not limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than 10 feet apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six (6') feet above ground level. Adequate access and drainage should be provided. This includes manufactured homes located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood. (Revised - Effective 06/15/12)
Recreational vehicles placed in any Special Flood Hazard Area must meet the foregoing requirements unless they are fully licensed and ready for highway use, as defined below, and are moved out of the Special Flood Hazard Area within 180 days after first being placed there. A recreational vehicle shall be deemed to be ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
Section 5.06.08 As-Built Plans Required
Prior to issuance of any Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any approved development activities in any Special Flood Hazard Area, the Zoning Agent shall determine that approved plans and elevation requirements have been met. To verify compliance, "as built" first floor and basement elevations and final ground elevations certified by a properly licensed professional engineer or land surveyor shall be submitted to the Zoning Agent for authorized primary structures, major additions, major land disturbing activities or any other development activity where, in the opinion of the Zoning Agent, certifications are necessary. Where flood proofing measures have been utilized or watercourses altered, appropriate "as built" or "as constructed" certifications from a professional engineer or architect shall be submitted to the Zoning Agent.
Section 5.06.09 Variance Procedures
Any applicant may request a variance of these standards from the Coventry Zoning Board of Appeals. Variance applicants are hereby notified that approval to construct a structure below base flood levels will increase risks to life and property and will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance. A record of all variance actions shall be maintained in the Planning Office and reported annually to the Federal Insurance Administrator. All variances shall meet the following standards:
73
a. Variances may be issued without regard to the standards of this section for the reconstruction, restoration, and rehabilitation of structures on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places.
b. Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and result in the loss of historic designation of the building.
d. Variances shall be granted only upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause.
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in undue hardship to the applicant. Only hardships that are based on unusual physical characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall qualify for a variance. Claims of hardship based on the structure, or on economic or personal circumstances, are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance under these Regulations.
3. A determination that the granting of a variance would not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
e. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for each $100 of insurance coverage.
f. The Zoning Agent shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its biennial report. (Revised - Effective 06/15/12)
Section 5.07 Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, and Structures
Section 5.07.01 Continuance of Nonconforming Uses and Structures
Any nonconforming use, building, or structure, lawfully existing as of the effective date of these Regulations or any amendment thereof, shall be permitted to continue notwithstanding any other provision of these Regulations or any amendment thereof.
Section 5.07.02 Change of Use
Any use that conforms to these Regulations may not be changed to a nonconforming use. Except as provided below, a nonconforming use may be changed only to a conforming use. Whenever a
74
nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use that does not conform to these Regulations.
The Commission may grant a special permit for a change in one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, but only in the unusual and limited circumstances described in this Section 5.07.02. In addition to all of the standards and requirements for special permits set forth in Section 7.03 of these Regulations, the applicant must prove, to the satisfaction of the Commission:
a. That no conforming use can reasonably be made of the parcel due to conditions especially affecting the parcel, but not generally affecting other land in the zoning district in which the parcel is situated.
b. That the proposed new nonconforming use is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare and with the character and the appropriate and orderly development of the neighborhood, adjacent properties, and zoning districts;
c. That the proposed new nonconforming use will create no greater impact on the property, the neighborhood, adjacent properties and zoning districts in terms of parking, volumes and types of traffic, property values, hours of operation, exterior appearance of the building, structure or lot, or any other factors that may properly be considered by the Commission pursuant to Section 7.03.
Section 5.07.03 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Uses
a. General Prohibition: No nonconforming use shall be extended or enlarged inside or outside any building or structure except as otherwise provided herein. The addition of one or more dwelling or nonresidential units within or to a building shall be considered to be an unlawful extension or expansion if the resulting number of dwelling or nonresidential units would exceed the number of such units permissible under these current Regulations.
b. Exception for Long-Established Uses: The Commission may grant a special permit for the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use that has existed continuously for no less than twenty-five (25) years prior to the date of approval of such special permit, provided that the area of such enlargement or extension shall not be greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total area (including all floor areas and outside areas) that are lawfully being utilized for the nonconforming use immediately prior to the time the special permit is granted. The Commissions intention in establishing this exception is to recognize that uses that have existed continuously for very long periods of time may often form an integral part of the intrinsic character of the neighborhood in which they are located, even though the use may not be consistent with the current zoning district. Nonetheless, nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to require the Commission to issue a special permit for any such extension or expansion or to find that an existing nonconforming use is integral to the character of its neighborhood.
c. Nonconforming Single-Family Dwellings: When an existing single-family dwelling is nonconforming because it is located in a zone in which single-family dwellings are not otherwise permitted, or are permitted (as, for example, in the Professional Office Zone) only on lots that also have a nonresidential use, the gross floor area of such dwellings may be increased by up to 15 percent above the amount of gross floor area that existed on the later of (1) the date such dwelling became nonconforming or (2) November 13, 2006.
75
Section 5.07.04 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Structures
Except as provided below, no nonconforming building or structure shall be enlarged or altered in such manner as to increase the nonconformity of such building or structure. In the event a residential dwelling is lawfully nonconforming with respect to a required yard or setback, the nonconforming portion of such dwelling may be increased in height or area, provided (i) the expanded portion of the building does not extend further into the side or rear yards or setback areas, and is not closer to the front lot line, than the original nonconforming portion of the building; and (ii) the distance between any portion of the nonconforming dwelling and the nearest existing residential dwelling on any adjoining lot is not less than the sum of the two minimum yards that would otherwise be required by the Regulations on either side of the mutual property line. Nothing in this section of the Regulations shall be deemed to allow a nonconforming building or structure to be expanded in such a manner as to exceed the maximum height allowable in the relevant zoning district. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no extension or enlargement of any building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted.
Section 5.07.05 Moving
No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot on which it was located on the effective date of adoption or amendment of the relevant provisions of these Regulations.
Section 5.07.06 Alterations and Repairs
A building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be altered or improved, but not extended or enlarged, and may be repaired or reconstructed as made necessary by wear and tear or deterioration. The alteration or repair of any structure within a special flood hazard area shall comply with the flood damage prevention regulations set forth in Section 5.06.
Section 5.07.07 Restoration
Any nonconforming building or structure which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, flood, or any act of God or act of public enemy may be restored to the same dimensions, floor area, cubic volume, density, and site location as existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction, provided such restoration is commenced within one (1) year, and completed within two (2) years of such damage or destruction.
Section 5.07.08 Discontinuance or Abandonment
Any nonconforming use that has ceased by voluntary discontinuance or abandonment for a period of one (1) year shall thereafter conform to the provisions of these Regulations. Any landowner who intends to resume a nonconforming use that has previously ceased or been discontinued must, within one (1) year of the cessation or discontinuance of the use or within one (1) year after the effective date of this provision, whichever is later, file a notice of such intent with the Commission. Any landowner who has not filed such a notice and who wishes to recommence a nonconforming use must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that he or she did not intend to abandon such use.
76
Section 5.07.09 Illegal Use
Nothing in these Regulations shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of, the continuation of any use of land, building, structure, or premises that, when commenced or first established, was in violation of the Zoning Regulations then in effect and that has never been legally validated by any amendment to such Regulations or by any provision of State law.
Section 5.07.10 Safety
Nothing in these Regulations shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by a proper authority, or determined to be unsafe by the Town Engineer or Building Official.
Section 5.07.11 Construction Begun and/or Permits or Variances Issued Prior to Adoption or Amendment of Regulations or Zone Change
Nothing in these Regulations, or any amendment thereof, or in any subsequent change in zoning classification, shall be deemed to require any alteration in the plans, construction, or designated use of a building, structure, or premises for which (i) a zoning permit has been issued before the effective date of the relevant Regulations, amendment, or change in zoning classification; and (ii) construction has been commenced, provided the entire building or structure is completed within two (2) years from such effective date. If any of the foregoing provisions are not met, the zoning permit shall become null and void.
Nothing in these Regulations, or any amendment thereof, or in any subsequent change in zoning classification, shall be deemed to require any change in plans, construction, or designated use of a building, structure, or premises for which a special permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the relevant Regulations, amendment, or change in zoning classification, provided (i) a building permit is obtained within two (2) years from such effective date; (ii) substantial construction is commenced within two (2) years of the date of issuance of such building permit; and (iii) the entire building or structure is completed according to the approved plans within three (3) years from the date of issuance of the building permit. If any of the foregoing provisions are not met, the special permit shall become null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no improvements, or proposed improvements shown on a site plan for residential property that has been approved prior to the effective date of a change in the Zoning Regulations or zoning classification and has been filed or recorded with the Coventry Town Clerk shall be required to conform to such change.
Section 5.07.12 Procedure for Determining Status of Nonconforming Uses
a. Reservation of Power to Determine Status. The Commission hereby reserves the power to determine, by declaratory ruling, whether any building, structure, or use is lawfully nonconforming. However, this power may be exercised only in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in this Section 5.07.12.
b. Authority of Zoning Enforcement Officer. The reservation of power set forth in Section 5.07.12.a shall not preclude, nor be deemed to prevent, the Zoning Agent from issuing an enforcement
77
order against any person who is erecting, constructing, establishing, maintaining or conducting any building, structure or use that is not in conformance with these Regulations and that has not previously been determined to be a lawful nonconforming use by declaratory ruling pursuant to this Section 5.07.12.
c. Conditions for Issuance of Declaratory Ruling. The Commission may issue a declaratory ruling pursuant to the power reserved under Section 5.07.12.a only upon application for such ruling by an owner or user of the building, structure, or land in question, or by a person authorized in writing by the owner or user to file such application. No such application shall be accepted or processed if the Zoning Agent has issued an enforcement order against the erection, construction, establishment, maintenance, or conduct of the building, structure, or use in question and the order is still pending. In such circumstances, the person subject to the order shall be entitled to have the matter considered only by proper appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Section 8.02 of these Regulations.
d. Procedure for Issuance of Declaratory Ruling. Upon submission of a proper application for a declaratory ruling, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.07.12.c, the Commission shall schedule a public hearing on such application. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the Town of Coventry at least twice at intervals of not less than two days, the first not more than fifteen nor less than ten days before the hearing, and the second no less than two days before the hearing. Due notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the applicant. The time limits for action upon such application shall be the same as the time limits established for action upon an application for a special permit pursuant to Section 7.03 of these Regulations. Notice of the Commission's decision shall be published and sent to the applicant in the same manner as notice of the decision on an application for a special permit pursuant to Section 7.03 of these Regulations.
e. Criteria for Determination of Status - Uses. A use shall be determined to be nonconforming only if the Commission finds that the use meets all of the following criteria:
1. That the use is not presently in conformance with all requirements of these Regulations.
2. That, at the time it commenced, the use was otherwise lawful and was in conformance with all requirements of the Zoning Regulations then in force, if any.
3. That the use was not abandoned discontinued or changed to a conforming use after it commenced or, if it was abandoned, discontinued or changed and later resumed, the use was otherwise lawful and was in conformance with all requirements of the Zoning Regulations in force, if any, when the use was resumed.
4. That the character of the use has not been substantially changed, and the use has not been extended or expanded, since the effective date of any provisions of those Regulations with which the use does not presently comply. An intensification of a lawful nonconforming use, such as an increase in the volume of business conducted, shall not be considered to be an extension or expansion provided the intensification does not substantially change the character of the use, does not involve any structural alterations to buildings or structures, and does not involve the dedication to such use of a greater area of the lot or parcel on which it is located.
f. Criteria for Determination of Status - Buildings and Structures. A building or structure shall be determined to be nonconforming only if Commission finds that the building or structure meets all of the following criteria:
78
1. That the building or structure is not presently in conformance with all requirements of these Regulations.
2. That, at the time it was erected, constructed, or altered, the building or structure, was otherwise lawful and was in conformance with all requirements of the Zoning Regulations then in force, if any; or, if a building is situated on a lot that does not meet the present minimum area requirements of these Regulations, or is situated on a lot in such a way that it does not comply with the provisions of these Regulations concerning the location of such a building in relation to the boundaries of the lot, the building was so situated for at least three years without the institution of an action to enforce such requirements or provisions of the Regulations.
g. Appeal. An appeal from the Commission's decision may be taken to the Superior Court in the manner provided by Section 8-8 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Section 5.08 Alcoholic Liquor
Section 5.08.01 Definition of Terms
All words used in this Section 5.08 that are not defined in these Regulations, but are defined in Chapter 545 of the Connecticut General Statutes, known as the Liquor Control Act, shall be deemed to have the same definitions for purposes of Section 5.08.

In cases of question about the category in which any particular permit shall be classified, the Commission shall utilize that category within which the most similar types of permits are found.
Section 5.08.03 Zone Restrictions for Certain Classes of Permits
Class 1, 2, 3 and 5 shall be prohibited in the GR, LR, and River/Aquifer Zones.
Section 5.08.04 Special Permit Required
No building, lot, or permit premises shall be used, or altered, extended or enlarged for use, for the sale or exchange of alcoholic or spirituous liquors at wholesale or retail, whether for consumption on the premises or otherwise, or for the storage of spirituous or alcoholic liquors for purposes of sale or exchange, unless and until a special permit for such use has been approved by the Commission.
Section 5.09 Telecommunications Facilities
Section 5.09.01 Definitions
As used in this Section 5.09 of these Regulations, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Antenna" means any device used to receive or to transmit electromagnetic waves, and includes, without limitation, whip antennas, dish antennas, and panel antennas.
"Relay facility" means any device used to receive electromagnetic waves from one or more points and to transmit those waves to one or more other points.
"Telecommunications facility" means any building, structure, or equipment used to receive or transmit electromagnetic waves.
"Tower" means a structure that is intended to support equipment used to receive or transmit electromagnetic waves, and that would be either (i) greater than sixty (60) feet in height if not affixed to a building, or more than twenty (20) feet higher in elevation than the highest point of the building to which it would be affixed.
Section 5.09.02 Purpose
Telecommunications facilities are regulated under a complex variety of federal, state, and local laws. The operation of certain federal and state laws and regulations supersedes local zoning requirements in some instances, but allows for municipal regulation in others.
80
Telecommunications facilities, including towers, antennas, and associated structures and equipment, can have profound effects on the character of communities such as Coventry. The Commission has therefore determined that such facilities should be carefully and thoughtfully managed pursuant to these Regulations to the extent not preempted or otherwise prohibited by state or federal laws or regulations.
Section 5.09.03 Application of Regulations
The provisions of Section 5.09 of these Regulations shall be used in evaluating all telecommunications facilities, with the understanding that the Commission's determination may be only advisory in some instances and may be superseded by a decision of a state or federal agency or official. In those instances, the Commission shall apply the provisions of Section 5.09 of these Regulations to the extent possible to propose to the controlling agency the decision that should be made and, as appropriate, any Conditions that should be applied to the proposed facilities. To the extent state and federal law allows the Commission to exercise full or partial zoning authority over a proposed telecommunications facility or facilities, the standards and procedures set forth in Section 5.09 of these Regulations shall be used in determining whether to approve such facilities and, as appropriate, the extent to which any permit should be conditioned or restricted. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to allow the Commission to regulate any telecommunications facility in any manner that is not authorized by, or is in conflict with, any applicable federal or state laws, or regulations.
Section 5.09.04 Type of Permit Required
Except as provided below, all telecommunications facilities that are, or are intended to be, the principal use of any lot or parcel of land shall be deemed to be uses allowed only by special permit. Such uses shall be specially permissible in any zone, but in order to minimize the detriment such facilities are likely to cause to the character and property values within residential neighborhoods and areas in Coventry, and to help preserve Coventry's rural nature and the tranquility of its residents, applicants are encouraged to locate towers in the C and C/A zones only. Telecommunications facilities that are accessory and subordinate uses to a principal or Accessory Use permitted under Article VI of these Regulations, and that do not require the construction or erection of a tower shall be permissible as of right without need for any separate permit, provided such principal or Accessory Use has been lawfully permitted or established.
Section 5.09.05 Application Procedure
The Commission shall not approve or recommend approval to any state or federal agency of any telecommunications facility unless the applicant for such facility submits one the following to the Commission or its authorized agent:
a. An application for a Special Permit or a Zoning Permit for such facility, whichever is appropriate; or
b. A written application for the Commission's review of such facility setting forth all applicable federal and state laws or regulations under which the Commission may review the application and under which the Commission's exercise of zoning powers is limited with respect to such facility. The applicant shall submit copies of all state and federal licenses necessary to operate such facility. The applicant shall also submit to the Commission the same types of information and materials as would be required by these Regulations if the Commission were authorized under state and federal law to exercise
81
its full zoning authority over such facility. The applicant's failure to submit any such information and materials shall be grounds for the Commission to recommend denial of the proposed facility to such state or federal agencies as may have jurisdiction.
Except as may be otherwise provided below, all applications must be accompanied, at a minimum, and in addition to any other documents and materials required by these Regulations, by the following:
1. A detailed site development plan based upon an A-2 survey. Plans for any tower shall include field developed topographic details, at a contour interval no greater than five feet, of the proposed tower location and all land within a horizontal distance equivalent to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the height of the tower. The plan must include, among other appropriate items, the proposed locations within the site of all proposed telecommunications facilities, including, to the extent applicable, any proposed locations of such facilities on towers, buildings or other structures;
2. Detailed architectural, engineering and construction plans, drawings and elevations, including cross-sections and elevations of any proposed tower, and written descriptions of all towers, antennas and mounting equipment, including size, design and color;
3. A detailed soil and erosion control plan;
4. Detailed driveway access construction plans including, among other items, drainage and utility plans;
5. Detailed landscaping and screening plans prepared by a licensed landscape designer;
6. The location of the fall zone of any proposed tower;
7. Details of proposed antenna and mounting equipment, including size and color;
8. Details of all proposed fencing, including color.
9. A description of the tower's capacity, including the number and type of antennas it can accommodate as well as the proposed location of all mounting positions for co-located antennas and the minimum separation distances between antennas.
10. A structural analysis of any proposed tower certified by a registered professional engineer demonstrating the adequacy of the design to support the required load and indicate any additional capacity provided for co-located antennas. If a pre-designed breakpoint has been incorporated, an illustration of how the tower will collapse shall be provided as well.
11. A report from a licensed engineer certifying that the installation of the proposed telecommunications facilities will not interfere with public safety communications.
12. Any additional information reasonably required by the Commission including, but not limited to:
a) an environmental assessment of the facility and/or access road;
82
b) radio frequency power density modeling and/or testing data;
c) a structural analysis of tower capacity.
13. Documentation regarding the availability of any existing or approved telecommunication tower or other structure within one mile of the proposed parcel that may meet the needs of the applicant, with particular regard to proposed towers.
14. A map depicting the extent of the provider's planned coverage within the Town of Coventry and the service area of the proposed facility.
15. Upon request of the Commission, the applicant shall provide a simulation of the proposed telecommunication facility in order to help the Commission ascertain the visual impacts associated with such proposal. If such a simulation is required, public notice of the time and place of such balloon elevation, and an alternate date in the case of unfavorable weather conditions, shall be published in the form of a legal advertisement appearing in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in Coventry at least seven (7) days before the elevation of such balloon.
The Commission may waive any of the requirements of this section if, and only if, the Commission determines that the requirements sought to be waived are not reasonably necessary to a proper disposition of the application. No waiver under this section shall be granted unless the applicant submits to the Commission, in writing, at the time of and together with the submission of the application, a request for a waiver specifying the requirements the applicant seeks to have waived and the reasons why the applicant believes those requirements should be waived. The Commission shall render a decision on any timely filed request for waiver within 35 days after the day of receipt of the application to which it pertains. If the Commission fails to act on any request for a waiver within such 35 days, the request for waiver shall be deemed to be denied.
Section 5.09.06 Criteria for Evaluation
The following criteria shall be used to evaluate the propriety of any proposed telecommunications facility and shall be supplemental to all other applicable criteria and standards set forth elsewhere in these Regulations, including, without limitation, Section 4.04 Dimensional Standards and Section 7.03 Special Permits.
a. Towers
1. Height: Towers shall be no taller than necessary to reasonably accommodate the proposed use of the tower. If the tower is proposed to be part of a telecommunications transmission network, such as a personal communications service network, but not including towers used solely for amateur radio communications, the applicant shall be required to provide adequate evidence that the height of the tower is no greater than reasonably necessary to accommodate the reception and transmission needs of the network. Such evidence shall include, without limitation, information on the current status of the network; the location(s) within the Town of Coventry or any Adjoining towns of all existing or proposed towers or other relay facilities within the network; the reception and transmission range of all such towers or relay facilities; and any alternative tower locations and heights reviewed by the applicant and the reasons such alternatives were not selected.
83
2. Location: The applicant shall be required to provide adequate information as to the reason for selecting the proposed tower location, including information on all alternative locations reviewed, the reasons such alternative locations were not selected, and why the tower is necessary to provide adequate telecommunications service. The applicant must also demonstrate that consideration has been given to placing the telecommunications equipment on existing buildings or structures, including existing towers, as opposed to constructing or erecting a new tower. The applicant must demonstrate that it has made reasonable efforts to minimize any negative impacts on the character of residential neighborhoods and areas and, if the tower is to be located in a residential zone, that the applicant has reasonably determined, based upon a specific and thorough investigation of potential alternative locations, that the applicant cannot provide adequate service without establishing a tower at the proposed location. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, an applicant for the construction or erection of a tower to be used for amateur radio communications originating from the parcel on which the tower is to be located shall only be required to demonstrate that the location of the tower on the parcel is reasonable and is designed to minimize negative impacts on other properties in the vicinity.
3. Fall Zone: The applicant shall provide an analysis by a licensed engineer of the potential fall zone of the proposed tower. The potential fall zone must be located entirely within any combination of (i) the lot on which the tower is to be located, (ii) adjoining property owned by the same person(s), or (iii) property owned by a person or persons who have each consented to the location of the tower by a written, notarized consent form that must be addressed and provided to the Commission. Under no circumstances shall the proposed fall zone encompass any existing buildings intended for human occupancy.
4. Co-Location: An applicant for any proposed new telecommunications tower, with the exception of towers intended solely for amateur radio communications, shall demonstrate that the tower is capable of accommodating both the applicant's proposed antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is 100 feet or more in height or at least one additional user if the tower is 50 feet or more in height.
b. General Criteria for All Telecommunications Facilities
1. Visibility: The applicant shall be required to provide adequate evidence that the visibility of the proposed telecommunications facilities from surrounding areas has been minimized to the extent possible. Such evidence shall include a "viewshed" analysis showing all areas from which the facilities would be visible. The Commission may require the applicant to fly a balloon or to employ another appropriate method to simulate the visibility of the tower or other facilities at the proposed location from other sites within the Town. No lights shall be mounted on any telecommunications towers unless required by state or federal laws or regulations. The color and shape of the tower must be designed to blend with its natural surroundings to the extent possible.
2. Safety: The applicant shall provide adequate evidence that the proposed telecommunications facilities will comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations regarding electromagnetic emissions and aviation safety, and that the facilities will not unreasonably interfere with existing or currently proposed public safety communications.
3. Protection of Natural and Historic Resources: The Commission shall consider the extent to which the proposed telecommunications facility may unreasonably harm or otherwise affect any natural or historic resources, including scenic views, on or near the lot on
84
which the facility has been proposed. The applicant shall demonstrate the extent to which such resources have been considered in formulating the proposal for the facility.
Section 5.09.07 Cessation of Use of Tower
Any telecommunications tower that has not been used for a period of one year must be completely removed from the site unless the owner or operator of the facility submits to the Commission a written statement indicating that the use has not been abandoned and adequately specifying how and when the use will be recommenced. The Commission may require that additional information be submitted to prove any such statement. If the Commission determines that the statement or the information submitted in support of the statement is not credible, it may determine that the use of the tower has been abandoned and may order the immediate removal of the tower.
Section 5.10 Recreational Conveyances and Trailers
Section 5.10.01 Recreational and Utility Conveyances
No recreational vehicle, boat, and/or recreational or utility trailer may be used for sleeping, living, cooking, or for carrying on a business in any district except as may be provided elsewhere in these Regulations.
Section 5.10.02 Trailers
Trailers are permitted in the Town of Coventry only under the following Conditions:
a. No trailer may be used for human habitation or commercial purposes when parked upon a public highway.
b. Trailer occupancy for residential purposes is restricted to temporary living quarters on a lot owned by the occupant while a permanent dwelling is being constructed on the premises or for farm labor purposes, as provided in subsection 5.10.02.d Trailer occupancy for non-residential purposes is restricted to temporary field-office uses. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning Agent to allow the trailer to be used for any such residential or non-residential occupancy. The permit shall be valid for no more than one year, but may be extended for successive periods of six (6) months if construction is on-going at the time of such extension. No such permit may be issued unless and until the Town Sanitarian or Director of Health or his or her authorized agent certifies in writing that the water supply and sewage disposal system (which may be a portable chemical toilet) comply with applicable state and local regulations. The permit shall at all times be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises at which any trailer is operated.
c. With the exception of a trailer that is clearly designed or intended for use as a temporary field office, each trailer shall be considered a temporary dwelling occupying a lot and shall be subject to the same lot area, yard, and setback requirements applicable to dwellings in the zone in which such trailer is located.
d. Farm Labor Quarters: The Zoning Agent may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance to the owner or operator of a farm for occupancy of a trailer by one (1) or more farm laborer(s) employed
85
on the premises. Such Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be valid for three (3) years from the effective date thereof and shall be renewed provided that the property owner meets the following conditions:
1. The farm shall be a bona-fide farming operation, and the owner or operator shall reside in a permanent dwelling on the farm.
2. The trailer shall be occupied only by persons who are employed full-time in farming work on the premises, and by the families of such persons.
3. There shall be not more than one (1) trailer for each twenty (20) acres of land under active cultivation during the period of the Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
4. The number, size, occupancy, and other characteristics of the trailer(s) allowable under this Section shall be such as to constitute an Accessory Use, as that term is defined in these Regulations, to the principal farming use.
5. Housing quarters must meet Public Health and Housing Code criteria as applicable.
Section 5.11 Storage and Display of Goods and Merchandise
If any goods or merchandise are stored or displayed in connection with a nonresidential use, such goods or merchandise shall be stored or displayed behind the established building line, except that a permitted roadside stand may be located behind the established street lines. The foregoing regulation shall be applicable in all zones other than the Village Center Zone and the Gateway Zone.
Section 5.12 Stormwater Management Regulations
Section 5.12.01 Purpose and Applicability
a. The watercourses and water bodies of the Town of Coventry are valuable natural, economic, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic resources. The preservation and protection of these waters is essential to the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the Town. The purpose of this section is, therefore, to protect the water resources of the Town of Coventry from pollution through management of stormwater flows and minimizing the input of suspended solids, pathogens, toxic contaminants, nitrogen and floatable debris as well as thermal impacts to these flows.
b. The provisions of this section shall apply to all development occurring within the Town of Coventry. The requirements of this section shall be deemed to be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed to limit the application of any other provisions of these Regulations.
86
Section 5.12.02 Objectives
a. Stormwater management systems and plans shall be designed and implemented to meet the following objectives:
1. Minimize the increase in stormwater runoff emanating from the subject property through the use of best management practices (BMPs) to prevent down gradient flooding. In approving any application for development of property, the Commission may require that there be no increase in runoff peak flows from the relevant lot for storms of designated frequencies (for example, the 25-year, 50-year, or 100-year storm frequency) if it deems such requirement reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect down gradient properties.

Section 5.13 Designed Apartment/Condominium Developments
Section 5.13.01 Intent
The intent of this section is to provide an opportunity for the construction of a variety of housing types in Coventry to meet varying life styles, family sizes and income levels; to provide for apartment developments which are compatible with the character of the town and existing neighborhoods; to allow apartment developments on those tracts of land which, by reason of topography, favorable soil conditions, adequate road access and neighborhood character, are favorable to accommodating such clusters; and to encourage an aesthetically pleasing complex of multi-family units. Designed Apartment/Condominium Developments may be approved by special permit in the zones specified in Article VI, provided, however, that no such permit shall be issued for any such development in the drainage basin (watershed area) of Coventry Lake (Wangumbaug Lake).
89
Section 5.13.02 Minimum Area, Density, Coverage and Frontage
A minimum of 7.5 contiguous acres on a single lot, having at least 50 feet of frontage on a State highway or a Town road meeting current Town road specifications, shall be required for a designed apartment/condominium development. Each development shall have a maximum density of two (2) dwelling units per acre, except for senior housing which shall have a maximum density of four (4) dwelling units per acre when served by public sewer. No single building shall contain more than four (4) dwelling units. No dwelling unit in senior housing may contain more than three (3) bedrooms. Total land coverage, including all impervious surfaces, shall not exceed twenty-five percent.
Section 5.13.03 Caretaker Unit for Senior Housing
One dwelling unit in a senior housing development may be occupied without regard to the age of the occupants, if that unit is occupied by at least one person serving as maintenance manager or superintendent who is responsible for the maintenance and/or management of the senior housing project.
Section 5.13.04 Application Procedures.
Designed Apartment/Condominium Developments shall be subject to a modified special permit/site plan approval process. The applicant shall submit with the application such fees as may be required for a special permit. The applicant shall also submit such information as is required for a special permit pursuant to Section 7.03, except as provided herein. In lieu of detailed design plans showing specific locations of buildings, structures, drainage and parking facilities and utilities, and open spaces, the applicant may provide a preliminary, conceptual site plan showing the potential, generalized locations of such features. The conceptual site plan shall be designed to assist the Commission in determining the appropriateness of issuing a special permit but shall not be deemed to be the final site plan. If a special permit is granted, the applicant shall file with the Commission within six months a detailed final site plan containing all of the information required by Section 7.02 and 7.03, plus appropriate fees and other data as may be required by the Commission. The final site plan shall substantially comply with the conceptual site plan submitted for the special permit approval. All final site plans shall be prepared, stamped, and signed by a registered and licensed engineer, land surveyor, and/or landscape architect, as appropriate. The Commission shall approve, or approve with modifications and conditions, the final site plan as provided in Section 7.02 and 7.03 of these Regulations. In considering the application for special permit, the Commission shall make specific findings on the following:
a. That the proposed type, design and size of the complex is in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood and existing land uses, with particular emphasis on the potential impact on nearby historic structures and properties.
b. That the proposed site is adequately screened from adjacent streets and properties, thereby providing for a transition from adjacent land uses of a different character. Any site which cannot be adequately screened shall be considered inappropriate for a designed apartment/condominium development.
c. That the applicant has given full consideration to the aesthetic quality of the project, including architectural design, landscaping, and proper use of the lands natural features.
90
d. That the proposal will not hinder nor discourage the appropriate development and use of adjoining lands and buildings.
e. That the proposal incorporates a safe and suitable access, which will not create traffic hazards on existing town roads.
f. That adequate provision has been made for sewage disposal, water supply, fire Protection and storm drainage systems.
Section 5.13.05 Additional Requirements.
a. Underground utilities are required unless specifically waived by the Commission.
b. All access drives shall, where feasible, be a minimum of 50 feet from side property lines and, except as noted below, shall be built to conform to standards for Town roads.

i. The applicant shall dedicate conservation easements to the Town for any areas within 20 feet of any watercourses and for all areas within 50 feet of the front, side and rear lot lines. The Commission may authorize the use of conservation easement areas to permit necessary driveways or emergency access entrances and exits. The Commissions approval of a plan showing driveways or emergency access entrances and exits within the conservation easement areas shall be deemed to constitute approval of such uses in the designated areas.
91
j. To insure and protect the health, welfare and safety of the future residents and to protect the Town of Coventry from any potential obligation to correct health or safety hazards, the Commission may require a bond or other security for all improvements associated with the proposed development to the extent permitted under the Connecticut General Statutes. Such improvements shall include but not be limited to the following: roadway, drainage, public sewer, public water, parking areas, recreation facilities and landscaping. The required security shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the estimated cost of such improvements. The Commission shall set the amount of the security after consulting with the Town Engineer. The security shall be in a form acceptable to the Commission upon the advice of the Town Attorney. The Commission may allow the security to be renewed. The required security shall be reduced or released by the Commission upon completion of an entire system or improvement.
k. The Commission shall require a maintenance bond or other security with respect to any such systems or structures that are to be dedicated or conveyed to the Town for a one-year period after the completion of the improvements. The Commission may partially release any such security upon partial completion of the improvements.
l. The Commission may allow the development to be bonded in stages provided the first stage has a minimum of eight (8) dwelling units and provided that each stage can function as a separate entity.
m. No zoning permit shall be issued on the development until the required security is posted and accepted by the Town Attorney.
n. All outdoor lighting shall be screened from adjoining property.

Section 6.14 Industrial Heritage Overlay (IHO) District (Added  Effective 06/07/07)
Section 6.14.01 General
The Planning and Zoning Commission may establish Industrial Heritage Overlay Districts (IHO) for properties containing former mills aged fifty (50) years of greater, upon the concurrent approval of a Redevelopment Plan in conformance with Section 6.14.04. Zoning regulations applicable to such property as established by the underlying district shall continue in full force and effect unless, and only to the extent, superseded by the IHO.
112
Section 6.14.02 Statement of Purpose
IHO Districts are intended to encourage adaptive re-use of Coventrys historic mills, promote diversified housing opportunities in combination with commercial, retail or office use where such mixed uses are appropriate, and retain historic architecture while adapting obsolete or underutilized structures to 21ST Century needs. Factors to be considered by the Commission in approving the Redevelopment Plan for a proposed IHO District include:
a. The extent to which the Redevelopment Plan would preserve buildings and building elements or designs possessing historic and architectural significance. New buildings and building additions should be architecturally compatible in terms of scale and style with existing historic structures and respect exterior attributes of such structures. The Commission may require the applicant to submit a report by a professional architect.
b. The extent to which the Redevelopment Plan would address Coventrys housing needs and/or provides space for business or retail establishments. Since each historic mill property is unique in terms of its location and design challenges, there shall be no mandatory area ratio of residential use versus commercial use; rather, the type and placement of each proposed use shall be indicated in the Redevelopment Plan.
c. Harmony between mixed uses (e.g., commercial, retail and/or residential) that are proposed for the property; compatibility with neighboring land uses; enhancement of the built, natural and human environment; promotion of pedestrian safety within the site; and provision for adequate parking.
d. Furtherance of goals and objectives contained in Coventrys Plan of Conservation and Development.
Section 6.14.03 Establishment of District
The Commission shall establish an IHO District only upon approval of (i) a Redevelopment Plan and (ii) any regulations (overlay regulations) that will apply to the IHO District and will supersede those of the underlying district. The Redevelopment Plan is not intended to be a substitute for, nor shall it be required to contain, all of the detailed documentation specified in Section 7.02.02, but it should provide sufficient information to determine if the proposal is in conformance with Section 6.14.02. The approval of an IHO District shall constitute a zoning map amendment in accordance with Section 9.02 of these Regulations.
a. Numbering of IHO Districts. Each IHO District shall be numbered and depicted sequentially on the official zoning map in accordance with the date of adoption as IHO-1, IHO-2, and so forth.
b. District Size and Control. No minimum parcel size is required for a rezoning. Adjoining lots may be combined for purposes of a rezoning application, provided that all owners of record shall indicate in writing that they are aware of the application and that the applicant is authorized to act on their behalf under these Regulations.
c. Sunset Provision. Approval of the zone change shall become null and void unless a site plan for the IHO District is approved together with the Redevelopment Plan or is submitted within
113
24 months after the effective date of the approval of the IHO District. The Commission may grant one or more extensions of this period upon written request of the applicant, but in no event will the extensions exceed 24 additional months.
Section 6.14.04 Redevelopment Plan
The purpose of a Redevelopment Plan submission is to determine the extent to which the proposed adaptive re-use would satisfy the goals and objectives set forth in Section 6.14.02 and in the Plan of Conservation and Development. The Redevelopment Plan, once adopted for a particular mill property, shall establish the dimensional characteristics of the specific IHO District and its uses. All graphic elements of the Redevelopment Plan shall be prepared by a licensed engineer, architect, or landscape architect, and shall include:
a. Plan showing existing site conditions and structures, including wetlands, watercourses and floodplain areas, which along with other surveys and plans listed below shall be at a scale in which one inch equals 100 feet.
b. Boundary survey of the proposed IHO District, prepared to Class A-2 accuracy by a Connecticut licensed land surveyor.
c. Plan indicating structures to be retained, substantially rehabilitated, or demolished; new structures to be built on the property; parking areas; vehicular and pedestrian circulation; and areas to be landscaped or dedicated to public use. This plan shall provide sufficient information to determine proposed uses and size of buildings, and the amount of off-street parking to be provided.
d. Preliminary building elevations, including renderings of architectural style and materials.
e. Narrative report describing the proposed Redevelopment Plan, including: (1) the history and architectural significance of all structures on the site, including period, style and method of building construction; (2) the architectural compatibility of any proposed new structures to the existing structures; (3) the cumulative amount of square feet intended for each type of proposed use; (4) the number of proposed residential units including their approximate size and character, and (5) the specific type of proposed residential uses (i.e., market rate, affordable, or age-restricted housing).
f. Narrative report describing the types of hazardous materials that may be encountered during renovations, and the steps that will be taken to isolate and abate such materials.
g. Information on the location, availability and capacity of public utilities capable of serving the development.
Section 6.14.05 Site Plan
In addition to the Redevelopment Plan approval and establishment of an IHO District by the Commission, an application for a site plan must be submitted for approval in accordance with Section 7.02.02. The applicant may submit the site plan concurrently with the Redevelopment Plan or within 24 months after the effective date of approval of the IHO District.
114
Section 6.14.06 Specific Design Standards
The following design standards shall apply to all IHO Districts:
a. Area and Bulk Requirements: Existing historic structures within the IHO District shall be deemed to be conforming in terms of front, side, and rear yard setbacks, maximum height and floor area ratio. The applicants Redevelopment Plan and proposed overlay regulations shall specify the extent to which new buildings and additions to existing buildings shall be permitted to have dimensional standards that are different from those of the underlying district. Any expansion of existing structures shall be consistent with the structures exterior historic architecture.
b. Replacement Structures: Where the applicant demonstrates that one or more existing buildings are inappropriate for use or re-use, based upon their current physical condition, design, materials, style and/or financial feasibility, the Commission may approve the replacement of such buildings by new structures possessing architectural compatibility in terms of scale and style with remaining historic structures located on the property. No Redevelopment Plan shall be approved unless it substantially preserves the historic elements of the affected properties.
c. Parking Residential: Off-street parking shall be provided at a ratio of no less than two (20 spaces per dwelling unit. The Commission shall determine the total residential parking requirement, taking into account opportunities for shared parking and available public parking areas adjacent to the site. Parking required for all non-residential uses shall be governed by these Regulations.
Section 6.14.07 Permitted Uses
Any uses in the Village Residence Zone or Gateway Zone may be allowed, either separately or as mixed uses, in an IHO District.

Site plans need not be based upon an A-2 survey if the proposed activity (i) does not involve the construction or alteration of a principal building, full foundation or frost wall, and (ii) is not located within five (5) feet of any required minimum yard. However, an applicant who does not submit an A-2 survey is acting at his or her own risk; neither the Zoning Agent, the Commission, nor any other Town official shall be responsible for any conditions or circumstances (including the denial of a certificate of zoning compliance or building permit) that may arise as a result of the inaccuracy of any information presented in a zoning site plan.
In cases in which the submission of a site plan is not specifically required by the provisions of these Regulations, but the Zoning Agent determines that the submission of a site plan would be helpful in determining the conformity of an existing or proposed building, structure or use to these Regulations, the Zoning Agent may waive any of the foregoing requirements which he or she deems unnecessary for that purpose.
117
Section 7.02.03 Additional Application Requirements

Section 7.02.04 Waiver of Certain Requirements for Applications
The Commission or its designated agent may waive any of the requirements for a zoning site plan if the applicant requests such a waiver in writing, specifying the subsections proposed to be waived and the reasons for such waiver(s), and the Commission or its designated agent determines that the information is not needed to determine whether the proposed use or structure conforms with the requirements of these Regulations.
Section 7.02.05 Review of Applications by the Zoning Agent
In situations in which these Regulations do not require the approval of a site plan by the Commission, the Zoning Agent shall approve the site plan if the proposed use, as depicted on the site plan, complies with all applicable provisions of these Regulations, or shall deny the site plan if it does not comply. The Zoning Agent may not modify or place conditions on the approval of a site plan. The Zoning Agent shall not employ the standards set forth in Section 7.02.07 in reviewing a site plan; those standards are to be employed solely by the Commission when the regulations require review of a site plan by the Commission.
Section 7.02.06 Review of Applications by the Commission
In situations in which these Regulations require the approval of a site plan by the Commission, the Commission may approve the site plan if the proposed use, as depicted on the site plan, complies with all applicable provisions of these Regulations, or may deny the site plan if it does not comply. In addition, the Commission may modify and approve a proposed site plan if it determines that such modifications would cause the proposed building, use or structure to better comply with the provisions of these Regulations and with the standards set forth in Section 7.02.07, below.
Section 7.02.07 Site Plan Review Standards for Commission Review
In situations in which these Regulations require the approval of a site plan by the Commission, the Commission shall employ the following standards:
1. Preservation of Landscape: Excavation, filling, grading and removal of earth materials and the removal of existing vegetation should be generally limited to the extent necessary to reasonably accommodate the needs of the proposed or existing uses while avoiding substantial and unnecessary changes to the landscape. Where vegetative cover does not exist or has been removed, new plantings may be required. All existing stone walls shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible. In the event that it is required that they be removed, they shall be utilized elsewhere on the property to enhance other stone walls or create new ones to the satisfaction of the Commission. (Revised  Effective 06/15/12)
2. Relation of Buildings to Environment: The design of the proposed project or development shall, to the extent practicable, be related harmoniously to the terrain and to the design and siting of existing buildings in the vicinity of the site. All buildings and other structures shall be sited to protect the character of the neighborhood. The Commission may consider the proper functional, visual, and spatial relationships of all structures, buildings, landscaped elements, and paved areas.
119
3. Buffer Areas: All buffered and/or screened areas, including setback areas (landscaped and usable), shall be so designed as to be consistent and compatible with nearby residential uses and properties.
4. Circulation: With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including entrances, ramps, walkways, drives and parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access points to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, accessibility of emergency vehicles, access to community or public facilities, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and, insofar as practicable, do not detract from the use and enjoyment of proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties.
5. Surface Water Drainage: Special attention shall be given to proper surface drainage so that surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or public storm drainage facilities, will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, and will not create standing water in paved or pedestrian areas. All surface water drained from roofs, streets, parking lots, and other site features shall be disposed of in a safe and efficient manner that will not create problems of water runoff or erosion on the site or on neighboring sites or pollution of surface water or groundwater. Insofar as possible, natural drainage courses and swales shall be properly stabilized and drainage-impounding areas shall be utilized to dispose of water on the site through natural percolation to a degree equivalent to that prior to development. Also, appropriate erosion control measures shall be employed, including slope stabilization measures and the seeding of exposed areas to replace vegetative cover.
6. Preservation of Water Quality and Quantity: The proposed use shall be designed to minimize any risk of surface-water or groundwater pollution, soil erosion and sedimentation, and water diversion.
7. Utilities: The placement of electric, telephone, or other utility lines and equipment shall be underground where possible, so located as to provide no adverse impact on groundwater levels, and coordinated with other utilities.
8. Other Site Features: Exposed storage or utility areas, exposed machinery installations, and service areas shall be designed with screen plantings, fencing, or other screening methods to be compatible with the environment and the surrounding properties.
9. Safety: All open and enclosed spaces shall be designed to facilitate evacuation and to maximize accessibility by fire, police, and other emergency personnel and equipment.
10. Natural and Historical Resources: The site plan shall be designed to minimize any damage or destruction to locally significant natural or historical resources.
Section 7.02.08 Final Site Plan
a. Certification and Filing Requirements.
1. Approval by Zoning Agent: Site plans approved by the Zoning Agent pursuant to these Regulations shall be filed with the Zoning Office. If the building(s), structure(s), use(s) or work for which the site plan was approved is not commenced within two (2) years after the date of approval, the site plan shall become null and void.
120
2. Approval by Commission: Within sixty-five (65) days after the approval of a site plan by the Commission, the applicant shall submit one (1) set of final plans on material suitable for filing in the Towns land records, together with at least three (3) sets on paper, reflecting all conditions or modifications required by the Commission, and accompanied by signed, sworn statements of the applicant's land surveyor, engineer, architect, and any other professional who has participated in the preparation of the application materials, to the effect that the plans submitted are the same as those approved by the Commission except for the depiction of modifications and conditions required by the Commission in its approval vote. The Commission may require the submission of additional sets of plans on paper if needed to provide Commission staff or consultants with an adequate opportunity to review the plans. If, upon considering the statements and reviewing the plans submitted, the Commission shall find the plans to be in accordance with its final approval, the plans shall be endorsed by the signature of the Chairman, or in the absence of the Chairman, by the person then authorized to act in place of the Chairman. In accordance with Section 8-3 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the certification shall state the date on which the approval will expire if all required work is not timely completed. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file one (1) set of endorsed plans in the office of the Town Clerk. No site plan approval by the Commission shall be effective until the final, endorsed plans are filed with the Town Clerk. Any site plan filed in the Town Clerk's Office without the endorsement of the Commission's Chairman or acting Chairman shall be null and void. The Commission, for good cause shown, may extend the time for submission of a final site plan, but not for more than one (1) year after the date of approval. If a final site plan is not filed within the specified time, including any extensions granted by the Commission, the site plan shall expire automatically and become null and void.
b. Substitution of Filing Requirements: If the Commission approves a site plan, the Commission may authorize the filing of the motion for approval, and such other narrative documents as the Commission may require, in lieu of the filing of site plans in the Town Clerks office if the Commission finds either that:
1. All of the following conditions exist: (i) The application does not involve new construction (e.g., buildings, additions, parking, and the like); and (ii) any changes to the site or the exterior, of any existing buildings or structures are cosmetic (e.g., painting, minor landscaping, and the like); and (iii) the application does not involve any excavation, filling, or grading of the site; and (iv) the application does not require the installation of a new septic system or well; or
2. There is already a recorded site plan on file with the Town Clark's Office depicting the site plan information that was required for the subject application.
Section 7.03 Special Permits
Section 7.03.01 Statement of Purpose
The purpose of the special permit regulations is to provide a comprehensive review of the proposed plan for the layout of the building(s), structure(s) or use(s) in relationship to the topographical, geological and other natural features of the land, and of the impact of the use(s) upon the environment, health, safety, welfare, and convenience of the members of the community. It is intended to insure that the design and layout of the site and the proposed use(s) will constitute suitable and appropriate
121
development in character with the neighborhood and will not result in an unreasonable decrease in property values or a detriment to the present and potential use of the area in which it is to be located. Special permit procedures are also intended to assure that proposed buildings, structures and uses will provide for the maintenance of air, surface-water, and groundwater quality and will not be detrimental to existing sources of potable water or other natural or historic resources.
Section 7.03.02 When Required
A special permit must be issued by the Commission before any person may establish or materially change any land use, or use, erect, construct, move, or materially alter or enlarge any building, structure, or use, in whole or in part, if the use, structure, or building resulting from such activity is listed as a use requiring a special permit under Article VI of these Regulations for the zone in which it would be located. For purposes of this section 7.03.02, the term materially enlarge shall be limited to changes that increase the dimensions of any building or structure or the area occupied by the special permit use by twelve (12) inches or more. The Commission shall have the power to determine whether any other change or alteration of a use is material.
Section 7.03.03 Applications
Applications for special permits shall be filed with the Commission on a form provided by the Commission.

The Commission may waive any of the requirements for special permit site plans under Section 7.03.03 of these Regulations if, and only if, the following conditions exist or are met:
a. The proposed activity does not involve the construction, erection, alteration, enlargement, removal or other modification of a principal building or structure; and
b. The proposed activity will not require the use of new wells or new or larger sewage disposal facilities.
The Commission may waive any of the requirements of subsections 7.03.03 (A), (B) and (C) of these Regulations if, and only if, the Commission determines that the requirements sought to be waived are not reasonably necessary to a proper disposition of the application. No waiver under this section shall be granted unless the applicant submits to the Commission, in writing, at the time of and together with the submission of the application, a request for a waiver specifying the requirements the applicant seeks to have waived and the reasons why the applicant believes those requirements should be waived. The Commission shall render a decision on any timely filed request for waiver within 35 days after the day of receipt of the application to which it pertains. If the Commission fails to act on any request for a waiver within such 35 days, the request for waiver shall be deemed to be denied.
Section 7.03.05 Additional Requirements for Applications

Section 7.04 Certificate of Use or Occupancy
No permanent (i.e., unconditional) certificate of use or occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure, or use subject to these Regulations until the Commission or its authorized agent issues a certificate of zoning compliance stating that the building, structure, or use is in conformity with these Regulations and with any required zoning permit, special permit and/or final site plan, or is a valid nonconforming use under these Regulations. Before issuing such permanent certificate, the Commission or its authorized agent shall require an updated "as-built" site plan demonstrating that the building, structure, or use as developed or established fully conforms to the provisions of any zoning permit, special permit, or final site plan. An as-built site plan shall be required for any new single family, two-family or multifamily residential dwelling or structure and shall also be required if the Zoning Enforcement Officer has determined that one is necessary in order to adequately determine compliance with the applicable zoning regulations.

126
Section 7.05 Expiration of Permits and Approvals
A zoning permit or special permit shall expire two (2) years following its issuance if the construction, development, or other activity allowed under such permit has not been actually commenced. A zoning permit or special permit shall expire five (5) years following its issuance if the construction or development allowed thereunder has not been completed. The Commission, upon written request and for good cause shown, may extend either or both of these periods to the extent the Commission deems appropriate. Site preparation alone shall not be deemed to be the actual commencement of the construction, development, or activity under this Section.
A special permit shall also expire (i) upon the abandonment of the building, structure, or use allowed by such special permit, or (ii) if the building or structure has ceased to be used in accordance with such special permit, or (iii) if the use allowed by such special permit has ceased for a continuous period of one year and the owner has not filed with the Commission or its authorized agent a notice of intent to maintain that use.
Section 7.06 Amendment of Permits and Site Plans
Following the issuance of a zoning permit or special permit, no changes or alterations may be made in such permit or in any site plan approved in connection with such permit except by approval of the Commission or its designated agent, whichever provided the original approval, upon written application.
Section 7.06.01 Minor Amendments
If the Commission or its designated agent determines that the requested change or alteration is minor, it, he or she, as appropriate, may issue an amended permit or approve an amended site plan without the need for further procedures under Sections 7.02 or 7.03 of these Regulations. A revised final site plan must be submitted for any change affecting any item shown on the original (previous) site plan. For the purposes of this Section, minor changes or alterations shall include the following activities, unless in the judgment of the Commission or its designated agent, the proposed changes materially affect the character of the site or building or that of adjoining properties: (i) installation of siding overlays on buildings; (ii) introduction, removal or enlargement of doorways and windows within exterior building facades, (iii) whereas-built plans differ from approved preconstruction plans, or (iv) other minor building or site changes.

The time limits set forth in these Regulations for commencing and concluding public hearings, making decisions, and publishing notices of hearings and decisions, are meant to be consistent with requirements of current state law. If the current requirements of state law provide for different time limits on notice requirements than those set forth in these Regulations, the requirements of current state law shall be deemed to apply. The failure of the Commission to comply with any time limit or notice requirement set forth in these Regulations or in current state law shall not be deemed to be an approval of any application, site plan, or permit unless state law requires otherwise.
Section 7.08 Exemptions
The following structures shall not require the issuance of any permit under these Regulations: fences or walls used as fences that are no more than six (6) feet in height; mailboxes; doghouses; childrens playscapes; and flagpoles for display of the flag of the United States of America or the flag of the State of Connecticut.

SECTION 1. TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1. The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures, and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has imperiled and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment, thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement, by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee, to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2. These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Coventry, Connecticut."
1.3. The Inland Wetlands Agency was established as a separate agency of the Town of Coventry pursuant to an enabling ordinance adopted on July 6, 1993.

e. Non-receipt of comments from agencies and commissions listed in subdivisions 10.1.c and d above within the prescribed time shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Agency.
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of the Connecticut Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses;
b. the applicants purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses;
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;

The finding and the reasons therefor shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate, provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision, except that the Agency may consider comments or analysis by its staff or consultants with regard to evidence that is already in the record.
