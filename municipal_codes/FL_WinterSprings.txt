PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Winter Springs of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code, as supplemented through October 12, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The Code has been republished in 2000 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 17 to the 1989 publication, and this republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-1 and 5-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-1.1, 5-1.2 and 5-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(a)  Authority. The rules and procedures established under this article II are adopted in furtherance of subsection 4.13(b) of the City Charter which provides that the city commission shall determine its own rules and order of business. The rules and procedures adopted under this article II are intended to be supplemental and in addition to other applicable provisions of law. To the extent that any provision of these rules and procedures is in conflict with the City Charter, state or federal law, the conflicting provisions of the City Charter, state or federal law shall prevail and apply. The rules and procedures adopted by the city commission shall not be construed or interpreted in any way to limit the broad powers vested in the city commission under the City Charter, article VIII, section 2(b) of the state constitution, the Florida Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, and other applicable law. 
(b)  Agenda packets. The city manager shall have the authority to and be responsible for preparing the city commission agenda for each city commission meeting. The mayor or any city commissioner shall have the right to have a matter placed on the regular agenda for timely consideration and action by the city commission. Upon completion of the agenda packets, the city clerk shall be responsible for distributing agenda packets to the mayor, city commissioners, city manager, city attorney, city staff and the public. Agenda packets shall be made available to the mayor and each commissioner no later than Wednesday (preferably by 5:00 p.m.) prior to the commission meeting; however, when absolutely necessary or in the event of an emergency, the city manager may authorize the distribution of the agenda packets after 5:00 p.m. and may distribute any add-on agenda item(s) after the agenda has been distributed on Wednesday. To the extent that certain agenda items require the review by or distribution of documents to the mayor and city commission that are deemed confidential or exempt from public disclosure by law, the city manager will arrange for such review or distribution in a manner deemed appropriate to protect such exemption or confidentiality. 
(c)  Approval of the agenda. At the commencement of each city commission meeting during the call to order section, the city commission shall approve, by majority vote, the proposed agenda to be considered by the city commission at the meeting. Prior to the approval of the proposed agenda, the city commission may, by majority vote, add or remove agenda items from the proposed agenda or reorder agenda items in terms of placement on the agenda. Upon approval of the agenda, the agenda items will be considered by the city commission in the order presented on the approved agenda.

Motions which have been seconded may be withdrawn by consensus of the city commission without a formal vote. Amendments to pending motions are not required to be accepted by the maker of the pending motion.

(j)  Call the question. Motions to "call the question" shall require a second and a minimum two-thirds (?) vote of the commission.

(l)  Time of adjournment. Unless sooner adjourned by majority vote of the city commission, the mayor shall adjourn the commission meeting at 8:30 p.m. However, by majority vote of the city commission, a commission meeting may be extended beyond 8:30 p.m., but no later than 10:00 p.m., in time increments or to handle any specific agenda item(s). A super-majority vote of the city commission shall be required to similarly extend a commission meeting beyond 10:00 p.m. 
(m)  Reports. At the conclusion of each city commission meeting prior to any additional delegations portion of the city commission meeting, the agenda will set aside a time period for reports subject to the following protocol: 
(1)  During reports, the mayor and each commissioner shall be afforded an opportunity to report on various committees and groups on which they represent the city, and to make brief comments in general.

Further, to the extent that certain information must be distributed by the city manager that is deemed confidential or exempt from public disclosure by law, such information may be distributed directly to the mayor, city commissioners, and city attorney to the extent necessary to protect such exemption or confidentiality. At the meeting, the reporting individual can present or refer to the background information in support of their report item. 
(6)  Reporting individuals may also present their report items in writing to be distributed at the meeting.

(2)  When such person is a city employee who wishes to be heard on a matter relating to his/her employment; or 
(3)  When such person is serving as an authorized representative for a person who would otherwise be permitted to be heard on the subject matter before the city commission. 
(h)  Delegations. Public comment will be included on every city commission agenda under the following conditions: 
(1)  At the beginning of each regular, special or workshop meeting at which the city commission will take final official action on any proposition, the city commission will set aside up to thirty (30) minutes of each regular, special or workshop meeting for "delegations" (aka limited public forum) after call to order and any awards and presentations, immediately prior to taking any final official action on any proposition. In addition, at its discretion, the city commission may set aside up to an additional thirty (30) minutes of each regular, special or workshop meeting for an additional "delegations" portion of the meeting at the end of each city commission meeting. Delegations shall be subject to other applicable provisions of the City Code. The purpose of the first delegations portion of the meeting is for any person to be heard on any item on the agenda, except the following items: 
a.  Emergency items, meaning an official act that must be taken to deal with an emergency situation affecting the public health, welfare, or safety, if compliance with F.S. § 286.0114, would cause an unreasonable delay in the ability of the city commission to act; 
b.  Ministerial items, meaning an official act involving no more than a ministerial act, including, but not limited to, approval of minutes and ceremonial proclamations. Ministerial items also include motions or questions of parliamentary procedure that do not result in a final official action of an item before the city commission; 
c.  Quasi-judicial items, generally meaning land use and other applications considered by the city commission requiring the application of a general rule of existing policy as more specifically described in section 2-30 of the City Code; and 
d.  Public hearing items, where public comments are taken elsewhere on the agenda when the item is presented. 
The purpose is also to allow any resident or taxpayer of the city to make his/her views known to the city commission upon any subject of general or public interest. Additionally, a city employee shall be permitted to address the mayor and city commission as to matters regarding his/her employment, and a user of the city's sewer or water system shall be permitted to address the city commission regarding matters related to the city's sewer and/or water system. 
(2)  The second discretionary "delegations" at the end of the meeting shall be for the limited purpose of allowing any resident or taxpayer of the city to make his/her views known to the city commission upon any subject of general or public interest. Additionally, a city employee shall be permitted to address the mayor and city commission as to matters regarding his/her employment, and a user of the city's sewer or water system shall be permitted to address the city commission regarding matters related to the city's sewer and/or water system. 
(3)  Each person addressing the city commission during delegations shall speak for no more than three (3) minutes and a person representing a group or homeowner's association shall speak for no more than five (5) minutes, unless a lesser or greater time is provided by a majority vote of the city commission. 
(4)  If it appears that a matter presented by a speaker during delegations is administrative in nature, and the question or matter raised can be adequately answered or addressed by the city manager or administrative staff, the city commission may request, upon consensus, or proper motion and majority vote, that the speaker refer the matter to the city manager or his designee during normal city business hours. If such a referral is made by the city commission, the speaker shall have no further right to present that matter at the meeting. If the speaker is not adequately satisfied by the city's administrative staff upon proper referral, the speaker shall have the right to bring the matter in question before the city commission during the delegations portion of any subsequent city commission meeting. 
(5)  The city commission recognizes that delegations is for the purpose of allowing persons to speak on propositions on the agenda in accordance with limitations and requirements set forth in F.S. § 286.0114, as well as for purposes of legitimate inquiries and discussion by the public. Delegations is not for the purpose of advancing arguments or repetitious questions concerning matters which the city commission believes to be closed which are not propositions requiring final official action of the commission or not of general public concern. Further, it is not appropriate to readdress quasi-judicial and public hearing items previously addressed by the city commission at the same meeting. The city commission shall have the right at any delegations to decline to hear any person or any subject matter upon consensus, or proper motion and majority vote, by the city commission in accordance with law. 
(i)  Public hearings in general. The city commission shall hold a public hearing on agenda items to the extent required by law including, but not limited to, items related to the adoption of ordinances, adoption of the annual millage and budget, and other agenda items required by law. The following are intended to be general guidelines for such hearings: 
(1)  All public hearings shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation one (1) time in advance of the public hearing, stating the date, time, place, and nature of the public hearing, and the location where further information may be obtained regarding the subject matters to be considered. Advertisements shall comply with the public notice requirements required by applicable Florida Statutes and law. 
(2)  Proposed ordinances or resolutions and notice shall be placed at city hall for public review in advance of each public hearing. 
(3)  At the public hearing, the city attorney shall read any ordinance or resolution by title or in full, as required by general law or City Charter, for the public record, and provide general background to the item along with city staff. 
(4)  Members of the public speaking on public hearing items, though entitled to be heard by the city commission, are not entitled to an immediate response by either administrative staff members or city commission members once the public hearing is closed; however, commission discussion may or may not include a response. No question by the public should be addressed directly to any member of the administrative staff. 
(5)  Public comment by individual speakers from the audience on public hearing agenda items shall be limited to three (3) minutes. Representatives of recognized groups shall be limited to five (5) minutes; and total comments on a single issue shall be limited to thirty (30) minutes. Applicants shall be limited to ten (10) minutes. The city commission may grant additional time by consensus, or majority vote, of the city commission if the complexity of the relevant issues addressed during the public hearing require additional public debate. The city commission by consensus, or majority vote, also reserves the right to reduce the time limits to speak if the hour of the commission meeting is late or a large number of speakers desire to speak. Only one (1) presentation per person per issue shall be allowed. 
(6)  Speakers shall be limited to speak on the subject matter of the public hearing item. The presentation of repetitious questions or information concerning the public hearing item shall not be permitted. 
(j)  Public comments on propositions not on the agenda. If a proposition is considered by the city commission at a meeting which is not listed on the agenda, and consideration shall constitute final official city commission action, then the mayor will offer the public an opportunity to speak to that item before the decision is made. However, if final official city commission action on the proposition will occur at a subsequent city commission meeting, the mayor will offer the public an opportunity to speak to that item at the meeting at which the city commission takes final official action on the proposition subject to the applicable provisions of the City Code. Under this section, the term "proposition" does not include ministerial, emergency and quasi-judicial matters as those terms are generally defined in subsection (h)(1)c. of this section. 
(k)  Speaker cards. The city clerk will create and maintain a short form, subject to the city commission's approval, for an individual to use in order to inform the city commission of a desire to be heard during delegations and public hearing items; to indicate his or her support, opposition, or neutrality on an agenda item or proposition before the city commission for consideration; and to indicate his or her designation of a representative to speak for him or her or his or her group on an agenda item or proposition before the city commission if he or she so chooses. The form will also contain the individual's contact information for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the commission rules and procedures and following up on matters to the extent the city believes follow-up is necessary. Forms must be completed by the individual at the meeting and submitted to the city clerk, who will provide them to the mayor or the presiding city commissioner for consideration and handling during the meeting. A person submitting a form is not required to speak, but may request on the form that the mayor or the presiding city commissioner briefly note for the record their support or opposition for an agenda item or proposition before the city commission. 
(l)  Appeals; preservation of a record. It shall be the responsibility of any person deciding to appeal any decision made by the city commission with respect to any matter considered to preserve the record including, but not limited to, a verbatim record of the proceedings and testimony and evidence upon which any such appeal is to be based. In the event that such person prepares or has prepared a verbatim transcript of the proceeding by a court reporter, the person shall be required to provide a courtesy copy of the transcript to the city clerk for purposes of maintaining public records and any future appeal. 
(m)  Campaign-free zone. The city commission chamber is hereby declared a campaign-free zone and visible campaign materials and speeches shall be prohibited in the chamber during city commission meetings. Standard size (approximately 2 inches by 4 inches) candidate name badges are permitted and shall not be considered campaigning under this subsection. 
(n)  Placards, signs, posters, flags and banners. Due to the limited size and function of the city commission chambers and city hall lobby, and for the safety and protection of the public attending commission meetings, the public is prohibited from bringing placards, signs, posters, flags and banners for public display within the chamber and lobby during city commission meetings, unless a placard, sign, poster, flag or banner is authorized in advance by the city manager or city commission to be ceremonially presented to the city commission as part of an agenda item. However, in such instances, the placard, sign, poster, flag or banner shall be properly stored and set aside until the ceremonial presentation in order to avoid disrupting the meeting, impeding the public's attendance, or injuring the public in attendance. 
(o)  Enforcement; order of removal. The mayor or the presiding city commissioner shall enforce the rules adopted by the city commission. Any person in violation of any of the rules shall first be given a warning of the violation. Any subsequent violations shall be cause for removal from the chambers by the police chief or his designee for the remainder of the city commission meeting by order of the mayor, the presiding city commissioner or a majority of the city commission. Notwithstanding, the mayor, the presiding city commissioner or a majority of the city commission may order the immediate removal of any person from the city commission chambers that poses a threat to property or life safety. 
(Ord. No. 2016-09, § 2, 10-10-16) 
Sec. 2-29. - Additional rules of conduct. 
    The mayor and city commissioners shall adhere to the following additional rules of conduct: 
(1)  The proper statutory and City Charter role of a mayor and city commissioner, as with any elected member of a legislative body, is to act collectively, not individually, to set and/or revise and/or to apply the city's governing policies and that the city manager and staff administer such policies. 
(2)  The mayor and city commissioners, individually, do not manage the affairs of the city. The mayor and city commissioners will not intrude into daily operations or spheres of responsibility designated by state statutes, City Code, and City Charter to the city manager as the chief executive officer; or undermine the city manager's lawful authority. The city manager is responsible for administering the policy direction established by a majority vote of the city commission and not the policy wishes of the mayor or one (1) individual city commissioner. 
(3)  The mayor and city commissioners represent the interests of the entire city when making decisions and will rely upon available facts and their respective independent judgment. In their official capacity as an elected representative of the city, the mayor and city commissioners will avoid conflicts of interest and avoid using their official position for personal, professional, or partisan gain. 
(4)  The mayor and city commissioners will demonstrate dignity, respect, and courtesy toward those whom they are in contact with in their official capacity as either the mayor or city commissioner. The mayor and city commissioners will refrain from intimidation and ridicule of the mayor, fellow commissioners, city manager, city attorney, staff, citizens of the city, and city utility customers. 
(5)  The mayor and city commissioners, in their official capacity as an elected representative of the city, will refrain from inappropriate language including statements that are malicious, threatening, slanderous, disparaging, mean-spirited, vulgar or abusive. All disagreements, concerns or criticisms shall be framed in language that is in keeping with the dignity and professionalism of an elected official and the honor of serving as an elected representative of the city. 
(6)  The mayor and city commissioners will focus on solving problems, and in doing so will maintain appropriate decorum and professional demeanor in the conduct of city business and work cooperatively and conscientiously with others as they respectively request or receive information, examine data or weigh alternatives in the decision-making process. 
(7)  The mayor and city commissioners will demonstrate patience and refrain from demanding, interruptive access to staff or immediate responses or services when requesting information that requires significant staff time in research, preparation or analysis or that will result in staff neglect of urgent duties. Such requests will be made through the city manager for scheduling and prioritizing through consensus of the city commission. The mayor and city commissioners will work cooperatively with the city manager to establish reasonable parameters for such requests and access. 
(8)  The mayor and city commissioners will devote adequate time for preparation prior to city commission meetings and as much as possible, the mayor and each member of the city commission will be in attendance at such meetings and all other scheduled events where their official participation is required. 
(9)  The mayor and city commissioners will respect diversity and encourage the open expression of divergent ideas and opinions from the mayor and fellow city commissioners, city manager, city attorney, staff, citizens of Winter Springs, and city utility customers. They will listen actively and objectively to others' concerns or constructive criticisms. 
(10)  The mayor and city commissioners will refrain from any individual action that could compromise lawfully authorized decisions of the city or the integrity of the city and the mayor and fellow commissioners. The mayor and city commissioners will delineate clearly for any audience whether they are acting or speaking as an individual citizen or in their respective capacity as a representative of the city. 
(11)  The mayor and city commissioners will maintain in confidence any privileged or confidential information provided to them by the city and will not disclose such information publicly or to any person who has not been duly authorized by the city to receive such information, unless such disclosure is duly authorized by the city commission or city manager or required by law. In addition, the mayor and city commission will refrain from copying any written privileged or confidential documents provided to them by the city and will keep such documents in safekeeping. Further, upon leaving office or upon request by the city commission or city manager, the mayor and city commissioners will return to the city any privileged or confidential documents or materials provided to them by the city while serving on the city commission. For purposes of this paragraph, privileged and confidential information is only information that is deemed privileged or confidential and/or exempt from public records disclosure by law. By way of example, and without limiting the scope of the kinds of information that could be privileged or confidential and/or exempt, the following information is generally deemed privileged or confidential and/or exempt from public disclosure: (i) information pertaining to security systems for any property owned or leased by the city; (ii) risk assessment information to determine security threats to data, information and information technology resources of the city; (iii) attorney-client work product related to pending or reasonably anticipated litigation or city claims file; (iv) city commission transcripts of attorney-client litigation sessions until the conclusion of litigation; (v) claims files regarding the city's risk management program (vi) information concerning the plans, intentions, or interests of a private entity to located, relocate or expand its business activities within the city if the private entity requests such confidentiality in writing; (vii) all work product developed by the city in preparation for collective bargaining negotiations, and during negotiations; (viii) trade secrets and proprietary business information contained in records held by the city; (ix) certain personal identifying and health information contained in records held by the city when required by law; (x) active criminal intelligence information and active criminal investigative information; and (xi) any information revealing law enforcement surveillance techniques or procedures or personnel or information revealing the identity of a confidential informant or confidential source. The mayor and city commissioners may contact the city manager or city attorney with any questions on whether certain information falls within the scope of this paragraph. 
(12)  The mayor and city commissioners will abide by all laws of the state applicable to their official conduct on the city commission, including but not limited to the Government in the Sunshine Law, the Florida Public Records Law, the Florida Code of Ethics for Public Officers, and city rules and procedures and codes of conduct adopted by the city commission including, but not limited to, the rules and procedures and code of conduct expressed in this article. 
(13)  The mayor and city commissioners will promote constructive relations in a positive climate with all city employees, city attorney, and city contractors and consultants consistent with their official role on the city commission, as a means to enhance the productivity and morale of the city. The mayor and city commissioners will support the city manager's decision to employ the most qualified persons for staff positions. The mayor and city commission will recognize the bona fide achievements of the city manager, staff, city attorney, city contractors and consultants, business partners, and others sharing in, and striving to achieve, the city's mission and strategic objectives. 
(14)  The mayor and city commissioners will enhance their knowledge and ability to contribute value to the city as a member of the city commission by keeping abreast of issues and trends that could affect the city through reading, continuing education and training. The mayor and city commissioners will study policies and issues affecting the city, and will attend training programs if required by the city or law. A continuing goal of the mayor and city commissioners will be to improve their respective performance as a member of the city commission. 
(15)  The mayor and city commissioners will value and assist each other on the city commission by exchanging ideas, concerns, and knowledge through lawful means of communication. Together, they will help build positive community support for the city's mission and the policies and strategic objectives established by the city commission. 
(16)  The mayor and city commissioners will support and advocate for their respective beliefs, but will remain open to understanding the views of others. The mayor and city commissioners recognize that they each share in the responsibility for all city decisions and will accept the will of duly authorized decisions of the city commission and city electorate. 
(17)  The mayor and city commissioners understand that their first priority as a member of the city commission will always be to look out for the best interests of the citizens of the city and the public health, safety and welfare. The mayor and city commissioners will seek to provide appropriate leadership that nurtures and motivates city citizens to be stakeholders in the affairs and achievements of the city. 
(18)  The mayor and city commissioners will be accountable to the city commission for any violations of the rules and procedures and rules of conduct established by the city commission under this article. 
(Ord. No. 2016-09, § 2, 10-10-16) 
Sec. 2-30. - Quasi-judicial rules and procedures of the city commission. 
    The city commission recognizes that certain agenda items presented to the city commission for a final decision are considered by the courts as quasi-judicial in nature. Under applicable law, quasi-judicial proceedings require the mayor and city commissioners to serve as a quasi-judicial decision maker. The city commission must afford due process and comply with due process requirements including, but not limited to, notice, a hearing before an impartial decision-maker, and a right to a fair and orderly hearing process where applicants and interested parties are afforded an opportunity to be heard and present evidence. The following rules and procedures are not intended to be strictly applied, but rather are intended to serve as a guide to assist the mayor and city commission with conducting a quasi-judicial hearing in accordance with the requirements of law: 
(1)  Categories of decisions-quasi-judicial defined generally. For purposes of understanding the context of this section, the city commission will make a variety of different types of decisions that the law classifies differently. For example, some decisions are classified legislative, executive/administrative, or quasi-judicial in nature. The decision making process employed by the city commission and scope of judicial review are markedly different for the different classifications. Quasi-judicial matters are agenda items that generally require the city commission to apply a general rule of existing policy. Such agenda items include, but are not limited to, land use and other applications such as rezonings, variances, special exceptions, conditional uses, special permits, site and engineering plans, and subdivisions of land and plats. 
(2)  Legislative and executive/administrative decisions-Generally. This section is not intended to be applicable when the city commission is exercising legislative and executive/administrative decision making authority. For example, and without the intention of being a limitation on such decisions, the Florida Supreme Court has held that comprehensive plan amendments are considered a formulation of policy and therefore, are considered legislative actions and not quasi-judicial in nature. The adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the city commission that formulates policy is also considered a legislative action. The approval of contracts, appointing of board members and the purchasing of good and services are executive/administrative decisions. 
(3)  Fundamental requirements. Quasi-judicial proceedings shall comply with the minimum requirements of law. Interested parties shall at a minimum be permitted to be heard, present evidence, be represented by counsel, and cross examine witnesses. Decisions made by the city commission will be based on competent substantial evidence presented on the record at the hearing and based upon the application of applicable criteria established by law. 
(4)  Competent substantial evidence. Competent substantial evidence has been generally defined by the courts as such evidence as will establish a substantial basis of fact from which the fact at issue can be reasonably inferred. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. 
(5)  Burden of proof. The applicant seeking approval of an application has the burden of proving that the proposed application is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and complies with all of the applicable substantive criteria and procedural requirements of the City Code and other applicable provisions of law. 
(6)  Objectors; party intervenor applications. 
a.  Persons objecting to an application must prove standing, which is the cornerstone of their right to present any case against an application. Standing is subject to applicable statutory and case law. Typically, but not in every case, the person seeking to prevent or overturn a quasi-judicial decision must show special damages and an interest different in kind and degree from that of the general public's at large. The city commission reserves the right to contest any person's standing to participate in a quasi-judicial hearing at any time through all appellate proceedings even if the person was permitted to participate in the hearing. 
b.  An affected party who believes that they have legal standing and can demonstrate that they have a special interest and may suffer special damages different in kind and degree from that of the general public's at large, can file a party intervenor application with the city manager requesting to be formally declared a party intervenor for purposes of presenting factual and expert testimony and evidence at the quasi-judicial hearing. The application shall be filed at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled quasi-judicial hearing and shall state with specificity the factual and legal basis on which the party believes they have legal standing, and a general list of witnesses and evidence that the party anticipates submitting to the city commission. Failure to timely file a party intervenor application shall be deemed a waiver of the opportunity to seek a party intervenor determination by the city commission. Applications timely filed will be reviewed for legal sufficiency by the city attorney and presented to the city commission at the commencement of the hearing for a determination. The city commission may limit the number of party intervenors or consolidate party intervenors for presentation purposes to avoid unnecessary repetition and delay of the quasi-judicial hearing. If the city commission grants party intervenor status to a party, the party will be afforded time at the hearing to present the factual and expert testimony and evidence in accordance with subsection (8) of this section. Party intervenors may be sworn-in as witnesses and shall be subject to cross-examination by other parties or party intervenors, and shall be required to qualify expert witnesses, as appropriate. 
(7)  Rules of evidence. The strict rules of evidence shall not apply. However, the city commission is required to make decisions on quasi-judicial agenda items based on testimony and evidence that is actually presented on the record at the hearing. The following evidentiary rules should be considered when the city commission receives testimony and evidence at the hearing: 
a.  Lay testimony. Citizen testimony is permissible and may constitute competent substantial evidence so long as it is fact-based. Mere generalized statements of opposition are to be disregarded. The polling of citizens to determine who is "for" or "against" an agenda item is not competent substantial evidence and should not be permitted at the hearing. 
b.  Records, maps and reports. Maps, diagrams, reports and other official records may be competent substantial evidence in themselves including, but not limited to, all official records of the city and any other local, state, federal government agencies. 
c.  Expert testimony. The opinions and recommendations of professional city staff members including, but not limited to, city planning and zoning staff, the city engineer, law enforcement and fire personnel, and other qualified staff members may constitute competent substantial evidence, provided such opinions and recommendations are related to the city staff person's professional expertise and qualifications. The opinions of other duly qualified professionals and experts of applicants and objectors may also be similarly considered competent substantial evidence. 
d.  Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence may be admissible provided it is used to support other competent substantial evidence presented in the record before the city commission. 
(8)  Presentation of evidence. Unless otherwise required by the city commission or as permissible in subsection (8)m. below, the following order of presentation will generally occur on agenda items that are subject to a quasi-judicial hearing: 
a.  The mayor will briefly introduce the item (approximately three (3) minutes). 
b.  The city attorney shall read any ordinance considered by title or in full pursuant to the requirements of the City Charter for the public record, present party intervenor applications timely received for the city commission's determination, and provide general background to the agenda item to the extent necessary (approximately five (5) minutes). 
c.  The city administrative staff and any staff consultants shall present a summary of the application and agenda item and its findings, opinions or recommendation on that application (approximately ten (10) minutes). 
d.  The applicant and any factual and expert witness(es) will provide testimony and evidence on the application and matter being considered (maximum fifteen (15) minutes). 
e.  Any party intervenors and any factual and expert witness(es) will provide testimony and evidence on the application and matter being considered (maximum of ten (10) minutes). 
f.  To the extent that the item is a public hearing, the mayor shall open the public hearing and invite any person in attendance to speak to the issue and to present any factual or expert testimony (if any) relevant to the matter being considered (maximum three (3) minutes per person or five (5) minutes per representative of recognized groups). If the matter is not a public hearing item, objectors (not granted party-intervenor status), proponents and the general public will be permitted to speak to the issue and to present any factual or expert testimony relevant to the matter being considered (maximum three (3) minutes per person or five (5) minutes per representative of recognized groups). 
g.  Cross-examination of adverse witnesses by the applicant and any party intervenors shall be permitted during testimony to the extent requested and necessary in furtherance of due process requirements (maximum five (5) minutes per witness). 
h.  At the close of the evidentiary presentation, the applicant and staff will be afforded the opportunity to rebut any testimony and evidence. (maximum five (5) minutes each). 
i.  At the conclusion of the rebuttal, the mayor shall close the evidentiary portion of the hearing and the city commission shall deliberate and make a final decision on the agenda item. To the extent deemed necessary by the city commission, at its discretion, the city commission may reopen the evidentiary portion of the hearing if the mayor and city commissioners have additional evidentiary inquiries of the applicant, staff or any party intervenor. 
j.  Any documentation presented to the city commission in support of or in opposition to an application and agenda item shall be offered into the record at the hearing by submitting a copy or copies of same to the city clerk. The city clerk shall keep one (1) copy of the documents as part of the record of the proceeding. It shall be the responsibility of the party offering the evidence to make sure that it is received by the city clerk as part of the record, and that extra copies be presented to the mayor and city commissioners as deemed necessary or requested by the city commission. 
k.  The agenda item and any staff report presented on any application and all applicable city codes and ordinances and state and federal law shall be deemed part of the record in all applications considered by the city commission. 
l.  If an applicant, party intervenor, or objector anticipates presenting, for the hearing record, a detailed written report as evidence, the applicant, party intervenor, or objector may submit the report to the city clerk in advance of the hearing and the report will be distributed to the mayor, city commission, city staff and any other interested person requesting the same prior to hearing to the extent feasible so the mayor and city commission and interested persons may examine the report prior to the hearing. Applicants, party intervenors, and objectors shall not submit such reports or any other evidentiary information directly to the mayor and city commission prior to the hearing. 
m.  The city commission recognizes that in limited cases a full-blown quasi-judicial hearing may not be needed in order to ensure due process is satisfied before the city commission takes final action on an application. Such limited cases may occur when: (i) a specific application does not require a public hearing; (ii) the application is deemed complete and supported by a city staff recommendation in favor of approval in accordance with applicable requirements; (iii) the applicant concurs with the city staff recommendation; and (iv) no party intervenor or interested party has appeared at the city commission meeting to contest or seriously question the application and the recommendation and competent substantial evidence contained in the city staff recommendation. In such cases, the city commission may dispense with the evidentiary presentation formalities set forth in this subsection (h), consider the matter informally at its discretion, and rely on the city staff recommendation as uncontested and unrebutted competent substantial evidence, and take final action in a manner deemed appropriate by the city commission to conduct orderly and efficient city business. 
n.  The city commission may modify the time limits specified in this subsection (8) on its own motion or consensus or upon request of a party to the proceeding. A request for a modification of time should be considered by the city commission to assure all parties have an opportunity to participate without undue repetition and delay in furtherance of affording due process. 
(9)  Swearing-in of witnesses. Persons presenting evidence and expert testimony may be required to take an oath and be sworn by the city attorney, collectively or individually, in substantially the following manner: 
I (state witness name) swear or affirm to tell the truth, the full truth, and nothing but the truth. 
(10)  Impartial decision maker; voting conflicts. The mayor and city commissioners sitting in a quasi-judicial capacity will each endeavor to act in an impartial and unbiased manner when it considers quasi-judicial agenda items. The city commission will base its final decision on such agenda items based upon the weight and credibility of competent substantial evidence, both direct and circumstantial, that is presented in the record at the quasi-judicial proceeding before the city commission. The mayor and city commissioners are each permitted to make deductions and reach conclusions which reason and common sense lead them to make in furtherance of legitimate government purposes that are in the city's best interests. Decisions of the city commission are made as a collective body, by majority vote, on a case-by-case basis. The mayor and city commissioners are not expected to testify at the proceeding and are not expected to engage in independent fact finding outside of the proceeding. The city commission may consider the advice of the city manager, city staff and city attorney in their respective official capacities. To the extent that the mayor or any city commissioner believes that they have a voting conflict of interest on any agenda item, under F.S. § 112.3143, or other applicable law, the mayor or city commissioner with the conflict shall declare a voting conflict and recuse themselves from participating in the proceeding, abstain from voting upon the agenda item, and file the applicable voting conflict form. In addition, pursuant to F.S. § 286.012, the mayor or any city commissioner may abstain from voting on a quasi-judicial agenda item if the abstention is to assure a fair proceeding free from potential bias or prejudice. 
(11)  Ex parte communications. The mayor and city commissioners will neither knowingly initiate nor consider ex parte communications not disclosed on the record concerning the merits of any quasi-judicial application that is currently pending before the city commission or that the mayor or city commissioners knows or reasonably expects will be filed with the city commission within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of any such communication. To the extent feasible and practicable, the mayor or city commissioners should avoid ex parte communications concerning the merits of any such application. Applicants, party intervenors, and any other non-city staff persons desiring to discuss the merits of such Applications or to provide written documents that would be considered ex parte communications should be directed to contact the city manager or his or her designee responsible for processing the application. The city manager or his or her designee will be responsible for handling the discussion or written communication in a manner deemed appropriate. The city manager or his or designee will be responsible for scheduling and conducting all meetings, and handling all official communications between the city (and its officials and employees) and applicants and party intervenors. 
a.  Pursuant to F.S. § 286.0115, if the mayor or any city commissioner receives ex parte communications regarding any application, the mayor or any city commissioner must publicly disclose such communications before or during the hearing at which a vote is taken on the quasi-judicial matter, so that persons who have opinions contrary to those expressed in the ex parte communications are given a reasonable opportunity to refute or respond to the communications. Specifically, all written communications received and all written responses to such communications will be placed on the record at the hearing, and the substance of all oral communications received and all oral responses made will be placed on the record. 
b.  This subsection (11) is not intended to prohibit the mayor and city commissioners from making official inquiries of, or obtaining advice from, the city manager, city staff and city attorney in their respective official capacities. 
c.  This subsection (11) is not intended to preclude the mayor and city commissioners from communicating with constituents and members of the public regarding the general existence or status of any application nor preclude the mayor or any city commissioner from attending community or homeowner's association meetings which are generally open to city residents and constituents at which an application may be discussed. In such circumstances, the mayor and city commissioners will neither knowingly initiate nor participate in ex parte communications regarding the merits of any application. 
(12)  Continuance of hearings. By majority vote of the city commission, the city commission may continue a quasi-judicial hearing on its own initiative or the request of city staff, the applicant or any interested party with standing in order to allow additional time to gather additional relevant evidence to be presented to the commission at a subsequent meeting. 
(13)  Written orders of final decisions. Final decisions made by the city commission regarding quasi-judicial applications and agenda items shall be made verbally by motion and roll call majority vote, but in some cases shall also be memorialized in a separate writing as follows: 
a.  Pursuant to F.S. § 166.033, when the city commission denies an application for a development permit, as that term is defined in F.S. § 163.3164, city staff is directed to prepare and send written notice to the applicant based on the city commission's decision. The notice must include a citation to the applicable portions of an ordinance, rule, statute, or other legal authority on which the city commission based the denial of the permit, which may be contained in the agenda item presented by city staff. "Development permit" includes any building permit, zoning permit, subdivision approval, rezoning, certification, special exception, variance, or any other official action of local government having the effect of permitting the development of land; or 
b.  By majority vote of the city commission, the city commission may direct the city attorney to prepare a proposed order, which will include findings of fact and conclusions of law, for the commission to consider as final commission official action on a quasi-judicial matter. If such direction is given to the city attorney, the hearing will be continued to another city commission meeting at which the commission will consider adopting the proposed order as presented or modified by commission. A copy of the final order will be provided to the applicant and other interested parties upon request; or 
c.  Pursuant to other requirements of law; or 
d.  If notice is not required by subsections a., b. or c. above, city staff may provide a courtesy notice to the applicant of the city commission's final decision. 
(14)  Supplemental quasi-judicial rules. To the extent necessary, the city commission may adopt or employ at a particular hearing supplemental quasi-judicial rules of procedure which shall apply to quasi-judicial matters consistent with the requirements of law. 
(15)  Advisory hearing officer. The city commission may, at its discretion, appoint an independent, advisory hearing officer to conduct a quasi-judicial hearing under this section for purposes of recommending a written order regarding any application. The written order will contain recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing officer shall be a member of the Florida Bar in good standing for five (5) or more years, and must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of municipal law and quasi-judicial proceedings.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-22, §§ 2(Exh. A), 3, adopted Oct. 26, 2015, repealed former Subdiv. A, §§ 2-56-2-65, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Subdiv. A pertained to the code board and derived from the Code of 1974, §§ 2-51-2-57, 2-59; Ord. No. 2002-28, § 2, 9-23-02; Ord. No. 2005-26, § 2, 9-12-05; Ord. No. 2010-14, § 2, 5-24-10. 

Sec. 2-56. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this subdivision to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Winter Springs, Florida, by authorizing the creation of a code enforcement board and designation of special magistrates with the authority to impose administrative fines and other noncriminal penalties to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective, and inexpensive method of enforcing the codes and ordinances of the city where a pending or repeated violation continues to exist. The code enforcement board and designated special magistrates shall have the same status under Chapter 162, Part 1, Florida Statutes, and this subdivision. This subdivision is intended to be supplemental and additional authority and not intended to prevent or prohibit the City from enforcing or obtaining compliance with City Codes by any other lawful means. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-57. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City Manager means the city manager or the acting city manager in the city manager's absence or the city manager's designee, who shall be required to be so designated by the city manager in writing. 
    Code means collectively the City of Winter Springs Code of Ordinances and any statute, code, rule, ordinance, or regulation incorporated into the Code by reference.

A repeat violation can occur only after correction of the previous violation has been made. 
    Special magistrate means an individual designated and determined to be qualified by the city commission pursuant to Section 2-58 of this subdivision. 
    Uncorrectable violation means a violation which is irreparable or irreversible in nature and which cannot be remedied after the violation has been committed because the violation constitutes a single prohibited act rather than an ongoing condition or circumstance. 
    Violator means that person or entity responsible for a violation of the Code (the property owner, tenant, or business entity on the premises, or any combination thereof) and may include the property owner on whose property the violation occurs regardless of who commits the violation. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-58. - Code enforcement board and special magistrates. 
(a)  Code enforcement board. 
(1)  The code enforcement board shall consist of seven (7) members to be appointed by the city commission to seats numbered one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), six (6) and seven (7) in accordance with section 2-41 of the City Code.

Members shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be authorized by the city commission or otherwise as provided by law. 
(3)  The members of the code enforcement board shall serve in accordance with the City Code and may be suspended and removed for cause as provided in section 2-41 of the City Code. In addition, if any member fails to attend two of three successive meetings without cause and without prior approval of the chair, the code enforcement board shall declare the member's office vacant and refer the vacancy to the city commission who shall promptly fill the vacancy. 
(4)  Unless a code enforcement case has been assigned to a special magistrate in accordance with section 2-58(b)(5), or subject to a civil citation pursuant to subdivision B of this division 2, or otherwise being prosecuted by the city pursuant to some other lawful means, code enforcement officers shall notice code enforcement cases before the code enforcement board. 
(5)  Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the city attorney's office shall serve as counsel to the code enforcement board.

Special magistrates may be suspended and removed with or without cause by the commission. Appointments to fill any vacancy shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
(3)  Special magistrates shall be members of the Florida Bar in good standing for five (5) or more years.

(5)  Special magistrates shall handle code enforcement cases expressly required by the City Code, or cases noticed for hearing by a code enforcement officer, provided the city manager has authorized the code enforcement officer to notice a particular case before a special magistrate. 
(c)  Jurisdiction. Once jurisdiction of the code enforcement board system or special magistrate system is invoked for a particular code enforcement violation, jurisdiction regarding the violation shall remain with the system invoked until the violation has been finally adjudicated. Jurisdiction shall be determined by delivery of a notice of violation to the violator which identifies whether the violation will proceed to a hearing under the code enforcement board system or a special magistrate system. It is the intent and purpose of this subsection to prohibit a particular code enforcement violation from proceeding under two different code enforcement systems. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-59. - Powers of code enforcement board and special magistrates.

Sec. 2-60. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  Code enforcement officers shall have the authority to initiate code enforcement proceedings as provided in this subdivision. The code enforcement board and special magistrates shall not have such authority. 
(b)  Except as provided herein, a code enforcement officer who finds a violation of the Code shall issue a notice to the violator stating that the violator has committed a violation of the Code. The notice shall specify a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. This determination shall be based on considerations of fairness; practicability; ease of correction; ability to correct; severity of violation; nature, extent and probability of danger or damage to the public; and other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period prescribed. 
(c)  If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement officer finds that the violator has not corrected the violation within the time period specified in the notice, the code enforcement officer shall notify the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, and request a hearing. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer, the case may be presented to the special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(d)  If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall issue a notice to the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, and request a hearing. The case may be presented to the code enforcement board or special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement board or special magistrate retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. 
(e)  If a code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is an uncorrectable violation, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately request a hearing. 
(f)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the code enforcement board or special magistrate transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable Code provision and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within 5 days after the date of the transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(g)  Nothing herein shall prohibit a violator's from waiving his or her rights to the hearing required by this section and entering into a pre-hearing code enforcement settlement agreement, which must be memorialized in writing and executed by the violator and city manager. Such agreements may include terms and conditions to bring the violation into compliance, impose and require payment of an agreed upon penalty and reimbursement of costs incurred by the city related to the violation, and other terms and conditions deemed necessary to settle the violation. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-61. - Service of notice. 
(a)  All notices required in this subdivision shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or law enforcement officer of the city, code enforcement officer, or other person designated by the city commission; or by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice. In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a), at the option of the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, or the code enforcement officer, notice may also be served by publication or posting as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks, with four (4) publications being sufficient, in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

(2)  Proof of publication shall be made as provided in §§ 50.041 and 50.051, Florida Statutes. 
(3)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (1) above, such notice may be posted for at least ten days in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(4)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a). 
(c)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in Subsection (a) together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirement, of this part has been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged Violator actually received the notice. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15)

(c)  The applicant shall submit, at the time of application, payment to the city in the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its costs associated with recording the order imposing a penalty or fine and the requested reduction or release of lien. These costs are nonrefundable, without regard for the final disposition of the application. 
(d)  Upon receipt of the application for reduction or release of lien and payment provided above, the city manager or designee shall confirm through the code enforcement department that the violation which resulted in the order imposing penalty or fine has been brought into compliance. If the violation has been brought into compliance and there is no current code violation upon the property in question, the city manager shall review and consider the application. Additional information shall also be required to support the application if the city manager deems such information is relevant and necessary to make a final decision on the application. The city commission hereby delegates to the city manager the authority to review and consider applications for release or reduction of liens and make determinations as provided herein. 
(e)  The city manager shall review and consider the following factors in making a determination to reduce or release the lien: 
(1)  The amount of any administrative and out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city which are directly associated with the underlying code enforcement case and lien including, but not limited to, code enforcement staff and attorney time, postage, advertising and recording costs, and other city expenses related to any measure taken by the code enforcement board or special magistrate or city to abate a nuisance caused by the violation;

(8)  The accrued amount of the code enforcement fine or lien as compared to the current market value of the property; 
(9)  With respect to a speculator, non-homestead purchaser of the subject property, the accrued amount of the code enforcement fine or lien as compared to the investment/profit that will be gained as a result of the purchase or sale of the property and the reduction or satisfaction; 
(10)  Any previous or subsequent code violations pertaining to the property unless an order finding a violation is under appeal at the time of determination; 
(11)  Any previous or subsequent code violations of the applicant pertaining to other properties owned within the city, unless an order finding a violation is under appeal at the time of determination; 
(12)  Any relevant information contained in any title policy required to be submitted to the city under this section; 
(13)  Any financial hardship; 
(14)  Any other mitigating circumstance which may warrant the reduction or satisfaction of the penalty or fine; and

(f)  The city manager may, in writing, approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application to reduce or release of lien. To the maximum extent feasible, the city manager shall collect, at a minimum, all administrative and out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city as specified in subsection (e)(1). If the city manager approves the application and the approval is conditioned upon the applicant paying a reduced penalty, fine, or any other condition, the satisfaction or release of lien shall not be prepared or recorded until the condition(s) placed by the city manager have been satisfied. 
(g)  The applicant shall have thirty (30) days in which to comply with the conditions imposed by the city manager or submit a written appeal as provided herein. Failure of the applicant to comply or timely appeal will result in the automatic denial of the application and the original amount of the fine, including costs, shall be automatically reinstated. After the appeal time period has run or is waived by the applicant, in writing, the city manager may, for good cause shown, grant additional time in the form of a written estoppel letter to a closing agent for purposes of facilitating a pending closing of the subject property. 
(h)  If the application is denied, or if the application is automatically denied due to the failure of the applicant to comply with the conditions imposed by the city manager or timely appeal, the applicant shall thereafter be barred from applying for a subsequent reduction or release of lien for a period of one year from the date of denial. During the one-year period, the lien may only be satisfied and released upon full payment of the fine or penalty imposed in accordance with this division. 
(i)  The applicant may appeal the city manager's decision to the city commission, by filing a written appeal within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision with the city clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the decision that is being appealed, the grounds for appeal, and a brief summary of the relief being sought. A nonrefundable filing fee of $100.00 shall accompany the notice of appeal. Upon submittal of a timely appeal and filing fee, the city manager shall place the appeal of the determination upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled city commission meeting to the extent practicable. The city commission shall render a final decision on the application based upon the sworn application and determination of the city manager and any other relevant information or testimony provided to the city commission at the meeting by the applicant, city manager or any other interested party. Any decision made by the city commission pursuant to this section shall be deemed final and not subject to any further administrative review by the city. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days in which to comply with any decision of or condition imposed by the city commission or the application shall be deemed automatically denied and thereafter, the applicant shall be barred from applying for a subsequent reduction or release of lien for a period of one year from the date of the city commission's decision.

(j)  When a lien is satisfied as a result of reduced payment or release as ordered by the city manager or city commission, the city manager is hereby authorized to execute and record in the public records of Seminole County, Florida, a satisfaction of lien on behalf of the city. 
(k)  Under appropriate circumstances determined by the city manager or city commission to be in the best interests of the city, the city manager or city commission may approve an application conditioned upon a partial release of lien that releases a city lien from a specific piece of property. However, the lien will remain in effect and will encumber any other properties which are subject to the lien pursuant to law. Partial releases of lien may also be authorized by the city manager or city commission to account for any funds paid to the city to reduce the amount owned on the lien. In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit the city manager from releasing a lien, in whole or part, which was recorded in error by the city or foreclosed by a superior lien or mortgage in a judicial proceeding. The city manager may impose an administrative charge to release a lien recorded in error or foreclosed to recover the city's costs associated with the subject lien. An application shall not be required to release a lien recorded in error. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21, § 2, 10-12-15) 
Sec. 2-62. - Scheduling and conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon request of the code enforcement officer, or at such other times as may be necessary, the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, may call a hearing. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings, and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The city manager shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required to conduct the hearing. The city clerk shall serve as clerk to the code enforcement board or special magistrate as it serves as clerk to the city commission unless the city manager determines otherwise. 
(b)  The code enforcement officer shall send a notice of hearing in the same manner of service as outlined in section 2-61. 
(c)  The code enforcement officer shall call hearings on a monthly or as needed basis or upon the request of the code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable. Except as provided herein, a hearing date shall not be postponed or continued unless a request for a continuance, showing good cause for a continuance, is received in writing by the code enforcement board or special magistrate at least five (5) calendar days prior to the date set for hearing. 
(d)  A code enforcement board or special magistrate shall postpone a hearing if the named violator, prior to the scheduled hearing date, files with the duly authorized city board or official of appropriate jurisdiction, if any, an administrative appeal concerning the interpretation or application of the Code provisions upon which the alleged violation was based. However, once an issue has been determined by a code enforcement board or special magistrate in a specific case, that issue may not be further reviewed by a city board or official in that specific case. 
(e)  Each case before a code enforcement board or special magistrate shall be presented by a code enforcement officer or by a duly authorized representative of the city. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the code enforcement board or special magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the code enforcement board or special magistrate and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under Section 2-63. 
(f)  A code enforcement board or special magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The code enforcement board or special magistrate shall take testimony from the code enforcement officer and alleged violator, as well as any relevant witnesses, relevant written evidence and documentation may also be submitted into the record. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. The code enforcement board or special magistrate may exercise reasonable discretion in managing the hearing agenda and may continue or reschedule cases to the extent reasonably necessary to afford due process, address continuances for good cause shown, or effectively manage the case load. 
(g)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein and in Chapter 162, Part I, Florida Statutes. The order shall be announced orally at the hearing and shall be reduced to writing and mailed by regular U.S. mail to the alleged violator. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in section 2-63, the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is entered by the code enforcement board or special magistrate pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance and if the original order was recorded in the public records, the order acknowledging compliance shall likewise be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance with the original order. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-63. - Administrative fines; costs of repairs; and filing of liens. 
(a)  The code enforcement board or special magistrate, as applicable, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of the special magistrate or code enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, shall conduct a "Massey" compliance hearing after notice of the hearing is provided to the violator by the code enforcement officer. At the compliance hearing, the violator will be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether the violator is in compliance with the special magistrate's order, and upon a determination of non-compliance, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the order for compliance. In addition, if, pursuant to a finding by the code enforcement board or special magistrate, the violation is a violation described in Section 2-60(e), the city may, at its discretion, make all reasonable repairs that are required to bring the property into compliance and charge against the violator the cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. An accounting of the cost of repairs will be presented to the special magistrate for consideration in such cases. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation, and, shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). The fine for an uncorrectable violation shall not exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall consider the following factors; 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  A code enforcement board or special magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section before an order imposing a fine is recorded in the public records. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of the county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, the order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city commission and the city manager may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section in accordance with the authority granted to the city manager under section 2-63.1. 
(f)  After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus any accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this Section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the State Constitution. 
(Ord. No. 2015-22, § 3, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 2-64. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided under the Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act shall continue for a period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien.

ARTICLE VIII. - JOBS GROWTH INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM 

Sec. 2-300. - Legislative findings. 
    The city commission hereby finds that it serves a legitimate government purpose for the city to establish a jobs growth incentive grant program. Further, the city commission finds that there is a public need to enhance and stimulate economic activity in specific targeted areas of the City of Winter Springs including but not limited to, the Greeneway Interchange District, the Town Center District, the Village Walk District, or other targeted areas. The economic well-being of the residents of Winter Springs and Seminole County will be enhanced by the provision of a jobs growth incentive grant program. The city commission also finds that attracting, retaining and providing favorable conditions for the growth of target industries and businesses within targeted areas of the city provides employment opportunities for residents of the city and will optimize and diversify the economic tax base of the city. In addition, to stimulate and enhance economic activity in targeted areas of the city and to improve the prosperity of its residents, it is necessary and in the public interest for the city to establish a funding source that may be utilized to fund the jobs growth incentive grant program and provide incentives to appropriate target industries and businesses in targeted areas of the city.

Sec. 5-9. - Tree replacement guidelines. 
(a)  Tree replacement. All trees that are removed or destroyed and subject to replacement by this chapter shall be replaced by a species of tree cited in Appendix B, desirable trees or such other trees properly approved by the city arborist. Replacement shall occur prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (if approval is pending) or within sixty (60) days of removal or destruction, whichever date is earlier, unless a greater replacement period is provided for good cause by permit. 
(b)  Criteria for replacement trees is as follows: 
(1)  Characteristics of replacement trees. The replacement tree(s) shall have at least equal shade potential, screening properties, and/or other characteristics comparable to that of the tree(s) requested to be removed. 
(2)  Size of replacement trees. Replacement tree(s) are to be made according to the tree replacement standards set forth in Table 1 [at the end of this section]; or (2) otherwise agreed upon by the city commission and applicant. 
(3)  Tree species. Relocated or replacement trees shall include only species and sizes defined as desirable trees (Appendix B) under this chapter. 
(4)  Transplanting and maintenance requirements. All trees transplanted pursuant to this chapter shall be maintained in a healthy, living condition. Any such trees which die shall be replaced and maintained by the property owner. The city shall retain jurisdiction for one (1) year to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
(5)  Waivers of replacement tree(s) specifications. 
a.  General waivers. The number of required replacement trees may be waived by the city commission, if the city commission determines that the remaining number of trees to be preserved on site are of sufficient number and quality to substantially comply with the purpose and intent of this chapter and a tree replacement fee is paid to the city's "tree bank," which is hereby established. Monies collected in the tree bank shall be used for enhancement and maintenance of trees on public lands. The contribution to the tree bank may be waived by the city commission for individual homeowners, on a case-by-case basis, if the homeowner can demonstrate that the payment of the fee will cause the homeowner an undue economic hardship. Substitute tree(s) allowed under this waiver provision must have the approval of the city commission. The amount to be paid into the tree bank shall be set forth in Table 1 and should be based upon wholesale market value of the trees being replaced, plus installation and maintenance costs to establish the tree. 
b.  Renewable resource waivers. The tree replacement and tree bank requirements of this section shall not apply if a permit based on sections 5-4(b)(8) and 5-4(c)(4) is issued. If the permittee does not maintain and operate the permitted energy device for at least three (3) years, the permittee must replace the removed trees or pay a tree replacement fee to the city's tree bank as required by this section. 
(6)  Replacement guidelines. The following tree replacement guidelines shall apply: 
a.  All plant material specified shall be Florida Grades and Standard One (1) or better. 
b.  For each tree located within a public conservation area (excluding jurisdictional wetlands determined by the St. John's River Water Management District or the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, or as depicted on Map V-3: Existing Wetlands in the City of Winter Springs Comprehensive Plan) dedicated to the city as part of a development project, three (3) replacement tree credits may be applied to the total number of trees required to be replaced by this chapter. However, the minimum tree requirement set forth in section 5-13 shall still apply. Such public conservation area must be at least one (1) acre with widths not less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, unless otherwise approved by the city commission. In addition, trees approved by the city arborist to reforest such conservation area shall also be applied to the replacement requirement on a one-for-one basis. 
c.  If the city commission determines, due to site conditions or configuration, it is impossible or impracticable for the applicant/developer to meet the requirements for tree replacement, under this subsection, the city commission may allow the applicant/developer to pay into the city's "tree bank" the amount it would have spent on replacement trees. 
d.  Tree replacement credit shall be allowed for the installation of preferred plants in accordance with the provisions set forth in Appendix B: Desirable Trees. In addition, for new development, tree replacement credit shall be allowed for the preservation of existing Desirable Trees on the development site, excluding wetland areas and existing conservation areas, as follows: 
DBH of Preserved Tree Reduction in Replacement Trees 4? up to but not including 9? 1 credit  9? up to but not including 12? 2 credits 12? up to but not including 16? 3 credits 16? up to but not including 24? 4 credits Specimen and Historic Trees 0 credits  
e.  Trees planted under a powerline shall not exceed a mature height of twenty-five (25) feet. 
f.  Diversity of species shall be required for replacement trees and not more than twenty (20) percent of the replacement trees shall be of a single species. 
g.  All landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect licensed by the State of Florida, unless the city determines the proposed landscaping or tree removal has a deminimus impact on the property. 
(c)  Replacement cost. The property owner shall be responsible for the cost of replacing the trees removed from their property. 
(d)  Elimination of undesirable trees and shrubs. The natural vegetative communities existing within the city shall be protected by the control and elimination of invasive, nonnative species. To that end, the following guidelines shall apply: 
(1)  Planting of trees and shrubs listed in Appendix A, Undesirable Trees, is prohibited. 
(2)  Removal of trees and shrubs listed on Appendix A, Undesirable Trees, from commercial, office, industrial, or multifamily sites (excluding jurisdictional wetlands) shall be completed, whenever practicable, as a requirement for approval of any development permit issued by the city or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy if applicable. 
(3)  Control and elimination procedures shall in no way promote the proliferation of the species through the dispersal of seed or other vegetatively reproducing parts. 
(4)  Control and elimination procedures shall in no way harm or cause the decline of preserved or planted trees and landscaping. 
(e)  Limited exception for existing single-family lots. Notwithstanding any other tree replacement standard set forth in this section, a tree removal permit for a single tree shall be granted, as a matter of right, for each existing single family home lot, provided the city arborist determines that: 
(1)  The tree is not a specimen or historic tree; 
(2)  The tree canopy covering the pervious portion of the lot after removal of the tree will be greater than fifty (50) percent; and 
(3)  A permit under this subsection (e) had not been granted during the preceding ten-year period.

Sec. 5-10. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  Placement of materials, machinery, or temporary soil deposits. It shall be unlawful to place material, machinery, or temporary soil deposits within the tree protection zone, as calculated according to Appendix C: Calculating Tree Protection Zone, before or during construction. Before or during construction the builder shall erect and maintain suitable protective barriers around all trees to be preserved. Upon written request, the city arborist, on a case by case basis, may allow material or temporary soil deposits to be stored within the protective barrier if no other storage is available. 
(b)  Climbing spurs. It shall be unlawful to use climbing spurs or other similar device to aid in the climbing of a live tree, where such device causes the puncture or tears the bark of the tree. 
(c)  Tree spiking. It shall be unlawful to introduce any type of poison or reactive material to a tree for the purpose of causing it to die or become diseased. 
(d)  Structure and pavement location. It shall be unlawful to place any structure or impervious paving within eight-foot radius of any tree trunk or stem having a DBH of four (4) inches or more at caliper. 
(e)  City trees. It shall be unlawful to trim, prune, or remove any tree which is within the city's rights-of-way or upon any other city property without the permission of the city evidenced by the appropriate permit.

Neither shall the developer cause or allow the disposal of waste material such as paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or any other material harmful to the life of a tree within the dripline of any tree or groups of trees, or where planting beds are to be situated. 
(i)  Shearing, hat racking, topping or poodle trimming of trees (lollipop), lions-tailing, pollarding of Trees. Trees intended for shade purposes shall be allowed to reach their mature canopy spread. It shall be unlawful to engage in excessive pruning techniques on trees intended for shade purposes. Excessive shearing, pruning or shaping shall only be allowed with a permit by demonstrating necessity or without a permit in times of emergency only. The following are deemed unlawful excessive pruning techniques which are prohibited on shade trees: 
(1)  Lions tailing : The improper practice of removing most secondary and tertiary branches from the interior portion of the canopy leaving most live foliage at the edge of the canopy. 
(2)  Topping, hatracking, stag heading, de-horning, lopping, and rounding over : the improper practice of reducing tree size by making heading cuts through a stem more than two (2) years old; a pruning practice that destroys tree architecture and serves to initiate discoloration and perhaps decay in the cut stem. 
(3)  Pollarding : The pruning technique that removes sprouts back to the same location annually or biannually maintaining a tree to a specific height. 
(4)  Shearing : A pruning technique which is typically accomplished with cuts made through wood less than a year old at the sides of the canopy to create uniform dense canopies. 
(5)  Poodle trimming : Combines shearing and removing lower limbs to create tree forms that look like a "lollipop." 
(j)  Construction near adjacent property. Walls, structures, and pavement shall not be constructed in any way which will result in damage to roots within the tree protection zones of trees located on adjacent properties. 
(Ord. No. 2002-08, § 2, 4-8-02; 2003-22, § 2, 10-13-03; Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 2-27-12) 
Sec. 5-11. - Reserved. 
Sec. 5-12. - Permit contents; expiration; removal after expiration of permit.

(a)  Waivers . The city commission may grant a waiver to provisions of this chapter where the applicant demonstrates that the literal interpretation of the chapter will deny the applicant reasonable use of the property or where such waiver can be demonstrated to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the chapter. The preservation of any approved tree over four (4) inches in DBH may be considered as the basis for the granting of a waiver from the literal application of the provisions of the city's land development regulations. If, in the determination of the city commission, the sole basis for the request for waiver is to preserve such tree which would otherwise have to be removed, it may direct any required waiver fee to be waived. 
(b)  Appeals . Any person adversely affected by an administrative interpretation of this chapter by the city arborist may first appeal that interpretation to the city manager by filing a written notice of appeal of said interpretation within ten (10) calendar days of said interpretation. The city manager shall decide said appeal within five (5) business days. Any person adversely affected by an administrative decision of the city manager under this chapter may appeal that interpretation to the city commission by filing a written notice of appeal of said interpretation within thirty (30) calendar days of said interpretation. Failure to file an appeal within the time periods required by this subsection shall result in the administrative interpretation to be declared final and shall be deemed a waiver of the person's right to further appellate review and proceedings. The city commission shall decide said appeal within thirty (30) days of the city's receipt of said notice of appeal and the city commission's decision shall be final. Except for the mandatory time periods required for the notice of appeal, the time periods required for a decision may be extended by mutual agreement between the city and the person filing the notice of appeal. 
(c)  Incentive program. The city commission reserves the right to offer and approve incentives for purposes of protecting and preserving mature trees and planting enhanced landscaping. Such incentives shall have a public benefit and may include, but are not limited to, varying provisions of the city's land development regulations (e.g. reduced parking; modified setbacks) and providing credits to city development fees. Any incentives granted under this subsection shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan and shall be by development agreement or other formal approval.

APPENDIX C CALCULATING TREE PROTECTION ZONE 
The following guidelines shall be applied to determine the Tree Protection Zone: 
1.  Evaluate the species tolerance of the tree: good, moderate, or poor (See list on next page) 
2.  Identify tree age: young (<20% of the tree's life expectancy), mature (20% - 80% of the tree's life expectancy), or overmature (>80% of the tree's life expectancy) 
3.  Using the table below, find the distance from the trunk that should be protected per inch of trunk diameter. 
4.  Multiply the distance by the trunk diameter to calculate the optimum radius (in feet) for the tree protection zone. 
Example: 
A healthy 60-year old, 30? diameter California black walnut (poor tolerance, mature age) 
1.25' × 30? = 37.5' radius tree protection zone.

Accessory buildings shall include storage buildings, toolhouses, private, detached garages, bathhouses (used in conjunction with swimming pool) and similar uses. No more than two (2) accessory buildings shall be allowed on any single lot.

e.  The accessory building shall meet the requirements of the applicable zoning district including setback and maximum lot coverage. 
(2)  An accessory building that is attached to a principal structure by a breezeway is not considered an accessory building, but rather, is considered an expansion of the principal structure and is subject to satisfying all applicable requirements, including, but not limited to, setbacks and maximum lot coverage, of the zoning district in which the principal structure is located. It may therefore, exceed the height and size restrictions as noted above in subsection (b)(1); however, it shall not exceed the height of the principal structure.

(1)  No accessory building shall be constructed or placed on an easement unless the easement expressly authorizes an accessory building to be constructed and maintained within the easement area. 
(2)  Detached, private garages which exceed twelve (12) feet in height or two hundred forty (240) square feet in area must meet the setbacks of the applicable zoning district for the principal structure.

b.  The proposed accessory building will not adversely impact land use activities in the immediate vicinity; 
c.  The height of the proposed accessory building does not exceed the height of the principal structure; and 
d.  The accessory building shall meet the requirements of the applicable zoning district including setback and maximum lot coverage. 
(4)  An accessory building may be constructed on a lot adjacent to the lot on which the principal building is located under the following conditions: 
a.  The conditions set forth in subsections (1), (2), and (3) are satisfied. 
b.

The design is subject to the minimum community appearance and aesthetic review standards to ensure residential compatibility and harmony (see section 9-600 et. seq.). 
(o)  Privacy. Privacy and screening of adjacent properties is of utmost importance in the orientation of the ADU. Entrance and windows of the ADU shall face the interior of the lot and/or public street as much as possible. Windows which do face the adjoining property shall be designed to protect the privacy of neighbors. Landscaping shall be used to further provide for the privacy and screening of adjacent properties. 
(p)  Expiration. As with all conditional use approvals, if a building permit has not been issued within two (2) years for the ADU, the approval becomes null and void (see section 20-36). 
(q)  Approval process. The conditional use/aesthetic review approval of an ADU is subject to a public hearing. A notice will be sent to all property owners within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the subject property. An ADU will not be approved if prohibited by the declarations, covenants, conditions and restrictions of a homeowners' association. The city commission may impose reasonable conditions of approval to the extent deemed necessary and relevant to ensure compliance with applicable criteria and other applicable provisions of the city code and comprehensive plan (see section 20-27 and section 20-33).

For the purpose of determining rate structures, existing construction means the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the first FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. This term may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before August 11, 1981. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map. The official map on which the administrator has delineated both the flood boundaries and the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood elevation determination. A determination by the administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one-percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM). An official map, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodplain. Land which will be inundated by floods known to have occurred or reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur from the overflow of inland or tidal waters and the accumulation of runoff of surface waters from rainfall. 
    Floodplain administrator. The individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations. Any zoning ordinances, land development ordinance, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain management ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police powers. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing. Structural changes or adjustments incorporated in the design or construction of a building so as to make the building watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capacity of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
    Floodway. See "regulatory floodway." 
    Floodway encroachment line. The line marking the limits of floodway maps on federal, state and local floodplain maps. 
    Floodway fringe. That area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway." 
    Fraud and victimization. As related to section 8-34, variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    Freeboard. The additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet, above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of the urbanization of the watershed that could contribute to the flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
    Functionally dependent use. A use of a building or other development, which cannot be achieved unless the building or other development is located in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Governing body. The City Commission of Winter Springs, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    Hardship. As related to section 8-34, variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the applicant prove that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure. Any structure that is:

(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district. 
    Lowest adjacent grade. The lowest elevation of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support or basement entryway immediately next to the structure, after completion of construction. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of the chapter. 
    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level (MSL). The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). 
    Mobile home. See Manufactured home. 
    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction. Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. See Base flood. 
    Public safety and nuisance. As related to section 8-34, variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory flood. For purposes of this chapter, a flood event having a one-percent chance of occurring in any given year, although the flood may occur in any year, i.e., the hundred-year flood.

    Regulatory floodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the velocity waters of the regulatory flood. 
    Remedy a violation. To bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Sheet flow area. See Area of shallow flooding. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA). The same area of the special flood hazard and shown on the FIRM as Zone A, AE, and AH. 
    Start of construction (includes substantial improvement). The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure. A walled and roofed building, that is principally aboveground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a mobile home on a foundation. The term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. The words "building" and "structure" shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this chapter. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the appraised value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market appraised value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation. The height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

(Code 1974, § 19-7; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-7. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Code 1974, § 19-8; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-8. - Warning regarding area of special flood hazard designations. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the State of Florida, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. In addition, nothing herein shall be deemed as a waiver of the city's right to sovereign immunity under state and federal law.

ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 8-31. - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
    The city manager is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to administer and implement this chapter. The city manager may delegate the responsibilities for the individual tasks contained herein. 
(Code 1974, § 19-10; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-32. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    Duties of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Permit review. Review all building and development permits to determine that: 
a.  The requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
b.  All necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required; 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
d.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the flood-carrying capacity and/or flood-storage capacity of the areas of special flood hazard. For the purposes of this article, "adversely affect" means damage to adjacent properties because of rises in flood stages attributed to physical changes of the channel and the adjacent overbank areas. Without limiting the foregoing, a development is presumed to adversely affect the flood-carrying and flood-storage capacities of the floodplain if it proposes or requires the filling of land in an area of special flood hazard without simultaneously providing additional flood-carrying and flood-storage capacities to compensate for that capacity which is lost because of such filling. 
(2)  Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in section 8-34. 
(3)  Use of other base flood data. To supplement the base flood elevation data provided in accordance with section 8-5, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, state water management districts development plans for more than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres) as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A meet the requirements of section 8-52(1), specific standards, residential construction, and section 8-52(2). 
(4)  Issuance of permit and record keeping. After ascertaining that all requirements of this chapter have been met, the floodplain administrator may issue the building or development permit. After issuance of the permit, the local administrator shall: 
a.  Acquire a flood elevation or floodproofing certificate after the lowest floor is completed. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of establishment of the lowest floor elevation or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the city manager a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Such certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, such certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work done within the twenty-one-day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The city manager or designated subordinate shall review the flood elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make such corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project. 
b.  Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Control of alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities, the St. Johns River Water Management District, and the state department of community affairs prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. 
b.  Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(6)  Take remedial action on any violations of this chapter. 
(Code 1974, § 19-12; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01; Ord. No. 2007-32, § 2, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 8-33. - Development permit. 
(a)  Establishment of permit. A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in section 8-5. 
(1)  New developments. When new development proposals include lands designated as areas of special flood hazard, the aforementioned development permit shall not be issued until all applicable requirements of chapter 9 of this Code have been fulfilled. Specifically, the procedures outlined in section 9-101(a)(2) shall be required. In addition, the provisions of section 9-241 which exceed the provisions of this chapter, shall apply and be prerequisites to issuance of the development permit. 
(2)  Construction in existing developments. Already developed lands within or including areas of special flood hazard in this city for which building permits are requested shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter, as shall lands described in (a) above. After land development is completed no construction of any nature, neither buildings, nor site preparation, nor modification of existing roads, utilities, drainage systems or other nonstructural improvements shall be allowed within areas of special flood hazard until the development permit herein required has been issued. 
(b)  Application for permit. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans in triplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required with application for the development permit: 
(1)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures. 
(2)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed. 
(3)  Certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure meets the floodproofing criteria in section 8-52(2). 
(4)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

(1)  The city commission as established by the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The city commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Those aggrieved by the decision of the city commission or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the circuit court. 
(b)  Conditions under which variances may be granted. 
(1)  In passing upon such application, the city commission, shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and, the danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program of that area; the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed user and the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in (b)(1) above; or conflict with the local government comprehensive plan or with other existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a specific, reduced lowest floor elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(7)  The city commission may attach such conditions to the granting of any variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(8)  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Sec. 8-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in section 8-5 or in section 8-32 the following standards are required: 
(1)  Residential construction: New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to eighteen (18) inches above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction: New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to eighteen (18) inches above the level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, who shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of this chapter. Such certificates, which include the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the local administrator as set forth in section 8-32(4)a. 
(3)  Mobile homes: 
a.  Mobile homes shall be anchored in accordance with section 8-51(1)b. 
b.  For new mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions, for expansions to existing mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions, for existing mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement has commenced, and for mobile homes not placed in a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, it is required that: 
1.  Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the mobile home will be at or above the base flood level; 
2.  Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler are provided; and 
3.  In the instance of elevation on pilings, that lots are large enough to permit steps, piling foundations are placed in stable soil no more than ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for pilings more than six (6) feet above the ground level. 
c.  No mobile home shall be placed in a regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area, except in an existing mobile home park or an existing mobile home subdivision. 
(4)  Enclosed areas below a structure's lowest floor: For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(5)  Mechanical and utility equipment: New installation and substantial improvement of any electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be elevated above the base flood elevation or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the equipment components during conditions of flooding. 
(Code 1974, § 19-15; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-53. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-5 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade (if no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade) or, 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(Code 1974, § 19-16; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-54. - Standards for small streams. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-5, where small streams exist but where no base flood data have been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five (5) times the width of the stream at the top of bank or twenty (20) feet on each side from top of bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations established in accordance with section 8-32(3). 
(Code 1974, § 19-17; Ord. No. 2001-04, § 1, 1-22-01) 
Sec. 8-55. - Standards for regulatory flood- ways. 
    When floodways are designated within areas of special flood hazard, additional criteria will be met. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments. 
(2)  The prohibition shall not preclude the city or other governmental agency from performing maintenance or flood control improvements in the floodway to maintain the viability of the floodway.

(d)  Retention/detention ponds. 
(1)  Dry bottom ponds. All dry bottom retention/detention ponds will have a pond bottom elevation of no less than one (1) foot (twelve (12) inches) above the seasonal high ground water elevation, which is to be determined by a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida with an expertise in soils. The side slopes of all dry bottom retention/detention ponds shall not be steeper than two and one-half (21/2) horizontal to one (1) vertical. All dry bottom ponds with no exceptions, in which the side slopes are steeper than four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical shall require a green vinyl chainlink fence with a minimum height of four (4) feet. All fences must meet setback requirements in section 6-193, buildings and building regulations. 
(2)  Wet bottom ponds. All wet bottom ponds must have side slopes no steeper than four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical measured from the top of the berm down to at least three (3) feet below the normal water level, measured vertically. This is the side slope transition point. Side slopes may then transition, from the transition point, to no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical down to the pond bottom. Wet bottom pond side slopes steeper than these values are not allowed. If a fence is used, it must be of the same specifications as the fence for dry bottom ponds. 
(3)  All ponds. Retention, detention, percolation, and treatment of stormwater are required by the city. Stormwater regulations, criteria and requirements of the State of Florida, St. Johns River Water Management District and the Department of Environmental Protection, as they may exist and be modified from time to time, are to be the regulations, criteria, and requirements which the city shall utilize for review of stormwater facilities. All city stormwater requirements shall also apply in addition to any federal and state requirement. If there is a conflict between requirements, the stricter requirement will apply. All ponds shall have a minimum ten (10) foot wide stabilized maintenance berm capable of supporting a maintenance vehicle. There shall be a minimum ten (10) foot wide easement to each pond dedicated to the city and the homeowners' association (if planned). All fenced ponds must have a locked gate with ten-foot wide gate opening.

Existing flood storage quantities shall not be reduced by development from that which existed on-site prior to development. Pre and post-development volume must be adhered to with additional compensating storage for all floodwater displaced by development below the elevation of the hundred-year flood as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the latest official panel of the flood insurance rate map. Compensating storage is to be calculated between the hundred-year flood elevation and the seasonal high water table. The seasonal high water table shall be established by a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida with expertise in geotechnical engineering based on recent soil borings on the subject site. There must be at least one (1) soil boring per pond, performed at the proposed location of the pond. 
(g)  The development of each phase of a development shall be capable of standing on its own if subsequent areas planned for development are not developed. 
(h)  Inlet spacing. Inlets shall be spaced in such a manner as to accept one hundred (100) percent of runoff. Typically, the maximum allowable gutter run will be seven hundred fifty (750) feet on streets with curbs, unless specifically excepted by the city engineer. On streets other than streets with curbs, the actual required spacing will depend on the characteristics of each particular site. Calculations will be provided to show the hydraulic grade line (water level) in all inlets and storm water manholes when the pond reaches its maximum stage water elevation during the design storm. At no time will the hydraulic grade line be allowed to be higher than the edge-of-pavement at inlets and at no time be higher than the manhole rim at storm water manholes. See subsection 9-300 for standard curb inlet. Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) inlets may be used at the discretion of the city engineer. 
(i)  Lot grading. To facilitate proper stormwater surface runoff from residential lots, the minimum residential lot line slope that can be accepted is one and one-quarter (1.25) percent. This will only be allowed in areas that have good percolation of rainfall into the soils. In areas that do not have good percolation of rainfall into the soils, the minimum lot line slope that can be accepted is one and one-half (1.50) percent. 
The determination of good percolation of soils will be made by the city engineer based on a recent soils report by a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida with an expertise in soils. The soils report may have to include the results of a recent soil permeability test if required by the city engineer.

Sec. 9-242. - Drainage facilities. 
(a)  Roadside swales within street rights-of-way shall have side slopes and back slopes no steeper than four (4) to one (1). Normal swale sections shall be a minimum of six (6) inches deep with a maximum depth of twelve (12) inches below the outside edge of the street pavement. Runoff may be accumulated and carried in the swales in the rights-of-way up to but not above the point where flooding of the shoulders or roadside property would occur. Water in excess of this quantity shall be diverted from the roadside swales and carried away by storm sewers or other approved means. Where flow velocities in excess of two (2) feet per second are anticipated, curb and gutter shall be provided, unless excepted by the city engineer. 
(b)  Open channels and outfall ditches where allowed shall be designed so as to provide an eighteen-inch clearance between the design water surface and bank top and shall be designed for flow velocities not to exceed two (2) feet per second. Where higher velocities are anticipated, other adequate permanent protection against scour shall be provided. The construction of any artificial canals, ditches, channels or the construction of major storm sewer systems which will rapidly convey runoff to any receiving waters or substantially reduce the level of the groundwater table, is expressly prohibited except on authority of the city engineer. 
(c)  Street subdrains or underdrains may be required where soil and water conditions warrant. All underdrain trenches shall be back-filled to the surface with clean, permeable, free draining sand in accordance with FDOT 902-4. Underdrains shall have knitted polyester filter material surrounding the drain. Exposed underdrain outlets and clean-outs shall be concrete with animal guards. 
(d)  Underground drainage systems shall include one (1) or more of the following which shall meet the specifications of the city engineer as to composition and size: 
(1)  Reinforced concrete pipe. 
(2)  Asphalt-coated corrugated metal pipe. 
(3)  Approved equal materials including aluminum. 
(4)  Reinforced concrete box culverts. 
(5)  Drainage inlets, headwalls, manholes and appurtenant facilities.

[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] 
water and/or sewer trunk line system, the plat for the subdivision will not be recorded unless and except when the trunk line systems are installed or the installation of the system is ensured by means of a performance bond. 
(b)  In no event shall the city be required to pay the cost of the installation of the water and sewer trunk line system. 
(c)  New water and sewer systems where required shall be designed and constructed for an economic life of not less than twenty (20) years and in accordance with the regulations of Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, Ten States Standards, American Water Works Association, and in conformance with good engineering practice. As a minimum standard, the water distribution system shall be capable of delivering, in addition to domestic requirements of residual pressures of not less than twenty (20) pounds per square inch, fire flows of at least five hundred (500) gallons per minute in single-family residential subdivisions and one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) gallons per minute in commercial, institutional or industrial areas at each user point of delivery adjacent to the distribution system. Criteria for fire flow requirements for multifamily projects will be determined by the fire chief of the city. Fire hydrants shall be spaced no greater than seven hundred fifty (750) feet apart in residential areas and three hundred fifty (350) feet apart in commercial or industrial areas, and shall be connected and approved to mains no less than six (6) inches in diameter. Plans for fire hydrants shall be approved by the fire chief of the city. The fire hydrants shall be installed by the developer at no cost to the city. Sufficient storage and/or emergency pumping facilities shall be provided to such an extent that the minimum fire flows will be maintained for at least four (4) hours. The requirement for fire hydrants may be waived temporarily by city council upon recommendation of the fire chief in areas where adequate mains are not available, but in such case, the builder must place in escrow an amount equal to the cost of such hydrants plus an additional twenty-five (25) percent to provide for their connection as soon as adequate mains become available, and such funds may be used for no other purpose. In any case, the distribution system shall comply with the above requirements. A lateral separation of at least ten (10) feet shall be maintained between water and sanitary sewer lines. Where the minimum separation cannot be maintained, the crossing shall be arranged so that the sewer pipe joints are equidistance from the point of crossing with no less than ten (10) feet between any two (2) joints. In addition, the sewer main is to be placed in a ductile iron pipe sleeve or encased in concrete. Minimum cover over all pipe shall be thirty-six (36) inches to finish grade, except minimum cover over two-inch or one and one-half inch water service piping may be reduced to twenty (20) inches at sewer crossings in order to achieve the eighteen-inch vertical clearance. All water mains, located within a cul-de-sac are to be looped. 
(d)  Where lakes or ponds are considered an integral part of the firefighting system, access to such water bodies will be provided for firefighting equipment, and such access is to be designated for that purpose. 
(e)  Entry gates or other restrictive entry devices to any area shall be designed in such a manner as to break away upon impact without damaging firefighting equipment. 
(f)  The water system for any development will be subject to the review of the fire chief prior to staff review, and approval thereof is a requirement of approval of final plans.

Sec. 9-278. - General provisions for off-street parking. 
    The off-street parking, loading and unloading requirements shall apply to all new buildings or structures, or any existing buildings that may be substantially altered and added to after the effective date of this section, except as otherwise provided in the sections of this Code. 
(1)  Change in intensity of use. Whenever a building or structure erected prior to or after the effective date of this section shall undergo any increase in number of dwelling units, gross floor space, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit measure specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities and further, when the increase would result in a requirement for additional parking or loading and unloading facilities through application thereto of the off-street parking regulations of the sections of this Code, such additional facilities shall be provided accordingly, except that no building or structure erected prior to the effective date of this section shall be required to provide parking or loading facilities unless the aforesaid additional required facilities amount to an increase of at least twenty-five (25) percent, in which case, parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the basis of the additional units of measurements of the new use or of the altered or expanded use. When a building or structure shall undergo any decrease in number of dwelling units, gross floor space, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities, and further, when the decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total parking spaces or loading spaces through application thereto to the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of the sections of this Code, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly, provided that existing parking and loading facilities shall be so decreased only when facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading and unloading requirements resulting from application of the sections of this Code, to the entire building or structure as modified. 
(2)  Minimum distance and setbacks. The parking space, if on the same lot with a main building, shall not be located within the front yard required by the sections of this Code for such building. If not on the same lot with the principal building, the parking lot shall not be closer to any street line than the established building line on adjacent properties, or less than the setback required for the district in which the parking area is located. Further, any wall, fence of hedge developed along the street side of the parking lot shall observe the building setback requirements applicable on such street or streets. 
(3)  Screening and landscaping. All parking lots shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential or multiple dwelling district by a wall, fence or densely planted, compact hedge. Such wall, fence or hedge shall be not less than three (3) feet nor more than four (4) feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition. 
(4)  Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking lot shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining properties. 
(5)  Plot plan showing location of parking area. No application for a building permit for a new, enlarged or altered structure or improvement or use shall be approved unless accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, showing the required off-street automobile parking facilities as specified herein; nor shall a permit be issued for the improvement of a parking area to serve as an accessory use to an existing building or buildings until a plat plan drawn to scale has been submitted in accordance with the provisions contained herein. 
(6)  Certificate of occupancy or use permits. No certificate of occupancy or use permits will be issued upon completion of any building or addition which would require an increase in parking space or off-street loading and unloading space, unless and until all off-street parking and loading space requirements, shown upon the plans, are made a part of the building permit, shall be in place and determined by the building official to be ready for use. 
(7)  Reserved. 
(8)  Loading space. As required under off-street loading and unloading regulations, the space supplied for such off-street loading and unloading purposes shall not be construed as supplying required off-street parking space. 
(9)  Location of parking spaces. Parking spaces provided pursuant to this section must be graveled or hard-surfaced and properly drained and shall be located on the same property as the principal building, or on a properly zoned lot within three hundred (300) feet of the building. Such distance shall be walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking lot to the nearest boundary of the property on which the building is located and that the parking lot is required to serve. In determining automobile parking spaces, if not shown by actual plan and count, three hundred (300) square feet of gross area per parking space will be used in computing the number of spaces. When units of measurements determining the number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces result in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and over one-half shall require one (1) off-street parking space or one (1) off-street loading space. 
(10)  Collective action relative to off-street parking and loading. Nothing in the sections of this Code shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two (2) or more buildings or uses if the total of such spaces, when used together, shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of the sections of this Code. 
(11)  Mixed uses. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements of off-street parking and loading space shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately as specified in the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of the sections of this Code, and the off-street parking and off-street loading and unloading space for one (1) use shall not be construed as providing the required off-street parking or off-street loading space for any other use. 
(12)  Use of required off-street parking by another building. No part of an off-street parking lot required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the sections of this Code, shall be included as a part of off-street parking area, similarly required for other buildings or uses, unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of usage of such structures will not be simultaneously used with each other, such determination to be made by the planning and zoning board; or unless the size of the off-street parking lot is sufficient to comply with the provisions of the sections of this Code. 
(13)  Remote parking lots encumbered. Where the provisions of the off-street parking for a building or other use established subsequent to the adoption of this section involves one (1) or more parcels or tracts of land that are not a part of the plat on which the principal use is situated, the applicant for a permit for the principal use shall submit with his application for a building permit an instrument duly executed and acknowledged, which subjects such parcels or tracts of land to parking uses in connection with the principal use for which it is available; provided, however, that such encumbrance shall only be effective for the period of time during which the certificate of occupancy is in effect for the particular use for which the building permit is issued. However, the new occupant must still meet the requirements for such new occupancy as provided by the sections of this Code. The applicant shall deposit the necessary recording fee and upon issuance of a building permit, the building official of the city shall cause such instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county circuit court. Such encumbrances shall be null and void and of no effect, if and when the city shall rescind or terminate off-street parking requirements for the building to be served by the encumbered lot, parcel or tract. 
(14)  Powers of variance of city commission. The city commission is hereby authorized and empowered after a proper hearing thereon with due notice to the interested parties, to permit a variation or modification in the required location of off-street parking space, if after investigation by such board it is found that such variation is necessary to prevent unreasonable hardship or to secure an appropriate development of a specified parcel of land which has peculiar or exceptional geographical or topographical conditions, or is a size, shape, dimension, or location that it cannot be reasonably developed in accordance with the provisions of sections of this Code, as herein authorized will not be inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of this section. In granting any variations or modifications as herein authorized such city commission may impose conditions and limitations in respect to the proposed use and development of the premises as in its judgment are necessary in order to provide adequately for the public safety and to do substantial justice to the parties involved, having in mind the public interest, safety and welfare in connection therewith; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to limit or curtail the existing authorities and powers of the city commission, and this provision shall be deemed cumulative, and in addition to such existing powers and authorities. 
(15)  Accessory parking in residential areas. A lot or lots separated by a common boundary from a commercial district but located in a R-1A or R-1AA single-family dwelling district may be used as a free parking lot or lots to service the contiguous and adjoining commercial use or uses, provided, however, that: 
a.  No advertising signs are erected in the area. 
b.  The setback from the front property line shall be the same as for the district in which the lot or lots are located. 
c.  All automobile parking lots shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential or single-family dwelling district by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge. Such wall, densely planted hedge or fence shall not be less than four (4) feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition. 
d.  No structures shall be erected in such areas. 
(16)  Common boundary construed. For the purpose of (15) above, the term common boundary shall be deemed to include all or any part of a line between a commercial district and an R-1, R-1A or R-1AA single-family dwelling district, or the separation of a commercial district from an R-1, R-1A, and R-1AA single-family dwelling district by an intervening public street, alley or other way where the parcels in question lie wholly or partly in a position directly opposite from each other in such a manner that in the absence of the public street, alley or way, the parcels would have a common boundary line in whole or in part. 
(Ord. No. 44, § 44.73, 1-8-68; Ord. No. 2003-36, § 10-13-03; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 9-279. - Off-street parking of commercial vehicles. 
    Except for the temporary parking of vehicles conducting business on the premises or engaged in the loading or delivering of materials, no overnight parking of tractor trailers, cube vans, semitrailers and/or cabs shall be permitted on any off-street parking facility within the city. Vehicles owned or operated by the business located on the licensed premises may be parked overnight provided that they are parked behind the business or, if sufficient rear lot space is not available, in the least visible space from any right-of-way and abutting property. A special events permit may be obtained for a period not to exceed fourteen (14) days for the temporary parking of a trailer, semitrailer, and/or their cabs for special occasions. After ninety (90) days, this permit may be renewed once during a twelve-month period.

    The fee rate schedule is presented for the convenience of the public and may be used in lieu of the independent method of calculation set forth in section 9-386.8. The fee rates have been calculated using the method of calculation presented in section 9-386.8 using recognized accepted trip generation rates based upon acceptable national and local averages. For the convenience of the public the fee rates which are based on trip generation have been converted to dollar amounts per unit of development, i.e., per dwelling unit, per one thousand (1,000) square feet, per room, etc., depending upon the type or classification of land development. The road impact fee is determined by the following provisions: 
(1)  Road impact fee rate schedule set forth in this section. 
(2)  The total road impact fee for a specified type of land development activity is calculated by multiplying the impact fee rate for the specified type of land development activity by the number of units of development of the specified type of development activity. 
(3)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure, the total road impact fee assessment shall be the sum of the products, as calculated above, for each and every building, structure or other use, including each and every use within a building or structure, unless otherwise provided for in this division. 
(4)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing building, structure or other land development activity which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the new increase in the impact fee for the new or proposed land development activity as compared to the existing or last previous land use or activity. 
(5)  In the case of a demolition of an existing building or structure, the impact fee for future redevelopment shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new or proposed land development activity as compared to the land use or activity existing prior to demolition. Credit for the prior use shall not be transferable to another location. 
(6)  In the case of a relocation of a building or structure, an impact fee shall be assessed to the relocated building at its new location. Future redevelopment of the old location from which the building was removed will receive a credit against the impact fee assessed equal to the impact fee that would have been assessed against the relocated structure. Credits shall not be transferable to the new location. 
(7)  In order to take advantage of subsection (4), (5) or (6) (above) and pay impact fees only for the net increase in development activity, the applicant shall provide reasonably sufficient evidence that the previous land use or activity was actually maintained on the site at any time during the five-year period prior to the date of application for the new development approval. Such evidence may include proof of utility records, records for the use sought to be shown, or other documentation. Local business tax receipt issuance is not of itself substantial proof. 
(8)  In the event that an applicant for a building permit or the City of Winter Springs contends that the land use for which the building permit is proposed is not within the categories listed in the impact fee schedule set forth in this section, or fits within a different category, then the city manager, or his designee shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation which is consistent with current practices to add land use categories to the fee rate schedule following submission to the commission. In addition, either the city or the applicant can propose actual studies or surveys in order to calculate the most appropriate fee rate. Such determination may be appealed to the city commission by filing a written notice of appeal to the city manager or designee pursuant to section 9-386.21. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 638, § I, 2-10-97; Ord. No. 2006-23, § 5, 12-11-06; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.8. - Independent impact fee calculation. 
(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact of this development on the municipal collector road network will be less than that presumed in this division, the applicant may submit a proposed scope of work for determining an independent fee calculation which shall comply with the methodology in the latest transportation impact fee study adopted by the city commission to support this division. Upon approval of the scope of work the applicant may submit an independent fee calculation to the city manager or his designee, pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the city manager, or his designee, finds that the data, information and assumptions used by the applicant to calculate the independent impact fee satisfy the requirements of this section, the independent impact fee shall be deemed the impact fee due and owing for the proposed development. Since processing of independent impact fee calculations involves significant staff time, applicants should submit their independent impact fee calculation at least sixty (60) days prior to the date they will need a final determination of their impact fee. Alternatively, an applicant may pay the impact fee normally required at the time of seeking a building permit, subject to possible reimbursement of any excess paid according to the final independent impact fee determination. The city's costs for administering and evaluating the independent impact fee, including but not limited to the cost of independent consulting engineers, shall be borne by the applicant. 
(b)  In the event the city believes that the impact of the proposed development on the municipal collector road network is greater than that presumed in this division, the city may accomplish an alternative independent impact fee calculation to increase the transportation impact fee. This calculation shall comply with the methodology in the latest transportation impact fee study adopted by the city commission to support this division. The city manager or his designee shall notify the applicant in writing within five (5) workdays following the formal pre-application meeting with city staff concerning this project. If the city chooses to accomplish an independent impact fee calculation to increase the transportation impact fee for the proposed development, the cost of accomplishing such independent impact fee calculation shall be borne by the city. The city manager or his designee shall have final authority to determine the appropriate transportation impact fee for the proposed project based upon an evaluation of the city's independent impact fee calculation. 
(c)  Data, information and assumption requirements: The independent impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this division or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is an accepted standard source of transportation engineering or planning data; or 
(2)  The independent source is based on actual studies or surveys conducted in the Orlando Urban Area, or with the specific approval of the city manager, or his designee, in other urban areas and carried out by a qualified registered engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of transportation planning or engineering. 
(3)  The methodology used for the independent impact fee calculations shall use the same methodology as the latest transportation impact fee study adopted by the city commission. 
(d)  Total road impact fee calculation: The total road impact fee assessment for a specified type of land development activity generating traffic for which an application for a building permit has been made is calculated by use of the following formula: 
TIF = (IFR)(NUD) 
IFR = Impact fee rate for specific land use as determined in section 9.386.8(c)(3). 
NUD = Number of units in a development of the specified type of development activity. 
(e)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure, the total road impact fee assessment shall be the sum of the products, as calculated above, for each and every building, structure or other use, including each and every use within a building or structure, unless otherwise provided for in this division. 
(f)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing building, structure or other land development activity which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new or proposed land development activity as compared to the existing or last previous land use or activity. 
(g)  A determination by the city manager or his designee, that the independent calculation does not satisfy the requirements of this section may be appealed to the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 589, § I, 10-9-95; Ord. No. 638, § III, 2-10-97; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.9. - Presumption of maximum impact. 
    Development is presumed to have the maximum impact on the municipal collector road network. The proposed development activity for which an application for a building permit has been filed shall be presumed to generate the maximum number of average daily vehicle trips, vehicle miles of travel and lane miles of travel to be generated by the most appropriate land use category(s) as determined by the city manager, or his designee. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91) 
Sec. 9-386.10. - Impact agreement. 
    Any applicant may propose to enter into an impact agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service needs appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. 
(1)  Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to provisions which: 
a.  Modify the presumption of maximum impact set forth in section 9-386.9 and provide an impact fee which may differ from that set forth in section 9-386.7 by specifying the nature of the proposed development for purposes of computing actual trips, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the actual number of trips generated will not exceed the estimated trips generated by the agreed upon development. 
b.  Permit the construction of specific transportation improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the road impact fee assessable. 
c.  Permit a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular and unique circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 9-386.8, provided that security is posted ensuring payment of the fees, in a form acceptable to the city, which security may be in the form of a cash escrow deposit, surety bond, or letter of credit. 
(2)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection shall be presented to and approved by the city commission prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement shall provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders or contract purchasers in addition to the land owner, and shall require the applicant to record such agreement in the official records of Seminole County. The city commission shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with the principles set forth in Florida Statutes and case law. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.11. - Credits. 
(a)  An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against future road impact fees assessed pursuant to this division for contributions, dedications or improvements required by the city or through agreements with the city, as a condition of any development permit by the city, and said credit shall be in an amount equal to: 
(1)  The cost of non-site-related improvements to the municipal collector road network (including on-site and site-adjacent collectors to the extent such improvements are in excess of or in addition to site-related improvements); or 
(2)  The contribution of land, money or services for non-site-related improvements to the municipal collector road network (including on-site and site-adjacent municipal collectors to the extent such improvements are in excess of or in addition to site-related improvements); or 
(3)  Non-site-related roadway improvements previously contributed, paid for or committed to by the applicant or his predecessor in interest (including on-site and site-adjacent municipal collectors to the extent such improvements are in excess of or in addition to site-related improvements). 
a.  No credit will be granted pursuant to this subsection unless the costs of the improvements were paid for and the contributions made within the last five (5) years. 
(b)  The credits shall be based on but not limited to the following criteria: 
(1)  The actual cost, or estimated cost of improvements based on recent bid sheet information of the city or Seminole County. 
(c)  Previous development permits wherein voluntary road impact fees were specified and paid shall be binding as to any building permit already issued on land subject to the development permit. Road improvements required by previous development permits shall not be given a credit unless they meet the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above. 
(d)  Any credit issued pursuant to this section shall run with the land on which the credit pertained and may only be transferred by the holder of said credits to any successor in interest in the parcel of land to which the credit pertained. 
(e)  Any agreement for the issuance of credits against any road impact fee assessed pursuant to this division shall be included in an impact agreement as set forth in section 9-386.10. 
(f)  Any petition for the issuance of credits against any road impact fee assessed pursuant to this division shall be submitted to the city manager, or his designee, and must contain: 
(1)  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property; 
(2)  A copy of any impact agreement, credit agreement, or other documentation on which the applicant relies for the claim which may pertain to the issuance of such credits; 
(3)  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed; and 
(4)  Such other information which may be reasonably necessary to ascertain current ownership of the property and the current status of the agreements for credits. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.12. - Vested rights. 
(a)  A developer or successor in interest of land which has received a development permit may petition the city commission for a vested rights determination which would exempt the petitioner from the provisions of this division. Such petition shall be evaluated by the city attorney and a recommendation thereon submitted to the city commission based on the following criteria: 
(1)  There exists a valid, unexpired governmental act of authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought; 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this division; 
(3)  That it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the developer to comply with the requirements of this division. For the purposes of this subsection, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development; 
a.  Whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the fee required by this division; 
b.  Whether the expenses or obligations were made or incurred subsequent to January 22, 1990, after which date the adoption of this division was pending; and 
c.  Whether the operation of this division would create an onerous burden which would prevent the petitioner from making a reasonable return on his investment. 
(b)  The city shall not permit the extension of a building permit beyond the initial time period for activation without the applicant complying with the provisions of this division. 
(c)  If a previously approved development order or other binding agreement contained conditions regarding traffic impacts, road impact fees and their designated uses, or off-site transportation improvements, the developer or his successor may request a modification of such prior approvals in order to bring the approval conditions into consistency with this division. Any such modification of prior approvals and amendments to development orders so accomplished shall not be deemed a substantial deviation under Chapter 380 of Florida Statutes. Any petition for such modification of prior approvals and amendments to development orders under the provisions of this subsection must be filed with the city manager within one (1) year of the effective date of this division. 
(d)  If a previously approved development order or other binding agreement provides for the mitigation of the traffic impacts of said development and if the city manager, or his designee, determines that such traffic impact mitigation measures are substantially consistent with the requirements of this division, then the road impact fee payable for such development under this division shall be revised accordingly to reflect the presumed traffic impact of said development. There shall be a presumption that the traffic impact mitigation provisions of any development order approved more than five (5) years prior to the adoption of this division are not substantially consistent with the requirements of this division. This subsection shall not apply where a development order previously approved provides that at such time as the city adopts transportation impact fee provision, thereafter the provisions and terms of the adopted impact fee provision will apply to the development project. Any petition for such modification of prior approvals and amendments to development orders under the provisions of this subsection must be filed with the city manager within one (1) year of the effective date of this division. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91) 
Sec. 9-386.13. - Site-related road improvements. 
    The road impact fee formula contained in this division is designed to calculate the costs inherent in the construction on non-site-related improvements to the municipal collector road network and is not intended to assess an amount that constitutes an approximation of the costs to construct site-related roadway improvements. Therefore, if an assessment for the construction of site-related roadway improvements is required as a condition of development approval, then to the extent permitted by law, said assessment or construction requirements shall be considered as an addition to the assessment calculated pursuant to the terms of this division. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.14. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from payment of the road impact fee: 
(1)  Those land development activities which have received a building permit prior to the effective date of this division except as provided for in other sections of this division. 
(2)  Alteration or expansion of an existing dwelling unit where no additional units are created or the use is not changed. 
(3)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures, to the extent that there is no increase in trip generation and which will not increase the external trip generation of the principal building, structure or use. 
(4)  The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building, structure, or use with a new building or structure of like size, capacity and use to the extent that there is no increase in trip generation. 
(5)  Publicly owned and operated buildings or structures used for general governmental purposes (to include but not limited to sewer, stormwater, police, fire, ground transportation, solid waste, parks, recreation and cultural purposes). 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.15. - Establishment of a trust fund. 
(a)  The impact fees collected by the city pursuant to this division shall be kept separate from other revenue of the city. 
(b)  Funds withdrawn from the account must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this division. The disbursal of such funds shall require the approval of the city commission, upon recommendation of the city manager and staff. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91) 
Sec. 9-386.16. - Collection of road impact fee assessment. 
(a)  Except as provided for in section 9-386.10 of this division, the road impact fee assessment shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of the building permit for the land development activity generating traffic. 
(b)  The road impact fee shall be collected by the city manager or his designee. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 589, § I, 10-9-95; Ord. No. 638, § IV, 2-10-97; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.17. - Use of funds collected. 
(a)  The funds collected by reason of establishment of the road impact fee in accordance with this division shall be used solely for the purpose of administering, planning, acquisition, expansion and development of non-site-related improvements to the municipal collector road network determined to be needed to serve new development, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Corridor studies and environmental assessments; 
(2)  Design and construction plan preparation; 
(3)  Right-of-way acquisition; 
(4)  Construction of new through lanes; 
(5)  Construction of new turn lanes; 
(6)  Construction of new bridges; 
(7)  Construction of new drainage facilities in conjunction with new roadway construction; 
(8)  Purchase and installation of traffic signalization; 
(9)  Construction of new curbs, medians and shoulders; 
(10)  Construction inspection and testing. 
(b)  All funds shall be used in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in state case and statutory law and otherwise consistent with all requirements of the Constitution of the United States and the State of Florida and all applicable laws. Said funds shall not be used to maintain or repair any roads. 
(c)  Interest on funds. Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts. All income derived shall be deposited in the trust account. 
(d)  The city shall be entitled to retain an amount totaling three (3) percent, not to exceed a total of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), of the aggregate of all impact fees it collects annually pursuant to this division which retained funds shall be utilized to offset the actual administrative costs associated with the collection and use of said funds that year pursuant to this division. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91) 
Sec. 9-386.18. - Return of funds. 
    If it is determined by the city that fee assessments collected pursuant to this division have not been spent or encumbered for expenditure by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six (6) years from the date the fee was received or if the development for which the fees were paid was never begun and the building permit expired, then said funds shall be eligible for refund to the then present property owner in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The then present property owner must petition the city for the refund within one (1) year following the end of the calendar quarter immediately following five (5) years from the date on which the fee was received by the city; 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property or his authorized agent; 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee or other competent evidence of payment. 
c.  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed; 
d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill; and 
e.  A copy of the building permit or development agreement pursuant to which the impact fees were paid; 
f.  Such other information which may be reasonably necessary to ascertain current ownership of the property. 
(3)  Within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of petition for refund; the city manager or his designee shall advise the petitioner and the city commission of the status of the fee requested for refund. For the purpose of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in the trust fund account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of the account when withdrawals have been made. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.19. - Review. 
    This division shall be reviewed by the city commission periodically in order to maintain current local data analysis, rate schedules, and reasonable regulations in compliance with applicable law. The review shall include trip generation rates, trip lengths, construction and right-of-way acquisition rates, trip lengths, construction and right-of-way acquisition costs, division provisions, impact fee rates and other applicable items. The purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of inflation on the actual costs or roadway improvements, to review and revise, if necessary, the transportation improvement program, and to ensure that the fee charged new land development activity generating traffic will not exceed its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of road improvements necessitated solely by its presence. Failure of the city to periodically undertake such a review shall result in the continued use and application of the existing fee schedule and other data. 
(Ord. No. 512, § 1, 12-9-91; Ord. No. 2016-10, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Sec. 9-386.20. - Penalty.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2003-04, § 2, adopted April 28, 2003, amended former Div. 3, §§ 2-391-2-391.12, in its entirety which pertained to police public safety facilities and derived from Ord.

Sec. 9-391. - Generally. 
    The city commission hereby establishes police, fire, and parks and recreation impact fees under the requirements of this division. The city commission finds that the Florida Growth Management Act mandates that local government plan comprehensively for future growth and that this division is consistent with that mandate. In addition, F.S. § 163.3202(3) encourages the use of innovative land development regulations which includes the adoption of "impact fees." Further, new land development activity generates public facility and service demands within the city and it is reasonable to require new development to pay a fair share of the cost of expanding new public facilities and services attributable to new development. This division is enacted pursuant to the Florida Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, F.S. ch. 163, the City of Winter Springs Comprehensive Plan, and other applicable law authorizing a municipality to set rates, fees, and charges for new development. 
(Ord. No. 2003-04, § 2, 4-28-03; Ord. No. 2003-38, § 2, 11-10-03; Ord. No. 2011-13, § 2, 9-26-11) 
Sec. 9-391.1. - Levy and purpose. 
    For the purpose of helping to defray the cost of new or expanded police, fire, and parks and recreation facilities and equipment attributable to new construction within the city limits, impact fees are hereby levied on new construction within the city limits in accordance with the provisions of section 9-391.5, payment of fees, and other provisions of this division. This division is intended to be consistent with the principles for allocating a fair share of the cost of new public facilities to new users as established by the Florida Supreme Court. In support of, and as legal justification for, the impact fees adopted under this division, the city commission hereby adopts by reference the reports prepared by Land Design Innovations, Inc. entitled, "City of Winter Springs Impact Fee Analysis Report for Police, Fire/Rescue and Parks & Recreation," dated November 2002. 
(Ord. No. 2003-04, § 2, 4-28-03; Ord. No. 2003-38, § 2, 11-10-03; Ord. No. 2009-12, § 2, 7-27-09; Ord. No. 2011-13, § 2, 9-26-11)

Before authorizing an expenditure from any one of these trust funds, the city commission shall determine that: 
(1)  Such expenditure is for capital facilities or equipment to be used for the purpose contained in the title of the trust fund from which the expenditure is to be made; and 
(2)  Such expenditure is made necessary by the new construction from which such funds were collected; and 
(3)  Such expenditure shall result in a benefit to the new construction from which said funds were collected.

Sec. 9-391.10. - Vested rights. 
(a)  A developer or successor in interest of land which has received a building permit may petition the city commission for a vested rights determination which would exempt the petitioner from the provisions of this division. Such petition shall be evaluated by the city attorney and a recommendation thereon submitted to the city commission based upon the following criteria: 
(1)  There exists a valid, unexpired government act authorizing a specific development for which a determination is sought; 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this division; 
(3)  That it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the developer to comply with the requirements of this division; 
(4)  Common law principles of equitable estoppel and vested rights set forth in case law. 
(b)  For the purpose of this section, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development: 
(1)  Whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the fee required by this division; 
(2)  With respect to the relevant impact fee, whether the expense or obligations were made or incurred subsequent to November 1, 2002, after which day the adoption of the police, fire, and parks and recreation impact fees required by this division was pending; and 
(3)  Whether the operation of this division would create an inordinate burden which would prevent petitioner from making a reasonable return on his investment. 
(c)  The city shall not permit the extension of a building permit beyond the initial time for activation without the applicant complying with this division. 
(d)  If a previously approved development order or other binding agreement contained conditions regarding impact fees required by this division and their designated uses, or contributions to the capital asset inventory of the respective departments, the developer or his successor may request a modification of such prior approvals in order to bring the approval conditions into consistency with the requirements of this division.

(Ord. No. 2003-04, § 2, 4-28-03)

ARTICLE IX. - VESTED RIGHTS[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Inasmuch as Ord. No. 534, §§ I-IV, adopted Nov. 23, 1992, did not specify manner of codification, such provisions have been designated by the editor as Article IX, substantive sections being §§ 9-401-9-404. 
The comprehensive plan referenced in Article IX is not set out at length herein, however, a copy remains on file and available for inspection at the office of the city clerk. 

Sec. 9-401. - Intent. 
    In recognition of the fact that certain land development rights of property owners may be vested with respect to the City of Winter Springs Comprehensive Plan and the land development regulations adopted to implement the plan (the "LDRs"), including the requirement for the determination of the availability and capacity of public facilities ("concurrency"), it is the intent of this article to provide for a fair and equitable process for the determination of whether a property owner has vested rights against the comprehensive plan and the land development regulations adopted to implement that plan. 
(Ord. No. 534, § I, 11-23-92) 
Sec. 9-402. - Vested rights application process. 
(a)  Application for vested rights special use permit. 
(1)  Any person claiming vested rights to develop property shall make application for a vested rights special use permit pursuant to this article. The owner of the subject property must either sign the application or give written authorization for the applicants to file the application. 
(2)  An application for a vested rights special use permit shall be approved and a vested rights special use permit issued if an applicant meets the requirements set out in this article. Possession of a vested rights special use permit shall enable a permittee to complete the development approved under such permit up to and through issuance of appropriate certificates occupancy, subject to the limitations set forth in section 9-404, and subject to compliance with such laws and regulations against which the development is not vested. 
(3)  Applications for a vested rights special use permit shall be submitted to the city manager on a form to be provided by the city. Such application must be filed within one (1) year after the later of (i) the adoption of this article or (ii) the rezoning of the subject property in order to bring its zoning into conformance with the land use designation assigned to the property by the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map adopted on April 27, 1992 (the "plan adoption date"). Except as provided in subsections (a)(4) and (a)(5), below, failure to file an application within the required period will constitute an abandonment of any claim to vested rights. Judicial relief will not be available unless administrative remedies set forth in this article are exhausted. 
(4)  If a property owner is absent from the state during the entire filing period, and does not have an agent present in the state during such period, such property owner may, with documentation sufficient to indicate a probable lack of notice, be granted leave by the city manager to file an application within one (1) year after the individual's return to Florida. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(3), above, the city commission may, in extraordinary circumstances, allow a property owner to submit an application after the one (1) year deadline where such extension is necessary to avoid undue hardship to the property owner. 
(6)  The city manager, in consultation with the city attorney and city staff, shall review a vested rights special use permit application for sufficiency, and shall request within ten (10) working days from the filing date any additional information necessary to rule on the application. 
(7)  Upon receipt of a complete application, the city manager shall schedule a public hearing before the planning and zoning board, which hearing shall be held not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a complete application, although said hearing may be continued at the request of the applicant or for good cause. Written notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be mailed by the city clerk to all owners of property located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the boundaries of the property for which vested rights are sought, according to the latest certified tax roll. (For purposes of this article, such an owner is deemed a "party of record"). Said notice shall be mailed not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. 
(8)  Within fifteen (15) days after the date the hearing is closed, the planning and zoning board shall render an order to either issue or deny a vested rights special use permit on the application, based on the standards and subject to the limitations established in this article. The order shall be mailed to the applicant and shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall state specifically (i) what rights, if any, are vested; (ii) what laws or regulations those rights are vested against; and (iii) what limitations or requirements apply for the applicant to preserve those vested rights. 
(9)  Individual parcel owners within a larger project may rely on and be governed by a vested rights special use permit covering the overall project. Such an individual parcel owner may also apply for a vested rights determination for his parcel only. If an individual parcel owner receives an independent vested rights special use permit for his parcel, such an individual vested rights special use permit shall establish and govern the vested rights of that parcel, notwithstanding the prior or later approval of a vested rights special use permit for the larger project of which the parcel is a part. A substantial deviation determination under section 9-404(c) and (d) hereof for a parcel governed by such an individual vested rights special use permit shall be based on the proposed changes to the individual parcel. A substantial deviation determination for a vested project encompassing more than one (1) development parcel shall be evaluated based on the proposed changes to the parcels governed by the project's vested rights special use permit, exclusive of any development within parcels governed by an individual vested rights special use permit. 
(b)  Appeals. 
(1)  An applicant or a party of record as defined herein may appeal a decision by the planning and zoning board to the city commission. Such an appeal must be filed with the city clerk within ten (10) days after the date the written order is mailed to the applicant. 
(2)  Upon receipt of an appeal, the city manager shall schedule the matter for consideration by the city commission within sixty (60) days after the appeal is filed. The city clerk shall notify the applicant and any party of record of the date of the commission's hearing by certified mail at least ten (10) days in advance of the hearing. 
(3)  The city commission shall conduct a public hearing on the appeal. Within fifteen (15) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the city shall mail its decision to the applicant in the form of an order incorporating the same elements as the city manager's order described in subsection (a)(8) above. 
(4)  Any appeal of a city commission decision on a vested rights special use permit shall be by petition for certiorari review to the circuit court based solely on the record of the hearing before the city commission. The applicant is responsible for providing a verbatim transcript of the record of that hearing. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the date the city renders its order on the application by mailing said order to the applicant.

(b)  Presumptive vested rights. 
(1)  Developments of regional impact. 
a.  Developments which are authorized under Chapter 380.06, Florida Statutes, pursuant to a valid, unexpired binding letter of vested rights issued by the state land planning agency, including modifications to such binding letter of vested rights (a "binding letter"), shall be entitled to a presumptive vested rights special use permit. The application for a presumptive vested rights special use permit based on a binding letter shall include the binding letter and a letter from the department of community affairs verifying the authenticity of the binding letter and the related plan of development, all of which shall be made exhibits to the permit. Such permit shall recognize the vesting of the development as set forth in the binding letter, and such vesting shall continue until development approved in the binding letter is complete or until the expiration or invalidation of the binding letter, whichever occurs first. 
b.  Development which has been specifically approved in a Chapter 380.06 DRI development order rendered prior to the adoption date, and which remains valid, shall be entitled to a presumptive vested rights special use permit. The DRI development order shall be made an exhibit to the permit, and the permit shall be subject to the terms of, and shall reference the limitations imposed by, the DRI development order. 
c.  Development which has been specifically approved in a court order shall be entitled to a presumptive vested rights special use permit. The court order shall be made an exhibit to the permit, and the permit shall be subject to the terms of, and shall reference the limitations imposed by, the court order. 
(2)  Other developments. 
a.  Possession by a property owner of a valid unexpired final plat or final engineering plans approved by the city shall presumptively vest the development approved if: (i) such plat or plans were approved prior to the plan adoption date; and (ii) physical development pursuant to the plat or plans has commenced and is continuing in good faith. Verification of the above requirements shall be made by the city manager and a written statement of verification shall be included in his order if it approves a presumptive vested rights special use permit in reliance thereon. 
(c)  Common law vested rights. 
(1)  Applicants who do not qualify for a presumptive vested rights special use permit shall be entitled to a common law vested rights special use permit if they can prove the following: 
a.  Prior to the plan adoption date, there was a valid, unexpired act or omission of a government agency upon which the applicant relied; and 
b.  The applicant's reliance was reasonable and in good faith; and 
c.  The applicant, in reliance upon the valid, unexpired act of government, has made a substantial change in position or has incurred extensive obligations or expenses; and 
d.  It would be inequitable, unjust or fundamentally unfair to destroy the rights acquired by the applicant by means of the government's act or omission. 
(2)  The purchase of property in reliance on then existing zoning, without more, shall not vest the purchaser's right to develop in accordance with said zoning. 
(3)  The following are not considered development expenditures or obligations in and of themselves, without more, unless the applicant was unable to obtain further approvals because of extraordinary delays beyond the applicant's control: 
a.  Expenditures for legal and other professional services that are not related to the design or construction of improvements; 
b.  Taxes paid; 
c.  Expenditures for initial acquisition of the land. 
(Ord. No. 534, § III, 11-23-92) 
Sec. 9-404. - Limitations on determination of vested rights. 
(a)  Except where a longer term is stated in the vested rights special use permit, upon the expiration of five (5) years after the issuance of a vested rights special use permit, the issuance of development permits for the property subject to the vested rights special use permit shall be subject to the requirements of the comprehensive plan and implementing land development regulations. A term longer than five (5) years may be approved based on a reasonable schedule for completing the development being vested. The city may impose reasonable conditions on vested rights special use permits, or extensions of same, to ensure that the vested development is continuing in good faith. 
(b)  The applicant or his successor may request an extension of the five-year period, which must be filed not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of said time period. Such a request shall be scheduled for hearing by the city commission within thirty (30) days after it is filed. The city may grant extensions for such additional periods as it deems appropriate to avoid undue hardship to the applicant, provided the applicant has commenced physical development of the property and is continuing in good faith with development of the vested plan, or has been precluded from doing so by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control. For purposes of this article, the phrase "continuing in good faith" shall mean: 
(1)  Receipt by the applicant or his successor of permits or approvals from the city or other governmental entity or agency consistent with the timely and orderly progression toward completion of the vested development; or 
(2)  Other evidence of continued reliance and expenditures by the applicant in pursuit of the completion of the vested development. 
(c)  All development subject to a vested rights special use permit must be consistent with the terms of the development approval(s) upon which the special use permit was based. Any substantial deviation from a prior approval, except a deviation required by governmental action, shall cause the development involved to be subject to the comprehensive plan and implementing land development regulations. The city manager shall determine whether a proposed change is a substantial deviation, which is defined for purposes of this article as follows: 
(1)  Any change to add a new land use or to change the vested mix of land uses that alters the basic character of the vested development; or 
(2)  Any change in density or intensity of use that would increase the development's impacts on those public facilities subject to concurrency by more than five (5) percent; or 
(3)  Any change in access to the project that would increase the development's transportation impacts by more than five (5) percent on any road subject to concurrency unless the access change would result in an overall improvement to the transportation network. 
    A permittee may appeal a substantial deviation determination to the city commission provided such appeal is filed within ten (10) days after the date the written determination is mailed to the permittee. 
(d)  A change that is not a substantial deviation shall not divert vested rights. 
(e)  A vested rights special use permit shall apply to the land and is therefore transferable from owner to owner of the land subject to the permit. 
(f)  Development that is granted a vested rights special use permit shall remain subject to the requirements of the comprehensive plan and implementing land development regulations except to the extent that the application of such requirements would result in the denial of: 
(1)  The vested land uses; 
(2)  The vested density or intensity of development; 
(3)  The vested phasing of development; or 
(4)  Other specifically vested development entitlements approved in the development order or orders on which the vested rights special use permit was based. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a vested rights special use permit may be revoked by the city commission upon a showing by the city that failure to revoke the permit will result in a peril to the health, safety or general welfare of the residents of the city unknown at the time of the permit's approval. The time periods provided for in this article may be waived or amended by the city commission upon a showing of good cause.

ARTICLE X. - CONCURRENCY ADMINISTRATION AND EVALUATION PROCEDURE 
DIVISION 1. - OVERVIEW AND EXEMPTIONS 

Sec. 9-500. - Purpose of concurrency evaluation. 
    The purpose of this article is to implement the concurrency provisions of the city's growth management policies consistent with the provisions of Chapter 163, Part II, Florida Statutes, and applicable administrative rules. It is also the purpose of this article to establish an ongoing concurrency evaluation system which ensures that public facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development and that development orders and permits are issued in a manner that will not result in a reduction in the levels of service below the adopted level of service standards adopted by the city for public facilities and services. The concurrency evaluation system shall measure the potential impact of any proposal for a development permit or order upon the established minimum acceptable levels of service for sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water, parks and recreation, and transportation facilities, unless the development permit or order is exempt from the concurrency review requirements of this article. No development permit or order which contains a specific plan of development, including densities and intensities of development, shall be issued unless adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed development as determined by the concurrency evaluation set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 2001-39, § 1, 9-10-01) 
Sec. 9-501. - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed below unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
    City's growth management policies. The growth management policies of the City of Winter Springs that are set forth in the city's comprehensive plan and land development regulations which regulate land development and established levels of service of public facilities and services, cluding sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water, parks and recreation, and transportation facilities. 
    Concurrency certificate. A certificate issued for a specific development or property that indicates available capacity for each public facility reviewed based upon adopted levels of service standards established in this article at the time the certificate is issued and does not guarantee capacity in the future, nor does the certificate encumber capacity for a specific period of time. 
    Concurrency evaluation. Evaluation by the development review committee based on adopted levels of service standards to ensure that public facilities and services are available concurrent with the impacts of such development as defined in this article. 
    Development order. Any order granting, denying or granting with conditions an application for a development permit. 
    Development permit. Includes any building permit, zoning permit, subdivision approval, rezoning certification, special exception, variance, or any other official action of the city having the effect of permitting the development of land. 
    Development review committee. Shall be a committee established by the city manager to review and approve applications for the development of land. At a minimum, the committee shall consist of the directors of utilities/public works, community development, and parks and recreation or their designee. The city manager or city commission may also appoint residents of Winter Springs to serve on the committee. 
    Financial feasibility means that sufficient revenues are currently available or will be available from committed funding sources for the first three (3) years, or will be available from committed or planned funding sources for years 4 and 5, of the city's 5-year capital improvement program (CIP) for financing capital improvements, such as ad valorem taxes, bonds, state and federal funds, tax revenues, impact fees, and developer contributions, which are adequate to fund the projected costs of the capital improvements identified in the comprehensive plan necessary to ensure that adopted level-of-service standards are achieved and maintained within the period covered by the five-year CIP. 
    Level of service standard. The measurement indicating the degree of service provided by, or proposed for a facility based on operational characteristics of the facility. 
    Proportionate fair share means the method by which the impacts of development on transportation can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors. The intent of the proportionate fair-share contributions is to provide applicants for development an opportunity to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their share of the cost of improving the impacted transportation facility. Proportionate fair share is a pay-and-go method that does not require immediate resolution of the level of service deficiency, but transportation proiects mitigating the LOS deficiencies on these facilities must still be programmed for improvement in the city's 5-year capital improvement program. 
    Public facilities and services. Those public facilities and services for which level of service standards have been established in the City of Winter Springs Growth Management Policies, and are recognized in this article, and which include (1) roads, (2) wastewater, (3) storm water, (4) solid waste, (5) potable water, (6) parks and recreation.

Sec. 9-502. - Application submittal. 
(a)  The development review committee shall be responsible for carrying out the requirements of this article and shall make determinations regarding concurrency applications and issue certificates according to the procedures established by this article. An application for a concurrency certificate shall be filed with all applications for a final development order or permit, unless otherwise exempted by this article. A preliminary review application may also be submitted for an informational and non-binding concurrency review by the development review committee. All applications shall be made on a form prescribed by the city, which should require, at a minimum and as applicable: 
(1)  Date of submittal. 
(2)  Name, address, and telephone number of applicant and property owner. 
(3)  Parcel I.D. number, street address, and legal description. 
(4)  Proposed land use(s) by land category, square feet and number of units. 
(5)  Phasing information by proposed uses, square feet and number of units. 
(6)  Existing use of property, acreage of property, name of DRI, PUD, subdivisions. 
(7)  Site design information. 
(8)  Previously issued concurrency certificates. 
(9)  Possible limitations in the manner in which the proposed use will be conducted, including restrictions on use, resident population, density and intensity of use. 
(10)  Possible limitations on the height, size, location, density or intensity of a building or other structure. 
(11)  Possible phasing schedule. 
(12)  Possible alternative with respect to size, number, location or nature of vehicle access points. 
(13)  Possible increase in the amount of street dedication, roadway width, or construction of roadway improvements within street right of way. 
(14)  Plans for the protection of existing trees, vegetation, water resources, wildlife habitat and other significant natural resources. 
(15)  Any information regarding possible solutions or alternatives which would permit the proposed development in conformity with the requirements and intent of this article and the city's growth management policies. 
(16)  Data and analysis relevant to the concurrency facilities and services evaluated under this article, whereupon the development review committee can conduct and make an informed concurrency determination. 
(b)  An application which is not technically complete shall be returned to the applicant with a correspondence detailing the deficiencies in the application. Failure to submit the required information in accordance with this section shall result in the denial of the concurrency application. Applications deemed complete by the city shall be handled on a first-come first-served basis. Once an application is accepted by the city as complete, any changes in uses, densities and intensities for the subject property that result in an increased capacity requirement for any concurrency facility shall be subject to a new concurrency review. An application fee may be established by the city commission by resolution. All completed applications shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures contained in this article.

Sec. 9-503. - Reserved. 
Sec. 9-504. - Change of use. 
(a)  Any change, redevelopment or modification of use shall require a concurrency evaluation under this article, provided the proposed change, redevelopment or modification of use has more than a de minimis impact on public facilities and services than the previous use that was actively maintained on the site during the six (6) month period prior to the date of application for concurrency evaluation. Concurrency credit shall be given for the previous use that was actively maintained on the site during the six (6) month period prior to the date of application for concurrency evaluation. If the proposed change, redevelopment or modification of use has a lesser impact on public facilities and services than the previous use during the six (6) month period prior to the date of application for concurrency evaluation, then no concurrency evaluation shall be required. If no use existed on the site for the six (6) month period prior to the date of application, no concurrency credit shall be issued and the proposed use shall be subject to concurrency evaluation. 
(b)  The impact of such change, redevelopment or modification shall be measured in terms of level of service criteria including, but not limited to, vehicular trips per day, estimated increases in water and sewer flows, increases in resident population, increases in on-site impervious surfaces, and estimated solid waste generation. 
(c)  The burden is on the applicant to provide reasonably sufficient evidence that the previous use has been actively maintained on the site during the six (6) month period prior to the date of application for the concurrency evaluation. Such evidence may include utility records, records reflecting the use sought to be proven, and other relevant documents. A local business tax receipt is not of itself sufficient proof of a particular use, but may be used to support other evidence of a use maintained on a site.

DIVISION 2. - LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS (LOS) 

Sec. 9-510. - Introduction. 
    The levels of service set forth in this Division 2 are intended to be the minimum levels of service which are acceptable under the city's growth management policies for: (1) potable water; (2) solid waste; (3) wastewater; (4) parks and recreation; (5) storm water; and (6) transportation. The city shall monitor compliance with the minimum levels of service set forth in this division by ensuring that public facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of development, as required by law. 
(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 3, 12-10-01) 
Sec. 9-511. - Potable water LOS (Reserved). 
Sec. 9-512. - Solid waste LOS (Reserved). 
Sec. 9-513. - Wastewater LOS (Reserved). 
Sec. 9-514. - Parks and recreation LOS. 
    A parks and recreation concurrency evaluation shall be required for any residential development on a citywide and per development basis. Citywide minimum levels of service for parklands shall be determine on a two level basis for community parks and neighborhood parks. In addition to the citywide minimum levels of service, new residential development shall supplement the system of neighborhood parks and recreation services by providing parklands (or fees in lieu of) consistent with the level of service criteria and requirements established for parks and recreation under the city's comprehensive plan and this section. 
(1)  The parks and recreation level of service standards for community parks shall be monitored by the city through concurrency evaluations to ensure that the minimum level of service standard for citywide community parks remains at or above one and six-tenths (1.6) acres per one thousand (1,000) population. In performing the concurrency evaluation for community parks for a proposed residential development, the development review committee shall determine the number of acres of community parkland which would be necessary to serve the number of citywide dwelling units existing or approved prior to the development plus the number of proposed new dwelling units. If the development satisfies the level of service standards for community parkland, then the development shall be deemed concurrent for community parks and a certificate shall be issued consistent with section 9-533 of this article. If a residential development causes or continues to cause the level of service for community parks to be not concurrent, the developer shall pay the city a fair share community parks and recreation impact fee, as established by the city commission by resolution. All such fees collected shall be allocated and appropriated to the city's recreation budget to be expended to enhance the city's community parks system with priority given to expend such funds to acquire parkland. 
(2)  The parks and recreation level of service standards for neighborhood parks shall be based on the application of the level of service standards established for each residential development by particular region of the city as follows: 
Northwest Region - 5.9 acres per 1,000 population 
South-Central Region -5.3 acres per 1,000 population 
Southeast Region -6.9 acres per 1,000 population 
In performing the concurrency evaluation for neighborhood parks and recreation for a proposed residential development, the development review committee shall determine the number of acres of parkland which would be necessary to serve the number of dwelling units on-site (minimum one-half (.5) acre). If such amount of parkland can be provided while meeting the level of service standards set forth in this section, then the development shall be deemed concurrent for parks and recreation. If such amount of parkland can not be provided while meeting the level of service standards set forth in this section, then the development shall be deemed not concurrent for parks and recreation and a certificate shall not be issued. However, if a development can not provide the required on-site parkland, the development review committee shall permit the developer to satisfy the parks and recreation standard by providing a combination of on-site and off-site parkland and a fair share neighborhood parks and recreation impact fee as established by the city commission by resolution. In such cases, the development review committee shall require on-site parkland to the maximum extent feasible and practicable, off-site parkland shall be located in the same region as the proposed development, and said impact fee shall only be paid if on and off site parkland can not be provided as required herein. Any and all such fees collected shall be allocated and appropriated to the city's recreation budget to be expended for public recreational purposes and priority shall be given to expend such funds to acquire parkland. At such time the development satisfies the level of service for parks and recreation, a certificate shall be issued consistent with section 9-533 of this article, with the condition that the necessary parkland and recreational services (including any impact fees) shall be in place or paid when the impacts of the development occur or shall be guaranteed to be in place through an enforceable development order or agreement not more than one (1) year after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent. 
(3)  For purposes of determining levels of service for parks and recreation facilities within the city under this section, the term "parkland" shall mean a public or private use of land that is dedicated or exclusively set aside as a neighborhood or community recreational area including, but not limited to, a playground, playing field, swimming pool, tennis court, fishing hole or pier, nature trail, landscaped city square or green for the pursuit of leisure activities, stadium, conservation area suitable for passive recreation, water sport area, or other similar type areas suitable for bona fide recreational activities. A storm water retention pond shall not be considered parkland unless the retention pond includes uplands suitable for bona fide recreational activities or incorporated by design into a bona fide recreational area (e.g., a place to install a water fountain and littoral plantings in a park like setting). If a storm water retention pond is used for parkland purposes, the pond shall include abutting uplands for park purposes at least equal to the size of the pond and the pond shall not be fenced and shall be designed in a safe manner to protect the public (e.g., gradual pond slopes). All parkland required by this article shall be a minimum of one-half (.5) acre and have a minimum width and length of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet unless a lesser width or length is approved by the city commission by variance. When considering a variance, the city commission shall consider whether the requested size and dimensions of the park will provide a functional recreational area in light of the recreational amenities proposed, the recreational demands of the residential community that the recreational area is intended to serve, and the compatibility of the recreational area with the surrounding neighborhood. 
(4)  For purposes of complying with the concurrency requirements of this section, properties zoned Town Center on June 1, 2000 shall satisfy concurrency by providing the parkland required by the Town Center Zoning Code and applicable development agreements.

    The development review committee shall review each completed application for a concurrency certificate or preliminary review and determine, as soon as practicable, whether the application is sufficient. 
(Ord. No. 2001-39, § 1, 9-10-01) 
Sec. 9-531. - Concurrency review. 
    No application shall be deemed sufficient unless it contains all information which, in the professional judgment of the development review committee, is reasonably necessary to evaluate the impacts of the proposed development on the public facilities and services subject to review under this article. During the review process, the development review committee shall either deny, approve, or approve with conditions, the application for a concurrency certificate. 
(Ord. No. 2001-39, § 1, 9-10-01) 
Sec. 9-532. - Conditional approvals. 
(a)  If the development review committee determines that the application can be approved with conditions, the development review committee shall recommend to the city commission a written concurrency agreement. The applicant may accept the conditional approval by written concurrency agreement approved by the city commission, or the applicant may consider the application denied, in which case the applicant may appeal the denial to the city commission. When the development review committee recommends and the city commission approves any conditional concurrency agreement, the city commission, with the recommendation of the development review committee, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the intent and provisions of this article, including any of the following: 
(1)  Limit the manner in which the use is conducted, including restricting density and intensity of the use. 
(2)  Limit the height, size, location, density or intensity of a building or other structure. 
(3)  Require phasing of the project. 
(4)  Designate the size, number, location or nature of vehicle access points. 
(5)  Increase the amount of street dedication, roadway width, or require construction of road improvements within the street right-of-way. 
(6)  Protecting existing trees, vegetation, water resources, wildlife habitat or other significant natural resources. 
(7)  Specify other conditions to permit development in the city in conformity with the intent and purpose of this article and the adopted city growth management policies. 
(b)  All conditional approvals shall be incorporated in a written development agreement which shall be subject to city commission approval.

(a)  A concurrency certificate is a "snap shot" of available capacity for each public facility, evaluated under this article, at the time the certificate is issued. The concurrency certificate does not guarantee capacity in the future or encumber or vest capacity for any period of time. At a minimum, the concurrency certificate shall contain: 
(1)  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and property owner. 
(2)  Parcel I.D. number and legal description. 
(3)  Date of issuance. 
(4)  Proposed use(s) by land use category, square feet, and number of units. 
(5)  Phasing information by proposed uses, square feet, and number of units, if applicable. 
(6)  Total current available capacity within service area(s). 
(7)  Project impact based on LOS standards. 
(b)  A concurrency certificate shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the applicant commences construction of the development under a validly issued building permit. A one (1) year extension may be granted by the development review committee provided circumstances have not adversely diminished the capacity of public facilities and services to support the development. The development shall be subject to a new concurrency evaluation.

DIVISION 5. - TRANSPORTATION FACILITY PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE MITIGATION PROGRAM[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, adopted Nov. 27, 2006, added provisions to the Code designated as §§ 9-561-9-570. In order to avoid conflicts in section numbering the editor has redesignated the provisions of said ordinance as herein set out. 

Sec. 9-546. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as "the Proportionate Fair-Share Program" as required by and in the manner consistent with section 163.3180(16), Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-547. - Applicability. 
    The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city's concurrency management system ("CMS"), including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of section 9-548. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under section 163.3180(12), Florida Statutes, or to developments that may be exempted from concurrency as provided in the City Code, Comprehensive Plan or any other applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-548. - General requirements. 
(a)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(2)  The city five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) includes transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development, as determined by the city. 
(b)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS, but is not contained in the CIP, where one of the following apply: 
(1)  The city adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year CIP no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to section 163.3180(16)(b)1, Florida Statutes, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this division. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten (10) years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
(2)  If the funds allocated for the five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year CIP at the next annual update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways and those of the FDOT for the state highway system. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-549. - Intergovernmental coordination. 
    Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element of the city's comprehensive plan and applicable policies of other agencies, municipalities, and counties, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-550. - Application process. 
(a)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of section 9-548. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system, then the FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(c)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee as established by resolution of the city commission and which includes the following: 
(1)  Name, address and phone number of property owner(s), developer and agent; 
(2)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(3)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(4)  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
(5)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(6)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
(7)  Copy of concurrency application. 
(d)  The city shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within ten (10) business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in section 9-548 then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten (10) business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The city commission may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed sixty (60) days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(e)  Pursuant to section 163.3180(16)(e), Florida Statutes, proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the Strategic Intermodal System requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(f)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a strategic intermodal system facility, no later than sixty (60) days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than fourteen (14) days prior to the city commission meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(g)  The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the commission meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-551. - Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and/or construction and contribution of facilities. 
(b)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(c)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be, as provided for in section 163.3180(12), Florida Statutes, as follows: The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, or 
Proportionate Fair-Share = + [(Development Trips;sub \sub;) / (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub; 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS: 
SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per section E: 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(d)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the projected future cost of the improvement as obtained from the Capital Improvements Program, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT Work Program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted to address inflation; or 
(2)  The most recent issue of FDOT Transportation Costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT Work Program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT District. 
(e)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(f)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a signed and sealed survey and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also payor provide mitigation of the difference. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-552. - Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the city's impact fee regulations as set forth in Article VIII of Chapter 9 of the City Code ("impact fee regulations"). 
(b)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per the city's impact fee regulations. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the impact fee regulations. 
(c)  Major projects not included within the impact fee regulations or created under section 9-563(b)(1) and (2) which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the city's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(d)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-553. - Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(a)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within twelve (12) months then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(b)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 9-551 and adjusted accordingly. 
(c)  All developer improvements authorized under this article must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(d)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(e)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(f)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be non-refundable. 
(g)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-554. - Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city's CIP, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the city commission, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP. 
(b)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 9-563(b)(2). 
Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in section 339.155, Florida Statutes, then the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city commission through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(c)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under section 9-566, the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city. 
(2)  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
(3)  The city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 2006-20, § 2, 11-27-06) 
Sec. 9-555. - Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(a)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the city may enter an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(b)  A development application submitted to the city subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section: 
(1)  All or part of the proposed development is located within one (1) mile of the area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of an adjacent local government; and 
(2)  Using its own concurrency analysis procedures, the city concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five (5) percent or more of the adopted peak hour LOS maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government ("impacted regional facility"); and 
(3)  The impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard. adopted by the adjacent local government, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(c)  Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsection (b)(1)-(3) of this section, the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
(1)  The adjacent local government shall have up to ninety (90) days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of section 163.3180(16), Florida Statutes. Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this section, then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city. 
(2)  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the city, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied. The city may require the adjacent local government to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant.

ARTICLE XI. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 9-561. - Intent; rules of interpretation; building and fire codes; definitions. 
(a)  Intent. This article is intended to permit the continuation of those lots, structures, uses, characteristics of use, or combinations thereof, which were lawful before the passage of the City Code or which at one time had been lawfully permitted under the City Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of the current City Code or future amendments thereto. This article is designed to provide standards and guidelines for the control and management of nonconforming uses and non-complying buildings and structures, especially in regulating changes in the use of land or in the buildings or structures, including quality, volume or intensity, location, ownership or tenancy, accessory and incidental uses, extension, enlargement, replacement, or any other change in characteristic. 
It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities and non-compliances to continue until they are removed through discontinuance, abandonment or amortization, but not to encourage their continuation unless otherwise authorized under this article either expressly or by special permit. Such nonconforming uses and structures are declared by this article to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning districts involved unless the city commission issues a special permit based upon evidence that special circumstances exist in accordance with the standards set forth in this article. It is further the intent of this article that nonconforming uses and structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, increased or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district unless otherwise provided by special permit under this article. 
(b)  Rules for interpretation. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as authorization for or approval of the continuation of any illegal use of a building, structure or land or illegal structure or building that was in violation of any ordinance in effect at the time of the passage of this article or any amendments thereto. The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land, building or structure or construction of an unlawful structure shall not be a basis to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or structure. A lawful building permit issued for any building or structure prior to the enactment of this article, the construction of which is in conformity with approved site plans, if applicable, and building plans shall not be affected by this article if the building or structure is built in full compliance with the City Code as it existed at the time of the issuance of the building permit. In the event there is a conflict with the provisions of this article and a specific amortization provision requiring the removal or modification of a nonconforming structure or discontinuance of a nonconforming use of land, the provision which requires the nonconformity to come into compliance with the current City Code the earliest shall apply. 
(c)  Building and fire codes. No provision contained in this article, or elsewhere in the City Code, shall nullify, void, abrogate or supercede any requirement contained in a building or fire code that is duly enacted by law. 
(d)  Definitions. As used in this article, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
(1)  Lot of record shall mean a lot which is part of a subdivision recorded in the official record books of Seminole County, Florida, or a parcel of land described by metes and bounds legal description, the description of which has been recorded in the official record books of Seminole County, Florida, and complies with the subdivision of land regulations of the city. 
(2)  Nonconforming or nonconformity shall mean any lot, structure, use of land or structure, or characteristic of any use or structure which was lawful at the time of subdivision, construction, or commencement, as the case may be, which over time no longer complies with the City Code or other applicable law due to a subsequent change of the City Code or other law. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-562. - Continuance of lawful nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  Continuance of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of the City Code or any subsequent amendment thereto may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the adoption or subsequent amendment of the City Code; unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located; 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the adoption or subsequent amendment of the City Code; 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by the City Code for the zoning district in which such land is located; and 
(4)  No additional structures which do not conform to the requirements of the City Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(b)  Continuance of nonconforming structures. The lawful use of a nonconforming structure may be continued subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; 
(2)  Any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; 
(3)  Should such structure be damaged by any means, such that the cost of repair or reconstruction exceeds sixty (60) percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of damage, it shall not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of the City Code; and 
(4)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved. 
Notwithstanding any of the above, upon any nonconforming lot of record as described in this article, that is improved with a single-family dwelling as of the date of the adoption of the City Code or lawfully permitted under the City Code, a single-family dwelling may be rebuilt within the original footprint of the dwelling structure existing as of the date of the adoption of the City Code or subsequent amendment, without regard to area, width, yard, or setback requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-563. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the City Code, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot of record. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the zoning districts, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variances of yard dimensions other than area or width, or both, shall be obtained only through action of the city commission. 
(b)  If two (2) or more lots of record with continuous frontage are under single ownership, and all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by the City Code, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of development and this article. No portion of said parcel shall hereafter be created and used as a separate parcel or sold or otherwise subdivided which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by the City Code unless all or part of the parcel is sold in order to create a lot meeting the requirements of the City Code. Notwithstanding this aggregation of land requirement, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any such single lot of record in a residential zoning district provided the land density requirements of the comprehensive plan are satisfied and the proposed single-family dwelling and any customary accessory building are compatible to the surrounding neighborhood with respect to property values and building size. For purposes of this paragraph, compatible shall mean substantially similar to or exceeds the property values and building size of other single-family dwellings and customary accessory buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-564. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
    If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the adoption or subsequent amendment of the City Code, that would not be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of the City Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by the City Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the district in which it is located; 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this article but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
(3)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; and 
(4)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purposes of this subsection shall mean damage by any means, such that the cost to repair or reconstruct the structure exceeds sixty (60) percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of damage. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-565. - Abandonment. 
(a)  A nonconforming use of a building or premises which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned: 
(1)  When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent; or 
(2)  When the characteristic equipment and the furnishings of the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar equipment within one hundred eighty (180) days, unless other facts show intention to resume the nonconforming use; or 
(3)  When it has been replaced by a conforming use; or 
(4)  Where the use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or for eighteen (18) months (545 days) during any three-year period. 
(b)  In the event a more specific abandonment, discontinuance, or amortization provision is stated elsewhere in this City Code for a specific nonconforming structure, land use, or land area, the abandonment, discontinuance, and amortization provision which requires the nonconformity to come into compliance with the current City Code the earliest shall apply. 
(c)  No provision contained in this article, or elsewhere in the City Code regarding the abandonment, discontinuance, or amortization of nonconforming structures or land uses shall nullify, void, or abrogate any similar provision contained in a duly executed binding development agreement approved by the City Commission. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-566. - Repairs and maintenance. 
(a)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of nonconforming structures are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, repair, or replacement work on nonconforming structures shall be authorized by the city commission pursuant to section 9-568 or by building permit provided the following conditions are satisfied: 
(1)  The renovation, repair, or replacement work complies with applicable building codes. 
(2)  No violation of sections 9-562, 9-564, 9-565 exists. 
(3)  The permittee shall comply to the extent reasonably possible with all other applicable provisions of this article. 
(4)  There are no pending code enforcement actions or liens existing on the subject property. 
(5)  The cost of any renovation, repair, or replacement work on the structure in any twelve (12) month period does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time that the work is performed. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. However, this subsection shall not be construed as a means of circumventing the intent of this article calling for the elimination of nonconforming structures by allowing a nonconforming structure to be substantially rebuilt so as to extend the ordinary and natural life of a nonconforming structure. 
(c)  This section does not apply to structures used for single-family purposes which structures may be renovated, repaired, or replaced in accordance with a lawfully issued building permit. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-567. - Temporary uses. 
    The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or structures, or construction of an unlawful structure, shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or structure. Such use or structure shall not be validated by the adoption of this article or amendments hereto unless it complies with the terms of the City Code. 
(Ord. No. 2003-36, § 2, 10-13-03) 
Sec. 9-568. - Special permit. 
(a)  The intent and purpose of this section is to recognize that there are limited and special circumstances where overall community and public policy objectives of the city encourage, and shall be served by, the continuation of some nonconforming uses and structures provided said uses and structures are not detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood and to the community values established in the city's comprehensive plan and city codes. The city commission desires to establish specific standards for this category of special permit in order to allow the continuation of some nonconforming uses and structures notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this article or City Code. 
(b)  The city commission at a duly held public hearing may grant a special permit to allow the continuation of a nonconforming use or structure provided the following terms and conditions are strictly satisfied: 
(1)  The owner of the property on which the nonconforming use or structure exists files a special permit application provided by the city; and 
(2)  The applicant demonstrates that the continuation of the nonconforming use or structure: 
a.  Is capable of contributing in a positive way to the character and serves the need of the community including re-occupancy for the accommodation of neighborhood walk-to-service uses, walk-to-work opportunities, and live-work spaces; reuse of buildings with architectural or historic value; and reuse of buildings that generate a significant economic benefit to the community; and 
b.  Is compatible with, and not detrimental to, the surrounding neighborhood in terms of traffic, noise, parking, odor, light, intensity and land uses, hours of operation, landscaping, aesthetics, structural design, and density; and 
c.  Is consistent with the community values, objectives, and policies established in the city's comprehensive plan and City Code. 
(c)  The city commission may impose conditions and safeguards as a condition of approval of any special permit granted under this section.

ARTICLE XII. - MINIMUM COMMUNITY APPEARANCE AND AESTHETIC REVIEW STANDARDS 

Sec. 9-600. - Statement of findings and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Winter Springs has evolved into a unique family-oriented community with extraordinary cultural character and beauty. Indicative of Winter Springs' uniqueness is its reputation as primarily a residential community with beautiful mature trees, award-winning parks, scenic lakefront vistas, and innovative development projects such as the Tuscawilla PUD, Village Walk, Cross-Seminole Trail, and the Towne Center-within close proximity to several internationally-renowned tourist destinations including Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Kennedy Space Center and several major cruise ship terminals. 
(b)  In recognition of Winter Springs' uniqueness, the city commission has determined that a deliberate and conscientious effort must be made by community leaders, in partnership with architects, planners, realtors, builders, and the citizenry of Winter Springs, to protect the general welfare of the community by preserving and improving Winter Springs' aesthetic appearance, beauty, and character-so as to ultimately enhance the quality of life and civic pride of all people who reside, work, vacation, or spend time in Winter Springs. 
(c)  The facilitator of this effort shall be the city commission, whose primary purpose shall be to encourage creative, effective, and flexible architectural standards and cohesive community development consistent with the intent and purpose of this article. 
(d)  The cultural character and beauty of Winter Springs involves, among other things, the aesthetic quality of all one sees in moving about the entire community. Consequently, the ultimate designers and developers of buildings and structures must be informed of the larger context in which their particular works will be viewed within the community. The task of the city commission shall be to provide a mechanism by which proposed new development and modifications or rehabilitations of buildings and structures can be reviewed and approved, in a uniform manner, so as to be in harmony with the comprehensive architecturally related policies, objectives and standards adopted by Winter Springs for the overall betterment of the community. 
(e)  It is recognized by the Florida Supreme Court that zoning solely for aesthetic purposes is not outside the scope of the police power of municipal governments-like Winter Springs. It has also been judicially recognized in Florida (and in other jurisdictions) that the promotion of aesthetic beauty also protects property values, tourism, and other economic interests which Winter Springs deems vital to the community. 
(f)  Zoning is the single most powerful legal enforcement of an overall urban concept, but alone it does not create beauty, aesthetic order, or amenity. The task of the city commission shall be to preserve various elements of urban beauty and require that new and redevelopment projects being developed enhance existing development and the landscape of the community. 
(g)  The essential foundation of beauty in communities is harmony. The plan for achieving beauty must grow out of special local characteristics of site, development and redevelopment potential. Some local areas of natural beauty are Lake Jesup, city parks, Cross-Seminole Trail, and conservation areas designated in the city's comprehensive plan. The vistas and visual delight of these should only be enhanced. 
(h)  It is the intent and purpose of this article to apply to all new commercial, industrial, institutional, multi-family, and residential subdivision development projects and major alterations thereto. It is not intended to apply to individual single-family residences, except as specified in section 9-607. 
(Ord. No. 2003-43, § 2, 1-26-04; Ord. No. 2007-21, § 2, 7-9-07) 
Sec. 9-601. - Approval prerequisite for permits. 
(a)  Except as provided in subparagraph (b) of this section, all new building elevations and accessory structures, and proposed permanent signs for buildings or structures, or major alterations thereto, shall be approved by the city commission before a permit is issued for any such building, structure, or sign, which has an exterior visual impact or effect on the community. 
(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the city manager determines that a building permit application is minor or insignificant, the city manager may grant the permit without submitting the application to the city commission for approval, providing the permit is consistent with the intent and purpose of this article. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "minor or insignificant" shall mean a small scale renovation or modification project affecting a small site and having a nominal exterior visual impact and effect on the community. Any party or person adversely affected by a decision made by the city manager may appeal said decision to the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2003-43, § 2, 1-26-04) 
Sec. 9-602. - Minimum standards; compliance with other code provisions. 
    The requirements of this article shall be considered minimum standards. Further, they shall be deemed supplemental of, and in addition to, all other applicable codes adopted by the city including, but not limited to, the Land Development Regulations, and all fire and building regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2003-43, § 2, 1-26-04) 
Sec. 9-603. - Procedure. 
(a)  Submission of application. As part of the site plan or subdivision review process, or upon separate application created by the city manager, all applicants for development approval subject to the provisions of this article shall submit to the city manager or his designee the application and documents prescribed in section 9-605. 
(b)  Scheduling and notice of hearing. Upon receipt of the required documents, the city manager shall forthwith schedule a hearing on the application before the city commission. Said hearing shall run concurrently with the site plan or subdivision review process to the extent feasible and practicable. Public notice of the time and place of the public meeting shall be posted at places within the city deemed reasonably appropriate for providing such notice.

City of Casselberry, 10 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 408a; and matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this Ordinance and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; and the experiences of other neighboring communities including the City of Casselberry, the city commission finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(4)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States - 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992. 
(8)  As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Florida. 
(9)  From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing positive for the HIV antibody with AIDs symptoms has risen to 73,217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains in a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990. 
(12)  The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(16)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (15) and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(24)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printer material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
(25)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where adult entertainment and sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(26)  Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central Florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
(27)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit central Florida attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes. 
(28)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(29)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(30)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(31)  In order to reverse urban blight, the City of Winter Springs participates in an established community redevelopment area pursuant to Chapter 163, Florida Statutes along the SR 17-92 corridor. Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments that contribute to urban blight operate at cross-purposes with Community Redevelopment Areas. 
(32)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
(33)  Physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(34)  In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. 
(35)  The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(36)  Requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments. 
(37)  Prohibiting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses. 
(38)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(39)  Workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of Chapter 796 of the Florida Statutes, operation without occupational licenses and illegal and unlicensed massage. 
(40)  Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases. 
(41)  The practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(42)  Sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community. 
(43)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(44)  This article shall not be construed as opting the City of Winter Springs out of the Seminole County Public Decency ordinance. 
(45)  The general welfare, health, good order, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

(5)  The authorization in this section for towing of abandoned and disabled vehicles shall not be construed so as to negate the authority of the code enforcement board or special magistrate to hear and adjudicate appropriate cases. 
(f)  Vehicle on public property. Not withstanding any of the foregoing, all vehicles which are located on public property shall be towed and disposed of in accordance with notice and sale requirements of Florida Statute 705, as revised in the 1987 legislative session. To the extent that this section 12-53 conflicts with any portion of Florida Statute 705, the latter shall control as to any vehicles located on public property.

In addition, if the owner of the vehicle raises as a defense at the hearing that the vehicle was stolen at the time it became subject to impoundment, the owner must establish by preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was stolen and that the owner must have formally reported the vehicle as stolen to a law enforcement agency. 
(3)  The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but hearsay and circumstantial evidence is admissible.

The owner of the motor vehicle shall have the right to be represented by counsel and the police chief or is designee may be represented by the city attorney.

If the owner, agent or authorized representative has already posted a bond, certified check or money order for the immediate release of his/her vehicle, the bond, certified check or money order shall be refunded to the owner, agent or authorized representative. 
(6)  If the owner of the motor vehicle or his/her agent or authorized representative fails to attend the hearing, and the special magistrate finds that the city has complied with the notice procedures set forth herein, then such failure shall constitute a waiver of the owner's right to a hearing, and the special magistrate shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the city for an administrative civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00), plus final hearing costs of fifty dollars ($50.00), if applicable, and requiring the continued impoundment of the vehicle if the vehicle has not already been retrieved by the owner.

(i)  Recording liens; settlements. 
(1)  A certified copy of an order of the special magistrate imposing an administrative civil penalty and hearing costs may be recorded in the public records of any county. Upon recording, the order shall constitute a lien against any real or personal property owned by the owner of the motor vehicle. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the real or personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. The city attorney or designee is authorized to foreclose any lien established hereby in the same manner as is provided by law for the foreclosure of other municipal liens or alternatively, as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages. No lien created pursuant to this chapter may be foreclosed on real property which is homesteaded under § 4, art. X of the state constitution. In an action to enforce an order or to foreclose on a lien as provided in this section, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, that it incurs thereby. 
(2)  The city manager, in consultation with the police chief and city attorney is hereby authorized to enter into settlement agreements as may be appropriate to accomplish the objectives of this section. In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit the city from releasing a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of this section, if such release is determined to be in the best interests of the city. 
(j)  Administrative civil penalty; payment. If an administrative civil penalty and hearing fee are imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty and fees shall constitute a debt due and owing the city and shall be independent of the city's return or release of the vehicle. If a cash bond, certified check or money order has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond, certified check or money order shall be applied toward payment of the penalty and hearing fee, if applicable.

(Code 1974, § 7-2) 
Sec. 13-4. - Procedure for city enforcement of non-imminent hazards. 
    In cases involving nuisance or hazardous conditions which require direct governmental action to abate a serious and continuing danger to the public or occupants, including attractive nuisance cases, and where the property owner or tenant fails to heed the notices and enforcement efforts made by the city pursuant to Chapter 13, Article I, but where the emergency nature of the dangers to the public is not so extreme as to warrant dispensing without notice to the property owner(s), then the city enforcement officials shall proceed to: 
(1)  Give notice, which may be combined with notice from the code enforcement board or special magistrate statement of violation and notice of hearing, which informs the property owner that an order will be sought from the code enforcement board or special magistrate for city work or contracted work to repair or secure the property. The notice will prominently inform the property owner that failure to repair the property or follow the code enforcement board's or special magistrate orders may result in city work which shall be charged as a lien against the property. The notice will describe the conditions found by the enforcement officer to constitute a hazard or nuisance. The notice will generally inform the property owner of the work or repairs to be done which will correct the nuisance or hazardous condition(s). 
(2)  If the owner still fails to cure the condition(s) by the time set for hearing pursuant to the above-detailed notice, then the enforcement officer shall submit proof at the hearing concerning the degree of danger of the condition(s) to the public and the property owner's inability or unwillingness to cure such dangers, thus necessitating public action to repair or secure property. The code enforcement board or special magistrate may render its order requiring the city to perform such work as is necessary to secure the property or to render it safe. 
(3)  The enforcement officer shall take such action as has been authorized by the code enforcement board or special magistrate to secure the property or render it safe, including the letting of contracts, pursuant to city purchasing requirements, to repair or remove dangerous conditions and items. The costs and expenses of such work shall be a lien upon the property, which lien may be enforced by suit at law or upon proceeding in chancery. 
(4)  Liens for such city contracted work shall be co-equal with all state, county and municipal taxes and shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims until paid. 
(5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require city work to be done or to imply a duty by the city to fix conditions which are the legal responsibility of the owner(s) of the property. This section is supplementary to city and code enforcement board or special magistrate authority to order the property owner to remedy nuisance conditions.

Sec. 13-75. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  Any employee, officer or resident of the City of Winter Springs may file, in accordance with this section, a complaint alleging that a place or premises constitutes a public nuisance, as defined herein. Such complaint shall only be for those nuisances enumerated above in section 13-74(c) and shall state facts that reasonably tend to establish the existence of such public nuisance. 
(b)  All complaints shall be filed with the nuisance abatement coordinator. The nuisance abatement coordinator shall review each complaint filed to determine whether the facts presented establish the requisite number of incidents or occurrences required under section 13-74 above. Where the complaint alleges the requisite number of incidents or occurrences to establish a nuisance under this article, the nuisance abatement coordinator shall forward the complaint, with any relevant incident or arrest reports generated by the police department substantiating such incidents or occurrences or evidencing new or additional incidents or occurrences, to the city attorney. 
(c)  The city attorney shall review all complaints received from the nuisance abatement coordinator for legal sufficiency. If the city attorney deems the complaint sufficient under the code to support a probable finding of the existence of a public nuisance, the nuisance abatement coordinator shall prepare a courtesy notice of violation to be served, in accordance with this section, upon the owner of the property in question. The courtesy notice of violation shall provide the name of the owner of the premises, the address of the premises where the nuisance has occurred, a brief statement describing the incidents or occurrences which support the finding of a public nuisance upon the premises, and recommendations of remedial action to be taken to abate the public nuisance upon the property. The owner of the premises shall have ten (10) days from the date of the notice to contact the nuisance abatement coordinator to indicate what action will be taken to abate the nuisance upon the premises. Failure of the owner to receive this notice of violation shall not invalidate any further proceedings hereunder. 
If a recurring public nuisance or emergency situation exists, the nuisance abatement coordinator shall not be required to provide a courtesy notice of violation, but instead the city attorney may immediately prepare and serve a statement of violation and notice of hearing as provided below. 
(d)  Should the owner or operator fail to contact the nuisance abatement coordinator, fail to commit to a course of action designed to abate the nuisance upon the property, or should there be any further incidents or occurrences which constitute a nuisance upon the property, a hearing shall be scheduled before the board. Such hearing shall be held no sooner than ten (10) days after the notice of hearing is sent to the owner of the place or premises at his or her last known address. The nuisance abatement coordinator or city attorney shall then prepare and serve upon the owner or operator, in accordance with this article, a statement of violation/notice of hearing providing the following information: 
(1)  A statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing; 
(2)  A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held; 
(3)  A reference to the particular sections of the statutes and ordinances involved; and 
(4)  A copy of the statement of violation, including all documentation in support thereof. 
(e)  All notices under this article shall be hand-delivered by the police department where practical or where not practical or impossible by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner of record at the address as it appears in the public records of the seminole county property appraiser's office. If the notice is returned for any reason, then service shall be effected by mailing the notice through regular delivery to the address of the premises and by posting the notice in accordance with Chapter 162, Florida Statutes. Proof of service shall be by written declaration indicating the date, time, and manner in which service was made. 
(f)  The city attorney may negotiate stipulated settlement agreements with a property owner to facilitate the abatement of a public nuisance. All stipulated agreements shall be reviewed and approved by the nuisance abatement coordinator and the board prior to being effective. 
(g)  At the hearing, the nuisance abatement coordinator and/or city attorney shall present evidence before the board on behalf of the city and has the burden to prove the existence of a public nuisance by substantial and competent evidence. The board may consider any evidence, regarding the activities alleged in the statement of violation and occurring about the place or premises, and the owner(s) of the place or premises shall have the opportunity to appear before the board, in person and/or through legal counsel, to present evidence in defense or in mitigation against the complaint, conduct cross-examination, submit rebuttal evidence, and make brief opening and/or closing statements. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitive evidence shall be excluded. All testimony shall be taken under oath and shall be recorded. Any member of the board, or counsel to the board, may inquire of any witness testifying before the board. The board shall take testimony of such witnesses as may be called by the respective sides. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern said proceedings. In addition to all other relevant evidence, the board may also consider testimony and evidence relating to the general reputation of the place or premises. 
The board may proceed with a hearing in absentia on the merits of an alleged public nuisance against any alleged violator of this article who has been properly noticed under this article and has failed to appear. Any findings or order entered by the board are valid and binding upon each such violator who has been properly noticed. 
The board in its discretion may continue a hearing to receive additional evidence, testimony, or for any other reason the board deems appropriate. 
(h)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall issue findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted by Florida Statutes and by this article. The order shall generally be stated orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed to the alleged violator within ten (10) days after the hearing. 
(i)  If the board declares a place or premises to be a public nuisance, it may enter an order immediately prohibiting: 
(1)  The maintaining of the nuisance; 
(2)  The operating or maintaining of the place or premises, including the closure of the place or premises or any part thereof; or 
(3)  The conduct, operation, or maintenance of any business or activity on the premises which is conducive to such nuisance. 
The board shall be authorized to take such other measures or to impose conditions that the board deems appropriate to abate a public nuisance, provided such conditions and measures are consistent with this article. 
(j)  If the city proves the existence of a public nuisance or recurring public nuisance before the board, the city, as the prevailing party, shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs associated with the investigation, hearing and prosecution on the public nuisance through all appellate proceedings, including the costs of recording any order, notice or agreement. 
(k)  An order of the board shall expire not more than one (1) year or as otherwise designated in the order after entry of the order by the board. The order may include deadlines or other notice for requiring compliance by a certain date and that a fine may be imposed in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 2003-33, § 2, 9-8-03) 
Sec. 13-76. - Penalties; fines; liens; recording. 
(a)  Upon evidence of noncompliance of any board order, the city attorney or nuisance abatement coordinator shall request a hearing before the board. Upon evidence establishing that a noncompliance exists, the board shall enter an order imposing conditions and any other measures to abate the public nuisance as provided by this article, including the imposition of a fine. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first occurrence of a public nuisance and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a recurring public nuisance. However, total fines imposed in any action brought pursuant to this article shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the nuisance abatement board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the public nuisance; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the owner to correct the public nuisance; and 
(3)  Any previous nuisances maintained or permitted by the owner. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of Seminole County and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the public nuisance exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the owner. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this article shall continue to accrue until the owner comes into compliance or until the judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of a lien in the same manner as provided under section 2-61.5 of this Code, or may otherwise seek to foreclose on the lien. However, where the nuisance abatement action is based on a stolen property nuisance, and is brought against a property owner operating an establishment where multiple tenants, on one (1) site, conduct their own retail business, the property owner shall not be subject to a lien against the owner's property or the prohibition of operation provision if the property owner elects to evict the business declared to be a nuisance within ninety (90) days after notification by registered mail to the property owner of a second stolen property conviction of the tenant. Any lien recorded against real property may be foreclosed by the city and the owner of such real property shall be liable for all costs incurred by the city, including a reasonable attorney's fee through all appellate proceedings, associated with the recording of all orders and foreclosure. 
(Ord. No. 2003-33, § 2, 9-8-03) 
Sec. 13-77. - Appeal. 
    A party aggrieved by a final administrative order of the Nuisance Abatement Board shall have the right to appeal said order to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of procedure of the court.

The practice of distributing, casting, throwing, and otherwise placing circulars, handbills, newspapers, magazines, other papers or merchandise, on private residential property without the express consent of owner, or of an adult occupant, thereof, or of a person authorized by such owner or occupant to give such consent, creates a serious police problem and a threat to the public safety and welfare in that the owners and occupants of such property are unaware that such material is going to be thrown or placed thereon and are therefore unable to make proper, or any, provision to prevent the throwing or placing of such material thereon with the result that, without their prior knowledge or any consent and against their wishes, such property will be cluttered with an accumulation of such material, and their absence will be thereby inadvertently advertised to persons of dissolute or criminal propensities and the probability of criminal activities on such property will be thereby increased, all of which is detrimental to the peace, safety and welfare of the public. 
(b)  Concerning vehicles and public places. The practice of distributing and depositing, placing, throwing, scattering and casting such material in or upon motor vehicles and in and upon the public streets and in public places except to persons who are willing to receive the same, creates a serious police problem and a threat to the public safety in that such material is permitted to fall, and is thrown, upon parking areas, and public streets, public areas and is blown about and accumulates as trash and creates fire hazards and unsightly conditions and requires extra expense to remove such trash. 
(c)  Concerning aiding and abetting. The practice of causing and permitting the practices outlined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section by employees, agents and contractors creates serious problems and threats to the public safety and welfare in that such causing and permitting of the practices provides the inducement and consideration for the continuance thereof and constitute the source thereof. 
(d)  Concerning the need of law. The public interest, convenience and necessity require the removal of, and this article is enacted to remove, such police problems and threats to the public health, safety and welfare and require the protection of, and this article is enacted to protect, the people against the nuisance of, and incident to, the promiscuous distribution of circulars, handbills, newspapers, magazines and merchandise on private residential property, on vehicles and in public places.

(Code 1974, § 5-113(a); Ord. No. 2006-18, § 2, 10-23-06; Ord. No. 2013-09, § 2, 9-9-13) 
Sec. 16-77. - Outdoor display/billboards-Off-premises signs prohibited. 
(a)  Other than as provided within this section, off-premises signs, as defined in section 16-51 of the City Code, are strictly prohibited within the City of Winter Springs. 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything in the City of Winter Springs Code of Ordinances to the contrary, from and after the effective date of Ord. No. 2001-50 [Oct. 22, 2001], the total number of outdoor off-premises signs located in the incorporated areas of the city shall be limited as hereafter specified. 
(c)  The initial limitation on outdoor off-premises signs are the five (5) outdoor off-premises sign structures (hereinafter referred to as "Existing Structure(s)") currently existing in the incorporated areas of the city (the "Existing Structures"). An inventory of these existing structures dated October 22, 2001, as amended in June 2013, is filed in the community development department and is incorporated herein by this reference. 
(d)  The limit stated in subsection (c) above may only be increased by the number of lawfully existing off-premises sign structures within unincorporated areas of Seminole County which are annexed by the City of Winter Springs. Contemporaneously with annexation the city shall conduct a survey of all existing off-premises sign structures within the annexed portions of unincorporated Seminole County. The inventory of existing structures, on file with the community development department, shall be amended by resolution of the city commission to include the addition of legally existing off-premises sign structures. 
(e)  The limit stated in subsection (c) above, as may be amended by subsection (d), shall be correspondingly reduced upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1)  An existing structure is removed incident to a road widening or other public works project; and 
(2)  An existing structure is removed incident to the development or redevelopment of the property upon which the existing structure is located; or 
(3)  An existing structure is removed incident to the expiration of the lease or other agreement authorizing placement of the existing structure on the property. 
(4)  An existing structure which is non-conforming due to zoning is removed due to destruction, damage or other casualty which results in destruction of fifty (50) percent or more of the support structure for or of fifty (50) percent or more of the face of the sign. 
(5)  An existing structure is removed or dismantled by fifty (50) percent or more of the support structure or fifty (50) percent or more of the face of the sign. 
(6)  By the terms and conditions of a development agreement with the city, except that any development agreement after the effective date of this section shall not allow the removal of an existing structure later than the time that would otherwise be provided by this section. Any existing structure subject to a development agreement with the city prior to the effective date to this section shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection (e) and shall be removed in accordance with the terms of the development agreement. 
(f)  At any point in time the then current limit on the number of outdoor off-premises signs located in the incorporated areas of the city shall be the initial limit specified in subsection (c) and as amended by subsection (d) above less the total number of existing structures which have been removed as specified in subsection (e) above. 
(g)  In addition to the limitation specified above, there is hereby imposed a limitation upon the number, size and orientation of the sign faces located upon the existing structures. From and after the effective date of Ord. No. 2001-50 [Oct. 22, 2001], the number of sign faces on an existing structure may not be increased, either by adding an additional face oriented in a different direction or by changing the display mechanism to permit the display of multiple signs on a single sign face. From and after the effective date of this Ord. No. 2001-50, no sign face on an existing structure may be increased in size and the orientation of each sign face located upon an existing structure may not be changed. 
(h)  Except for an existing structure which is non-conforming (which cannot be replaced), an existing structure damaged or destroyed by flood, fire, earthquake, war, riot, act of God or other similar casualty loss may be reconstructed in the same location with the same (or smaller or fewer, as the case may be) size and number of sign faces. An existing structure may not be relocated to another location. 
(i)  Except as specifically authorized by permit issued by the State of Florida Department of Transportation or as required by specific state statute, no trees or vegetation shall be removed or trimmed from the property upon which an outdoor off-premises sign is located or from property adjacent thereto in order to enhance the visibility of the outdoor off-premises sign. 
(j)  In connection with any off-premise signs which are erected or constructed in violation of the provisions of this section, each day that said sign remains erected in violation of this section shall constitute a separate violation and each person responsible for erecting or constructing such off-premises sign, including but not limited to the real property owner, shall pay the city a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day until the off-premises sign is removed. 
(k)  This subsection is intended to provide requirements for a person to propose converting an existing structure identified on the aforementioned inventory list, and which is located on real property abutting U.S. 17-92 and within the Seminole County 17-92 Redevelopment Area, to an off-premises digital billboard sign under negotiated terms and conditions approved by the city commission. The purpose of this subsection is to adopt standards and restrictions for any such conversion that are pursuant to the interest of the citizens of the city and Seminole County and the redevelopment area related to visual aesthetics and the safety of vehicular traffic. No conversion shall be allowed in the city except as provided in this subsection. 
(1)  An owner of an existing structure subject to this subsection shall first be required to submit, in writing, a conversion request to the city for an informal and preliminary review to determine whether the city, at its discretion, desires to engage in more formal negotiations regarding the request. 
(2)  If the city desires to engage in formal negotiations, the owner shall be required, as a precondition to negotiations, to execute an affidavit on a form prepared by the city attorney. The affidavit shall provide at a minimum that the owner is acknowledging and agreeing that the future negotiations with the city are optional and at the sole discretion of the city. Further, the owner agrees that the city is under no obligation whatsoever to approve or deny the request and that the owner shall release and hold harmless the city regarding any decision made by the city on the request. Should the city commission decide to approve an owner's conversion proposal, the conversion shall be subject to terms and conditions of a binding written agreement and the following minimum standards and requirements: 
(i)  If the owner of the existing structure is not the owner of the property on which the existing structure is located, the owner of the property shall be required to approve and execute the agreement. Said agreement shall be recorded in the Official Records of Seminole County and shall be binding on the owner of the sign and the real property; 
(ii)  The conversion shall be subject to all applicable building, fire and land development codes and law; however, to the extent this section conflicts with state or federal law, the more restrictive will be applied by the city; 
(iii)  The following minimum technical display requirements shall apply unless the city commission requires more restrictive requirements by written agreement: 
1.  Display messages shall be static only. Such static images shall hold the display face for a minimum of eight (8) seconds before transitioning to another static image. 
2.  Transitions from one static image to the next shall appear within three (3) seconds and shall not have the appearance of flashing, flickering, blinking, pulsating animation or videos or varying light intensity. Dissolving from one static image to the next within the three (3) second transition period shall not constitute animation for purposes of this article. 
3.  The billboard shall come equipped with functioning automatic dimming technology which automatically adjusts, at all times while the electronic message center is operating, the sign's brightness in direct correlation with ambient light conditions. 
4.  No billboard shall be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility. No electronic billboard shall exceed a brightness level of 6,000 NITs (NITs are the standard measure of brightness for electronic signs and devices) during daytime use or 500 NITs during nighttime use and to account for adverse weather conditions that reduce the amount of sunlight. 
5.  No billboard shall display light of such intensity or brilliance as to cause glare or otherwise impair the vision of a driver or result in a nuisance. No billboard shall be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal. 
6.  The billboard shall have a default mechanism built in to either turn the display off or show "full black" on the display in the event of a malfunction. Malfunction is defined as any operation of the billboard that causes glare or impairs the vision of motorists or otherwise distracts motorists so as to interfere with the motorists' ability to safely operate their vehicles or otherwise constitutes a violation of the City Code. 
7.  The billboard shall not be configured to resemble a warning, danger signal, official signage used to control traffic or to cause a driver to mistake the billboard for a warning or danger signal. 
8.  Any billboard operating out of compliance with any standard of this section must immediately terminate displaying an image until compliance is achieved. 
(iv)  The maximum height of the billboard shall be fifty (50) feet measured from the crown of the adjacent U.S. 17-92 and shall be compatible with the surrounding area; 
(v)  The maximum size of the billboard face, as viewed from one direction, shall be six hundred seventy-two (672) square feet (fourteen (14) feet by forty-eight (48) feet). All visible portions of the back side of any billboard shall be painted monochromatic black or other monochromatic, dark, neutral color, as approved by the city. No embellishments and cut outs may be utilized on the billboard; 
(vi)  Notwithstanding the current location of the existing structure being removed pursuant to this subsection, the city may require the digital billboard to be located elsewhere on the subject property in order to provide adequate buffer distances from the digital billboard and U.S. 17-92 and other public right-of-way, as well as from other sensitive areas adjacent to the subject property, or require the billboard to be located on other property abutting U.S. 17-92 which is owned by the owner of the structure or subject property if the relocation of the structure more fully satisfies the purpose of subsection (k) in comparison to the property on which the structure currently exists; 
(vii)  The billboard may offer to provide copy space for public announcements like amber and silver alerts, public emergency notices, and community events; 
(viii)  Upon approval by the city, the billboard shall constitute an existing structure and shall remain on the inventory list pursuant to this section. 
(ix)  Section 16-77 encourages the removal of existing structures on the inventory list required by this section. Further, the city currently participates in the Seminole County 17-92 Community Redevelopment Agency for purposes of revitalizing and redeveloping the U.S. 17-92 corridor. In furtherance of these legitimate public purposes, the city may, in its discretion and as a condition of negotiating an agreement under this subsection, require a sign owner, in exchange for the right to construct a digital billboard, to agree to remove another existing, legally non-conforming billboard located elsewhere in the city or within any portion of the Seminole County 17-92 Redevelopment Area within or outside the city's jurisdictional boundaries.

Sec. 18-28. - Collection by seller. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural, liquefied or manufactured), and water service service within the city to collect from the purchaser, for the use of the city, the tax levied under section 18-26(a), at the time of collecting the charge therefor, and to file a return and remit, on or before the twentieth day of each calendar month, or if the twentieth day is either a legal holiday or is not a city business day, then on or before the first city business day that is not also a legal holiday, following the twentieth day of the month, unto the city, all such taxes levied and collected during the preceding calendar month. The date of receipt of such taxes by the city will be the date of postmark, or if by electronic transfer, the date received by the city's primary bank as indicated on the city's bank statement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the event the total amount of tax anticipated to be collected within a calendar quarter does not exceed one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00), the seller of such service may, with the authorization of the city, remit the taxes collected during such calendar quarter to the city quarterly.

Any seller remitting the tax by electronic transfer must nevertheless send periodic returns to the city. It shall be unlawful for any seller to collect for any such service without at the same time collecting the tax hereby levied with respect to such sales, unless such seller shall elect to assume and pay such tax without collecting the same from the purchaser. Any seller failing to collect such tax at the time of collecting for any such service, where the seller has not elected to assume and pay such tax, shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax in like manner as if the same had actually been paid to the seller, and the mayor of the city may cause to be brought all suit actions and to take all proceedings in the name of the city as may be necessary for the recovery of such tax; provided, however, that the seller shall not be liable for the payment of the tax upon uncollected bills.

To assure proper administration of the provisions of this chapter, the city may, where possible and practical, conduct a periodic audit of each sales records of all businesses in connection with which the tax is imposed under this chapter.

Each such seller must provide to the city, upon sixty (60) days written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this sixty-day period must be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the sixty-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than thirty (30) days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party. In an audit, the seller is liable only for its taxable accounts collected which correspond to the information provided to it by the city under section 166.233(3), Florida Statutes. As used in this section "applicable records" means records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due. Such applicable records may be provided to the city on an electronic medium if agreed to by the seller and the city.

(b)  Each and every seller of communications services within the city shall maintain such records as is required by Chapter 202, Florida Statutes (2000), as may be amended, and shall be subject to all auditing procedures provided for within Chapter 202, Florida Statutes (2000).

In the case of a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax, shall be liable for a specific penalty of one hundred (100) percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. The interest and penalties shall accrue from the due date until the date such taxes are paid; provided, however, that the city may settle or compromise any interest due pursuant to this section as is reasonable under the circumstances. 
(b)  The city is entitled to and may assess against any seller not complying with any provision of this chapter, a fee based upon the actual costs incurred by the city in collecting the tax or the information due.

Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein.

The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action.

(c)  All written objections to the final assessment resolution shall be filed with the city manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual rate resolution for the initial fiscal year in which fire rescue assessments are imposed or reimposed hereunder.

Sec. 18-177. - Effect of final assessment resolution. 
    The fire rescue assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property; the method of apportionment and assessment; the initial rate of assessment; the maximum assessment rate, if any; the initial assessment roll; and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city commission action on the final assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the uniform assessment collection act, or if the alternative method described in section 18-202 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.07, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-178. - Adoption of annual rate resolution. 
(a)  The city commission shall adopt an annual rate resolution during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which a fire rescue assessment is imposed hereunder. 
(b)  The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate resolution by the city commission: 
(1)  Containing a brief and general description of the fire rescue services, facilities, or programs to be provided; 
(2)  Determining the fire rescue assessed cost to be assessed for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(3)  Establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(4)  Establishing or increasing a maximum assessment rate, if desired by the city commission; 
(5)  Authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to receive and consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of the annual rate resolution for the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(6)  Directing the city manager to: 
a.  Update the assessment roll; 
b.  Provide notice by publication and first class mail to affected owners in the event circumstances described in subsection (f) of this section so require; and 
c.  Directing and authorizing any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the city. 
(c)  The annual rate resolution shall: 
(1)  Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; and

The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent preliminary rate resolution, together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from providing annual notification to all owners of assessed property in the manner provided in sections 18-174 and 18-175 hereof or any other method as provided by law. 
(e)  The city commission may establish or increase a maximum assessment rate in an initial assessment resolution or preliminary rate resolution and confirm such maximum assessment rate in the event notice of such maximum rate assessment has been included in the notices required by section 18-174 and 18-175 hereof. 
(f)  In the event (1) the proposed fire rescue assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the rates of assessment adopted by the city commission including a maximum assessment rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 18-174 and 18-175 hereof, (2) the purpose for which the fire rescue assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the fire rescue assessment is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 18-174 and 18-175 hereof, (3) assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased fire rescue assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 18-174 and 18-175 hereof, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in sections 18-174 and 18-175 hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(g)  As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the final assessment resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment, the establishment or increase of a maximum assessment rate, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any fire rescue assessment not challenged within the required twenty-day period for those fire rescue assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(h)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required by the uniform assessment collection act, or if the alternative method described in section 18-202 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. If the fire rescue assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.08, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-179. - Lien of fire rescue assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire rescue assessments shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection act shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 18-202 shall be deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.09, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-180. - Revisions to fire rescue assessments. 
    If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such fire rescue assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city commission has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll, which property should have been so included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire rescue assessment against any property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire rescue assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city commission may obtain and impose other fire rescue assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.10, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-181. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire rescue assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.11, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-182. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission under the provision of this article. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 18-175, impose the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such fire rescue assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in Division 3 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire rescue assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.12, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-183. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim fire rescue assessment may be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim fire rescue assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim fire rescue assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire rescue assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire rescue assessment. 
(b)  Issuance of the certificate of occupancy without the payment in full of the interim fire rescue assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire rescue assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 18-201 of this article, under the alternative collection method provided in section 18-202 or by any other method authorized by law. 
(c)  Any interim fire rescue assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 2.13, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-184. - Authorization for exemptions and hardship assistance. 
(a)  The city commission, in its sole discretion, shall determine on an annual basis whether to provide exemptions from payment of the fire rescue assessment for government property or institutional property whose use is wholly or partially exempt from ad valorem taxation under Florida law. 
(b)  The city commission, in its sole discretion, shall determine on an annual basis whether to provide a program of hardship assistance to city residents who are living below or close to the poverty level and are at risk of losing title to their homes as a result of the imposition of the fire rescue assessments. 
(c)  On an annual basis, the city commission shall designate the funds available to provide any exemptions or hardship assistance. The provision of an exemption or hardship assistance in any one year shall in no way establish a right or entitlement to such exemption or assistance in any subsequent year and the provision of funds in any year may be limited to the extent funds are available and appropriated by the city commission. Any funds designated for exemptions or hardship assistance shall be paid by the city from funds other than those generated by the fire rescue assessment. 
(d)  Any shortfall in the expected fire rescue assessment proceeds due to any hardship assistance or exemption from payment of the fire rescue assessments required by law or authorized by the city commission shall be supplemented by any legally available funds, or combination of such funds, and shall not be paid for by proceeds or funds derived from the fire rescue assessments. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines any exemption or reduction by the city commission is improper or otherwise adversely affects the validity of the fire rescue assessment imposed for any fiscal year, the sole and exclusive remedy shall be the imposition of a fire rescue assessment upon each affected tax parcel in the amount of the fire rescue assessment that would have been otherwise imposed save for such reduction or exemption afforded to such tax parcel by the city commission.

Sec. 18-201. - Method of collection. 
(a)  Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the fire rescue assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act or other provision of law. 
(b)  The amount of a fire rescue assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefited property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(1)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(2)  Notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and 
(3)  Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such fire rescue assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-01, § 3.01, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 18-202. - Alternative method of collection. 
    In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city commission may elect to collect the fire rescue assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this section: 
(a)  The city commission shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property that is subject to the fire rescue assessment. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include:

(b)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire rescue assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the city. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(c)  The city commission shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire rescue assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date payment was due, as identified in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The city commission or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city commission or its agent will either: 
(1)  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
(2)  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city commission or its agent may join in one foreclosure action the collection of fire rescue assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city commission and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
(1)  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article; and 
(2)  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the city commission's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or other city officials in section 18-182 hereof. 
(g)  Any city commission action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by resolution.

(1)  A brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment; 
(2)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment;

(4)  The total amount of the parcel's fire rescue assessment for the appropriate period;

(b)  Fire rescue assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other fire rescue assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date payment was due, as identified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The city commission shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the city commission will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a fire rescue assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in periodic installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city commission may contract for such billing services with any utility, whether or not such utility is owned by the city.

The lien shall accrue interest at the statutory interest rate imposed for judgments in Florida. The lien shall be prior to all other liens on such property except the lien of federal, state, county, and municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of such federal, state, county, and municipal taxes. In the event the city must take such action to enforce the lien, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs associated with collecting the unpaid fees including, but not limited to, court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

Sec. 19-97. - Billing, payment, delinquency. 
(a)  Users of the water and/or wastewater system shall be billed monthly and payment shall be due when rendered. If payment is not received by the city in full within twenty (20) days from the date of mailing, the unpaid amount is to be considered to be in arrears and shall be considered delinquent and a delinquent notice will be issued. If there is an arrearage amount due when the delinquent bill is printed, a late fee will be assessed at the rate of five (5) percent per month on the arrearage amount or five dollars ($5.00), whichever amount is greater. The city may waive the late fee one (1) time in any twenty-four-month period if the user has demonstrated reasonable hardship or if the user opts into one of the city's preferred payment methods. Preferred payment methods include those that are automated, recurring and electronically received. 
(b)  The customer shall be notified of the delinquent amount along with the late fee charges by reference in the mailing of a delinquent notice as considered necessary by the city manager or his designee.

(Code 1974, § 16-46; Ord. No. 449, § I, 1-9-89; Ord. No. 538, § I, 12-14-92; Ord. No. 702, § I, 6-8-98; Ord. No. 2002-20, § 2, 6-24-02; Ord. No. 2007-08, § 2, 4-9-07; Ord. No. 2011-11, § 2, 8-22-11) 
Sec. 19-98. - Appeals. 
(a)  Any user who feels their monthly bill for water and sewer service is unjust and inequitable may make written application to the city manager or his designee requesting a review of their monthly bill within ten (10) days after the date of rendering the bill by the city. The written request shall, at a minimum, show the basis of the adjustment, including the actual or estimated average flow of the water and sewer use in comparison to the amount upon which the charge is based and include a statement explaining the methods used in calculating the measurements or estimates for the appeal. 
(b)  The city manager or his designee shall review the request and, if substantiated, the monthly bill for that user shall be recomputed based on the revised flow data and the new charge shall be adjusted on the next bill. The decision of the city manager may be appealed to the city commission whose decision shall be final and binding. 
(Code 1974, § 16-47; Ord. No. 702, § II, 6-8-98) 
Secs. 19-98.5. - Policy for bill adjustments for unexplained excessive use. 
(a)  Definitions: Except as otherwise provided for in this Resolution, all definitions reflected in Chapter 19 entitled "Utilities" are applicable to the provisions of this policy. 
(1)  Unexplained excessive use shall mean the amount of potable water use metered by the city at an individual customer's premise for a single billing period which is not considered as being customary for that account and is not known as to why the consumption occurred based on the usage criteria reflected in this policy. 
(2)  Individually metered residential service shall refer to those water accounts classified as being residential whose domestic water requirements are individually metered by the city. If the applicable customer has a single water meter that registers both domestic and irrigation water consumption, the measured water consumption associated with this meter will be considered as domestic water use. If the applicable customer has a dual domestic and irrigation service (two meters) which allows for the separate metering of both types of water use, only the meter which measures water consumption primarily for indoor use will be considered as the metered domestic water use for the purposes of this policy. 
(3)  Applicant shall mean the customer, property owner, or person that applies for an unexplained excessive use credit with the city pursuant to the terms of this policy. 
(4)  Rate ordinance shall refer to Chapter 19 entitled "Utilities" of the city's Code of Ordinances which delineates, among other things, i) the monthly rates for water and wastewater service; ii) provisions regarding the billing, payment, and delinquency of utility bills; iii) appeals for the review of monthly utility bills by an account or property owner to the city; and iv) other applicable provisions relative to the rendition of service to the city's utility customers which are relied upon in the determination of this policy. 
(b)  Unexplained excessive use criteria: 
(1)  The criteria used by the city in the determination of unexplained excessive water use in a particular billing period for an individually metered residential account as it relates solely to the application of this policy is as follows: 
a.  The metered water use of an account for the particular billing period shall be at least four (4) times the average water use of such account for the last twelve (12) consecutive months as metered and billed by the city. 
b.  The metered water use of an account for the particular billing period shall be at least two (2) times the previous highest monthly water use of such account for the last twelve (12) consecutive months as metered and billed by the city. 
c.  Water service to the account must have occurred for a minimum of twelve (12) consecutive months prior to the month where the unexplained excessive use as occurred with no months having a zero (0) usage period. 
d.  The occupants of the subject residential account must have lived in the residence continuously for twelve (12) consecutive months consistent with the historical water use period that is being relied upon in the determination of unexplained excessive use. 
e.  The net amount of metered potable water registered at the domestic meter which is considered as being excessive for the particular billing period must be a minimum of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons when compared to the average and maximum month water use for the account. 
(2)  In the review of the water use and applicant characteristics as it relates to the review of the excessive use criteria discussed in subsection 19-98.5(b)(1) above, all of the criteria must be satisfied in order for the city to consider any utility bill adjustment in accordance with this policy. The requirements for providing proof of occupancy during the previous twelve (12) months are the responsibility of the applicant. 
(c)  Applicability: The unexplained excessive use policy is only applicable to individually metered residential accounts and does not include service to master-metered residential service, commercial or non-residential service, or individually metered irrigation service. For single family residences that have a separate meter specific for measuring irrigation or outdoor water use, this policy does not apply to any water use measured by this irrigation meter. For those accounts that are not subject to the provisions of this unexplained excessive use policy, such accounts may still follow the general utility bill appeal process as allowed by the city's rate ordinance. 
(d)  City field service requirements: 
(1)  Any applicant receiving individually metered residential service who feels that the monthly bill for potable water service is excessive and the reasons for such excessive use is not known or explainable by the applicant may make a written application or make an on-site appearance (the "application") to the finance director or his/her designee requesting for a bill evaluation and potential adjustment in accordance with this policy. The application by the applicant must be within ten (10) days after the date of rendering (mailing) of the bill by the city. 
(2)  Once an application is made by an applicant for review of the utility bill accordance with this policy and the unexplained excessive use meets the water use criteria as delineated in this policy as determined by the city, the city shall perform the following field service activities in order to evaluate the metered water consumption at the applicant's premise: 
a.  The city will reread the water consumption at the meter to verify the accuracy of the initial water reading and for consistency in the amount of water consumption billed to the applicant. 
b.  The city will remove the current meter from the applicant's premise and install a new meter which is considered by the city to be measuring potable water use within the accuracy standards as defined by the meter manufacturer of the particular meter being installed. 
c.  The city will perform a flow or "bench" test of the meter that was removed from the applicant's premise with the city's testing equipment to verify the flow registration accuracy of such meter. 
d.  Only with the prior receipt of the concurrence from the applicant which filed the application for the excessive use adjustment, the city will send a utility field representative to the applicant's premise or property to conduct a general visual review of such premises to identify any unique circumstances and to assist the customer with addressing the unexplained excessive use situation. This review is not considered by the city as a detailed inspection or water use audit of the property to verify use or specific conditions and is expected to be performed during the removal of the existing meter and the installation of the new meter. 
e.  The city will notify the applicant by direct mail the results of the city's meter flow test and report whether the meter was registering potable water use within the accuracy limits established by the meter manufacturer within, to the extent practical, five (5) business days after the removal of the meter from the applicant's premise. 
(e)  Calculation of excess potable water use potentially eligible for credit: 
(1)  If the city determines that the potable water meter that was removed from the applicant's premise was measuring the potable water use at such premise inaccurately, the city will recalculate the utility bill in accordance with its general policy and notify the applicant of the amount due. To the extent that the recalculated bill would still result in an unexplained excessive use position, then the provisions of this policy will still be applicable. 
(2)  Based on the city's review of the prior twelve (12) months domestic metered water consumption history when compared to that period of time (not to exceed one (1) billing period) for which the unexplained excessive water use was measured by the city, the city will determine the unexplained excessive use credit as follows: 
a.  The city will determine the average monthly water use for the applicant during the previous twelve (12) months that will serve as the maximum water consumption or usage (rate) threshold for the determination of the unexplained excessive use credit. The difference between the actual metered water consumption registered by the meter and the consumption determined to be the maximum water use threshold will i) considered as being used by the applicant and ii) will be billed at the first water consumption block rate applicable to the individually metered residential class in effect at the time of the application for the unexplained excessive use credit by the applicant, all in accordance with the provisions of the city's rate ordinance. 
b.  The amount of metered water consumption not considered as being excessive (i.e., up to and equal to the maximum water use threshold) will be calculated in accordance with the prevailing water consumption or usage rates in effect at the time of the application for the unexplained excessive use credit by the applicant, all in accordance with the provisions of the city's rate ordinance. 
c.  If the applicant also receives wastewater service from the city, the city will determine the maximum monthly wastewater to be billed to the applicant based on the amount of use which would be billed recognizing the maximum consumption threshold for the determination of the unexplained excessive use credit. In no event will the adjusted usage amount exceed the maximum wastewater billing threshold for individually metered residential customers as reflected in the city's rate ordinance. To the extent that the amount of the unexplained potable water use being considered as excessive use results in an increase in the amount of wastewater use being billed to the applicant, the amount of such use above the maximum monthly wastewater billed will be credited to the applicant. Specifically, the amount of wastewater billed for the particular billing period under review will not exceed the maximum amount of wastewater billed during any billing period during the previous twelve (12) months for such applicant. 
d.  If the unexplained excessive use credit as calculated by the city is accepted by the applicant, the city will adjust the amount of the water and/or wastewater bill due the city and the total amount of the adjusted bill will be due and payable to the city by the applicant in accordance with city policy. 
e.  Included on Attachment A is a template and example to illustrate the calculation of the unexplained excessive use credit. 
(f)  Payment provisions. 
(1)  All provisions of the rate ordinance relative to the payment of utility bills are applicable under this policy. 
(2)  If the adjusted utility bill for service, even after the recognition of the excessive use credit, results in a monthly bill which is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) of the maximum bill incurred for utility service by the applicant during the previous twelve (12) months, the city at its sole discretion may allow for the payment of the excess water use component of the bill on an installment basis. The payment of the excess water use on an installment basis will not exceed six (6) consecutive months and will be billed uniformly over the installment period. The installment period must be finalized between the city and the applicant prior to the due date of the current utility bill that was under review by the city and will be included on the utility bill for monthly service during the installment period. The billing of the installments will begin on the next immediate bill for service. In no event will the city allow the payment of the excessive water use on an installment basis if the applicant has not achieved a good payment history (no delinquent payments or if applicant has had service discontinued for nonpayment) during the past twelve (12) months of service. 
(3)  To the extent that an applicant elects the installment method of payment of the unexplained excessive use charges, all of the city's rules and regulations relative to the billing and payment for service in accordance with the city's rate ordinance will apply, including the provision that the applicant's utility service may discontinued for the nonpayment of utility service. 
(4)  If the applicant requests a verification of the flow test performed by the city by a third party (e.g.meter manufacturer or another utility), and the results of such test are consistent with the results of the city's flow test (whereby the results would not result in a change of general accuracy of the meter), the applicant will be responsible for the actual cost of such tests. The actual cost is the amount invoiced by the third party to the city for the performance of the additional flow test and will not include any costs or markup for administration by the city. If the test results performed by the third party indicate that the meter is not registering within the accuracy limits in accordance with city policy, the meter will be considered as being inaccurate and the bill recalculation policy of the city will be performed. 
(5)  To the extent that the applicant does not accept the results of the unexplained excessive use credit as determined by the city under this policy, then the entire amount as initially billed by the city for utility service shall be due and payable in accordance with the provisions of the rate ordinance. The applicant shall have the right to appeal the utility bill in accordance with the provisions of the rate ordinance. Any reductions in the amount billed which may be due to the applicant as a result of the appeal of utility bill will be credited by the city in the next immediate bill rendered to the applicant after the appeal has been finalized. 
(g)  Limitations on adjustment eligibility and other miscellaneous provisions: 
(1)  No unexplained excessive use credit to an applicant's utility bill determined in accordance with this policy will be permitted more than once a year or no more than twice within ten (10) years. No unexplained excessive use credit will extend beyond one (1) billing period. 
(2)  If an applicant accepts the unexplained excessive use credit as determined by the city and the credit is applied to the applicant's monthly utility bill, the applicant will waive the right to subsequently appeal the said utility bill in accordance with the provisions of the rate ordinance. 
(Res. No. 2001-39, §§ I-VII, 10-29-01) 
Sec. 19-99. - Annual rate review. 
(a)  The city shall review the user charge at least annually and revise the rates as necessary to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to pay the costs of operation and maintenance and replacement including depreciation and debt service and the sewerage system capital improvement account. The system shall also be reviewed to ensure that it continues to provide for the proportional distribution charges among users and user classes. 
(b)  The city shall notify each user at least annually of the rate being charged for operation, and maintenance, and replacement including debt service and depreciation of the water and sewer utility system.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 357, §§ 1-4, adopted Dec. 8, 1986, enacted provisions adopting a sewerage revenue generation system. Such provisions, being nonamendatory of the Code, have been included herein as Art. IV, §§ 16-61-16-64, at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 19-126. - Accounts established. 
    The city hereby establishes two (2) separate accounts into which deposits required for accumulation of the equivalent future value of the grant amount shall be made, to wit: 
(1)  Sewerage system capital improvement account-Source wastewater development charges; and 
(2)  Sewerage system capital improvement account-Other sources. 
The sewerage system capital improvement account-Source wastewater system development charges shall be segregated from any other source of money in order that the city can monitor and maintain its compliance with the Dunedin decision. 
(Code 1974, § 16-61) 
Sec. 19-127. - Deposits. 
(a)  Deposits to the sewerage system capital improvement accounts shall commence not later than the end of each one-year period beginning with the date of initiation of operation of the complete grant funded treatment works. Beneficial occupancy shall be deemed the date of initiation of operation of the complete grant funded treatment works. The number of annual deposits shall be twenty (20), which is the weighted design life of the treatment works as calculated by the city's utilities consulting engineers. Deposits into sewerage system capital improvement accounts shall be made annually, or, at the discretion of the city's finance director, more frequently. Deposits shall be made not later than on the last business day preceding the anniversary date of beneficial occupancy. The city does not have any plans at present for early termination of deposits into the sewerage system capital improvement accounts. The city may, however, make prepayments into these funds upon the recommendation of the city's finance director and approval of the city manager. Deposits may be terminated once the sum of all deposits exceeds twenty (20) times the annual deposit determined below. 
(b)  The aggregate amount of the annual deposits into the sewerage system capital improvement accounts shall be determined by the following formula: 
i(1 + i) DL _____(1 + i) DL-1  
Where: 
D = required annual deposit G = grant amount actually 
received by city i = 0.078 DL = 20 years  
(c)  The sources of revenue for the required deposits shall be as follows: 
(1)  Wastewater system development charges (to the extent permitted by law). 
(2)  Current-year surpluses from the revenue fund. 
(3)  Prior-year surpluses from the revenue fund. 
If the above sources of revenues are collectively insufficient to make the annual deposit, then the wastewater user charges shall be increased to provide the remaining source of funds necessary for such annual deposits above those required by the city's revenue rate covenant to cover any bonded indebtedness deficiencies in debt service. 
(d)  Deposits into the sewerage system capital improvement accounts shall be invested in accordance with the city's normal practice for investment of funds, but shall be accounted for separately. 
(Code 1974, § 16-62) 
Sec. 19-128. - Expenditures. 
    Accrued moneys in the sewerage system capital improvement accounts shall be expended for any permissible purpose including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Capacity expansion of any wastewater system facility. 
(2)  Replacement of any wastewater system component which has reached the end of its design life. 
(3)  Repair and/or replacement of treatment plant, pumping station or major transmission facilities in the event that these items are undertaken as part of capacity expansion or upgrade necessary to meet more stringent effluent limitations required by a regulatory agency or are necessitated as the result of manmade or natural disaster. 
(Code 1974, § 16-63) 
Sec. 19-129. - Accountant certification of adequate maintenance. 
    The city shall engage a certified public accounting firm to prepare and submit annually to the state department of environmental regulation a certification that the revenue generation system has been maintained in accordance with chapter 17-50, Florida Administrative Code.

(Ord. No. 521, § 2, 7-27-92; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 4, 10-25-10) 
Sec. 19-163. - Stormwater management utility fee created. 
(a)  A stormwater management utility fee (the "fee"), is hereby created and imposed on all developed property within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater management system. The developed property owner is responsible for payment of the fee. For the purposes of imposing the fee, all developed property within the city shall be classified either as: 
(1)  Residential developed property; or 
(2)  Nonresidential developed property. 
(b)  The city manager or his designee shall obtain a list each year from the Seminole County property appraiser of property within the city and shall assign each parcel a classification of residential developed property or nonresidential developed property. 
(Ord. No. 721, § 3, 7-27-92) 
Sec. 19-164. - Schedule of rates. 
(a)  The stormwater management utility fee shall be adopted from time to time by ordinance of the City Commission (the "rate ordinance"), and shall be calculated for each developed property as follows: 
(1)  The fee for residential developed property is the rate for one (1) ERU multiplied by the number of dwelling units existing on the property. Accessory dwelling units that are separately metered for utilities shall be considered an additional dwelling unit for purposes of calculating and billing the fee to the accessory dwelling unit. That is, Fee = ERU × number of Dwelling Units. 
(2)  The fee for nonresidential property is the rate for one (1) ERU multiplied by the numerical factor. The numerical factor is obtained by dividing the total impervious area in square feet of the nonresidential property by the square footage for one (1) ERU as set forth in the rate resolution. The resulting calculation is, Fee = ERU rate × (parcel impervious area expressed in square feet/the square footage for one (1) ERU). 
(b)  The minimum fee for developed property, whether residential or nonresidential, is equal to the rate for one (1) ERU, subject to reduction as set forth in subparagraph (c) below. 
(c)  Facility credit. 
(1)  In order to encourage the improvement of the quality of stormwater runoff, a reduction in the stormwater management utility fee is authorized for those developed properties which have a stormwater management facility designed and constructed for the purpose of stormwater pollution reduction. 
(2)  A reduction in the fee is allowed for a particular developed property only if the stormwater runoff from the property is treated by a stormwater management facility that has been designed, constructed and is maintained properly for the purpose of stormwater pollution reduction. If it is determined by the director that the stormwater management facility has not been, or is not currently being, properly maintained as designed, the director may disallow the on-site stormwater quality management facility credit. 
(3)  For applicable properties as determined by the director, the fee shall be reduced by twenty-five (25) percent. The reduced fee will, therefore, be calculated as the fee pursuant to the rate resolution multiplied by the factor of 0.75 (fee × 0.75). 
(d)  Undeveloped property. There shall be no stormwater management utility fee charged to undeveloped property that has not been altered from its natural state by dredging, filling, removal of trees and vegetation or other activities which have disturbed or altered the topography or soils on the property. 
(Ord. No. 521, § 4, 7-27-92; Ord. No. 2002-20, § 6, 6-24-02; Ord. No. 2004-01, § 2, 1-26-04; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 4, 10-25-10) 
Sec. 19-165. - Billing, payment, penalties and enforcement. 
(a)  Statements for the stormwater management utility fee shall be rendered monthly in accordance with a monthly billing cycle administered by the city for all properties subject to the fee. Only developed property shall be subject to the fee. 
(b)  The stormwater management utility fee is for services furnished to the developed property and the fee therefore must be paid by the property owner. If the property is tenant-occupied, the property owner may request that the city bill the tenant for such fee. Such instructions shall be in writing. If the property is tenant-occupied and the tenant is to be billed for such fee, any delinquent fee shall be charged against any utility deposit then held by the city. If the tenant fails to pay the fee, the property owner shall remain liable for the fee. 
(c)  Any fee remaining unpaid on a developed property for ninety (90) days shall constitute a lien in favor of the city against said property, and the city attorney is authorized and directed to record a lien for such unpaid fee in the public records of Seminole County, Florida. Such lien shall be superior in dignity to any encumbrances on the said property, whether occurring prior to or subsequent to such lien being recorded, except for tax liens, and may be foreclosed by the city as provided by law. 
(d)  Statements for the stormwater management utility fee shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as they are otherwise set forth for other utility fees administered by the city. The property owner will be notified of any delinquency in the payment of the stormwater management utility fee in the same manner that delinquent water and sewer bills are notified, and the failure to pay such fee as is otherwise provided in the statement shall subject the property to the discontinuance of water and sewer services and shall subject the owner of the developed property to all other penalties and charges available under the law relative to the discontinuance of such utility services. 
(e)  The owner of developed property that is not served by city water and sewer shall not be required to pay the city a stormwater management utility fee deposit. 
(f)  The administrative appeal and hearing procedure applicable to the discontinuance of utility services shall be applicable to the discontinuance of such services for the nonpayment of the stormwater management utility fee. 
(Ord. No. 521, § 5, 7-27-92; Ord. No. 702, § IX, 6-8-98) 
Sec. 19-166. - Adjustment of fees. 
(a)  Any owner, tenant or occupant who has paid the fee assessed against his property and who believes that the fee is in error may, subject to the limitations set forth in this section, submit an adjustment request to the city manager. 
(1)  Adjustment requests shall be made in writing and shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which the request is made. 
(2)  The city manager shall review the adjustment request within ninety (90) days of the submittal of the request and shall respond in writing to the applicant, either denying or granting the request with the reasons therefore stated in such response. 
(3)  The rate adjustment, if granted, will apply retroactively to the date on which the erroneous information was applied to the applicant's fee, but not to exceed one (1) year prior to the adjustment request. 
(4)  If this adjustment is denied, the applicant may, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the denial, petition for a review of the adjustment request by the city commission. The city commission shall review the adjustment request in accordance with the provisions set forth in this article as well as the evidence provided in the original adjustment request and supplemental evidence requested by the city manager or provided by the applicant prior to the decision made by the city manager. Within sixty (60) days after applicant files the petition, the city commission shall, in writing, either grant or deny the petition. If the petition is granted, the city manager will apply the adjustment to the fee for the requesting customer for the retroactive period identified by the city commission. If the petition is denied, the petitioner may appeal to circuit court, provided said appeal is filed within thirty (30) days after the commission renders its decision. 
(b)  The city manager, upon discovering an error or oversight in the calculation of the fee, may initiate an adjustment request. The request must be made in writing documenting the reasons for the adjustment. In the event that the adjustment would require an increase in the fee, the city manager must provide the adjustment request to the affected fee payer thirty (30) days prior to adjusting the fee and offer the fee payer an opportunity within the stated thirty (30) days to request an adjustment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) above. An increase or decrease in fee shall not be retroactively effective more than one (1) year from the date of adjustment. 
(Ord. No. 521, § 6, 7-27-92) 
Sec. 19-167. - Stormwater management utility fund.

ARTICLE IX. - PROPER USE OF FERTILIZERS 

Sec. 19-310. - Findings. 
    As a result of impairment to the city surface waters caused by excessive nutrients, or, as a result of increasing levels of nitrogen in the surface and ground water within the aquifers and springs within the boundaries of the city, the city commission hereby determines that the use of fertilizers on lands within the city creates a risk of contributing to adverse effects on surface and ground water. Accordingly, the city commission hereby finds that management measures contained in the most recent edition of the Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries are required. 
(Ord. No. 2017-08, § 2, 8-14-17) 
Sec. 19-311. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  This article IX: 
(1)  Regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; 
(2)  Requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; 
(3)  Establishes training and licensing requirements; 
(4)  Establishes a prohibited application period; and 
(5)  Specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods. 
(b)  Fertilizer free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This article IX requires the use of best management practices, which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, springs, lakes, and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural, and economic well-being of city residents and the health of the public in general. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both nitrogen and phosphorus contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

(9)  The proposed rezoning change will not seriously reduce light or air to adjacent areas; 
(10)  Should the city be presented with competent substantial evidence indicating that property values will be adversely affected by the proposed rezoning, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed rezoning change will not adversely affect property values in the surrounding area;

(1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
(2)  That literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(3)  That the special conditions and circumstances referred to in subsection (d)(1) of this section do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
(4)  That approval of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district.

(6)  That approval of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2004-49, § 2, 12-13-04; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 4-26-10)

Sec. 20-34. - Waivers. 
(a)  Any real property owner may file a waiver application requesting a waiver for their real property from any term and condition of this chapter (except from the list of permitted, conditional and prohibited uses set forth in any zoning district category) if the property owner clearly demonstrates that the applicable term or condition clearly creates an illogical, impossible, impractical, or patently unreasonable result.

(6)  The proposed development plan is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 2004-49, § 2, 12-13-04; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 20-35. - Administrative appeals. 
(a)  Any final administrative decision regarding the enforcement or interpretation of this chapter, where it is alleged there is an error by an administrative official, can be appealed as set forth in this section. 
(b)  Appeals shall be taken within thirty (30) days after such administrative decision is made by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager stating the name of the decision maker, date of the decision, applicable code provisions and the specific grounds for appeal. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the city manager shall schedule the appeal before the planning and zoning board and transmit all documents, plans, papers or other materials constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(c)  The planning and zoning board shall be required to review all administrative appeals and make a recommendation to the city commission.

(1)  Whether the applicant was properly afforded procedural due process; 
(2)  Whether the decision under review is supported by competent, substantial evidence; and 
(3)  Whether the decision under review complied with applicable law, including a proper interpretation of any provision under this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2004-49, § 2, 12-13-04; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 20-36. - Expiration of conditional use, variance and waiver approvals. 
(a)  Any conditional use, variance or waiver approved by the city commission under this Division shall expire two (2) years after the effective date of such approval by the city commission, unless a building permit based upon and incorporating the conditional use, variance, or waiver is issued by the city within said time period. Upon written request of the property owner, the city commission may extend the expiration date, without public hearing, an additional six months, provided the property owner demonstrates good cause for the extension. In addition, if the aforementioned building permit is timely issued, and the building permit subsequently expires and the subject development project is abandoned or discontinued for a period of six months, the conditional use, variance or waiver shall be deemed expired and null and void. 
(b)  The city commission hereby finds that there may be one or more unexpired conditional use, variance, or waiver permits previously granted by the City that may have never been acted upon or abandoned by the property owner. The city commission finds that these unexpired permits may now be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare of the community due to changed circumstances in the surrounding neighborhood and changes in law. Therefore, the provisions of this section shall apply retroactively to any unexpired conditional use, variance, and waiver previously granted by the city commission. It is the intent and purpose of this subsection to void any previously granted conditional use, variance, and waiver permit that does not comply with the provisions of this section and to require the property owner to reapply, under current circumstances, for said permit should the property owner desire or need said permit. 
(Ord. No. 2004-49, § 2, 12-13-04) 
Sec. 20-37. - Limited administrative waivers. 
(a)  Authorization by city manager. Waivers to the adopted land development regulations set forth in this chapter may be authorized administratively by the city manager or designee, subject to the procedures and limitations of this section. Designees under this section may be approved by city manager by written administrative order. 
(b)  Waivers subject to administrative review and approval. 
(1)  Administrative waivers may be considered for height, area, or size of a structure; and/or distance requirement, size of yard and open space requirements of an applicable zoning district. Administrative waivers shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the applicable requirement. 
The city manager may authorize the administrative review and approval of a waiver when a property owner clearly demonstrates: 
a.  The waiver is necessary, as a condition of city permit approval, to allow the reasonable use of the subject property and any proposed or existing improvements thereon; and 
b.  Such waiver will not: (i) have more than a de minimus impact on the subject property and surrounding area; (ii) be contrary to the public interest; (iii) be incompatible with the surrounding area; (iv) have an adverse effect on the neighborhood or general welfare of the area; and (v) have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of any applicable provision of this chapter. 
(c)  Application submittal and fee. Application for an administrative waiver shall be made on a form provided by the community development department and shall be accompanied by an application fee established by the city. As part of the application, the city manager reserves the right to require a signed affidavit (submitted on a form prepared by the city) from all abutting property owners indicating no objection to the requested waiver. In such case, failure of the applicant to obtain signatures of all abutting property owners will constitute a basis for denying the application. For the purpose of this section, the term "abutting" shall include those properties directly across a road. 
(d)  Conditions. The city manager may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to ensure that the purposes of this section, chapter and other applicable regulations set forth in the City Code are carried out, and to ensure that the waiver granted is the minimum necessary to allow reasonable use of the land and improvements. 
(e)  Further action. Applications approved by the city manager under this section shall be deemed final. However, a denial of a request for an administrative waiver by the city manager shall be considered a non-final order of the city and shall not be appealable. Applications denied under this section shall not preclude an applicant from requesting a variance or waiver from the city commission pursuant to other applicable provisions of this chapter. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a formal application for a variance or waiver consistent with the requirements set forth in this chapter, and decisions made on such applications shall be deemed final and subject to appeal in a court of competent jurisdiction.

    The provisions of this district are intended to apply to lands and structures, by their use and location, which are especially adapted to the business of wholesale distribution, storage and light manufacturing and to authorized land uses and activities which could cause adverse secondary effects and influences on residential areas and nonindustrial uses. Such lands are located in close proximity to principal thoroughfares and adequately separated (or buffered or both) from residential uses. The purpose of this district is to encourage and develop exceptionally clean, non-objectionable industrial uses and to allow a place for other uses and activities which could cause adverse secondary effects and influences on surrounding neighborhoods if located elsewhere.

All uses allowed hereunder shall abide by the performance and development standards of the city, county, state, and U.S. government. Areas of the city for which this zoning category may be appropriate are designated on the future land use map as "industrial."

DIVISION 12. - TOWN CENTER DISTRICT CODE[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2012-06, § 2, adopted March 12, 2012, amended Division 12 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Division 12, §§ 20-320-20-327, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 707, § 1 (Exh. A), 6-12-00; Ord. No. 2005-24, § 2, 7-11-05; Ord. No. 2007-30, § 2, 12-10-07; Ord. No. 2010-21, § 2, 9-13-10. 

Sec. 20-320. - Intent. 
(a)  The City of Winter Springs seeks to create a town center based upon traditional standards for city building. 
    In February, 1998 the City of Winter Springs created a plan for the town center through a design session involving the community and a team of design professionals. This division is based on that plan. Traditional urban design conventions have been applied to create a palette of squares, parks, and street types that form the framework for the town center. 
    On August 1, 2011, city staff and a representative from Dover-Kohl and Partners presented a workshop to the city commission regarding the future direction of the town center. As a result of this workshop, the city commission directed staff to prepare revisions to the Town Center Code that would incorporate the ideas of the transect into the Town Center District Code. The transect categorizes settlement patterns into "zones" that range from areas with a very rural character to a very urban character. 
    Review standards for the town center are derived from a number of sources in planning literature. Where approvals, interpretations and judgments are left to the discretion of city officials, these officials shall use the following texts for guidance as to best practices:

(b)  This division repeals the Town Center Overlay Zoning District Regulations of June 9, 1997 (Ordinance No. 661) and September 8, 1997 (Ordinance No. 676).

(Ord. No. 2012-06, § 2, 3-12-12) 
Sec. 20-321. - Administration. 
(a)  Interpretation of the standards. Interpretation of the standards in this division shall be the responsibility of the city's development review committee (DRC). Unless otherwise authorized by resolution of the city commission, the city commission shall serve as the development review committee under this division. The adopted Master Plan (inclusive of any economic development strategies adopted by the city commission for the town center) shall serve as guidance to the development review committee with regard to the city's intent for land development in the town center. The images contained in this division are meant to demonstrate the character intended for the town center and shall be the guide for future development, but are for illustrative purposes only. The accompanying text and numbers are rules that govern permitted development. 
(b)  Review process. 
(1)  Applications are subject to final review and approval by the development review committee (DRC). Prior to final review and approval by the development review committee, all new applications, and proposed substantial amendments to previously approved applications, shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning board for purposes of issuing an advisory recommendation to the development review committee. 
    The committee shall have authority, within reason and applicable rules, for approving all aspects of site planning and exterior architecture, including aesthetic appropriateness, verification of an acceptable economic fiscal impact, environmental implications, traffic impacts, and any other site-specific matters not delineated herein. 
(2)  Optional preliminary review. Applicants may, at their option and sole cost and risk, submit site layout and building elevation designs in schematic or sketch form to the development review committee for a non-binding and preliminary review as an initial courtesy to the applicant. These submittals are subject to a more formal application process which requires the submission of more detailed plans and specifications and requires a more detailed review and final consideration of approval by the DRC. Comments and statements made by city officials at the preliminary review are non-binding unless memorialized in a written agreement approved by the city commission. City staff and the applicant shall only seek feedback from the commission and city staff shall not make a formal recommendation regarding the proposed project at this time, unless the application is accompanied by a written development agreement being proposed by city staff for the commission's approval. In which case, the city staff shall make a recommendation regarding the application and proposed agreement. This non-binding and preliminary review shall not be relied upon by the applicant as a final decision and shall not be construed in any manner as creating any vested right or entitlement for the development of the subject property. By requesting and participating in the optional preliminary review process, the applicant shall be deemed to have read and agreed to this code provision and to hold the city and its officials harmless for any future actions they may have taken based on the results of a preliminary review pursuant to this section. 
(3)  Applicants shall submit the following items to the community development department for review: 
a.  A current up-to-date site survey; 
b.  A current up-to-date tree survey; 
c.  A site plan, drawn to scale, which shall indicate: 
1.  Building locations and orientations, and landscape areas; 
2.  Parking locations and number of spaces; 
3.  Paved surfaces, materials and location(s); 
4.  Site location diagram and legal description; and 
5.  Signage. 
d.  Building elevations illustrating all sides of structures facing public streets or spaces; 
e.  A parking analysis justifying the proposed parking solution (such as Shared Parking, by Barton Aschman Associates, The Urban Land Institute); 
f.  An economic fiscal impact report, prepared by a duly qualified expert, in compliance with the requirements set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan and Code, if applicable; and 
g.  Other reasonable supporting documents to indicate intentions and/or any other items reasonably required by the development review committee to determine whether or not the proposed development is in compliance with the City's Comprehensive Plan and Code. 
    The provisions of this subsection are not applicable to the optional preliminary review process, but some or all of the requirements may be required by the city, on a case-by-case basis, if the city and the applicant pursue a development agreement during the optional preliminary review process. 
(c)  Special exceptions. 
(1)  The city commission may by special exception waive strict compliance with provisions of this code in furtherance of promoting the town center policies adopted by the city. In granting a special exception, the city commission must find by substantial competent evidence that: 
a.  The proposed development contributes to, promotes and encourages the improvement of the Winter Springs Town Center and catalyzes other development as envisioned in the Winter Springs Town Center regulations. 
b.  The proposed development will not have an unfavorable effect on the economy of the Winter Springs Town Center and complies with the economic fiscal impact requirements set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan and Code. 
c.  The proposed development abides by all rules in this code other than those specially excepted. Special limitations apply to large footprint buildings (greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet); see subsection 20-324(9) for these limitations. 
d.  The proposed development meets any reasonable additional conditions, restrictions or limitations deemed necessary by the city commission in order to preserve and promote the intent of the Winter Springs Town Center District Code. 
e.  With respect to each waiver requested, the specific waiver shall comply with all of the following: 
1.  Is a result of special conditions and circumstances which are peculiar to the land, site plan, structure or building involved and which justify granting the waiver in the context of the overall proposed development being successful within the town center; 
2.  Is the minimum waiver from the town center regulations necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
3.  Is in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the town center regulations; 
4.  Will not be injurious or incompatible to the town center and any surrounding neighborhood or property; and 
5.  Will not create a public nuisance or be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare relative to public services including water, sewer, surface water management, police, fire, parks and recreation, streets and traffic patterns, public transportation, marina and water ways, bicycle and pedestrian facilities. 
(2)  Procedure for special exceptions . 
a.  Approval may be granted only after a minimum of two (2) discretionary reviews. The first review shall be before the planning and zoning board, at which time the planning and zoning board shall review the project and provide to the city commission an advisory recommendation regarding approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The second review shall be a public hearing held before the city commission and shall be held no sooner than seven (7) calendar days following the planning and zoning board hearing. 
b.  Requests for special exceptions under this division shall include each exhibit required in the administration review process per subsection 20-321(b). In addition, the city commission may within reason require additional exhibits and may defer approval of the special exception application or schedule an additional public hearing or hearings to review those exhibits. 
c.  Special exceptions shall not be unreasonably withheld if the requested special exception complies with the applicable criteria set forth in the town center regulations, but the city commission shall have authority to require that the applicant satisfy any additional conditions it deems necessary to fulfill goals of the master plan, including reasonable offsite improvements directly related and proportionate to the specific impact of the request, or further review(s) and approval by the development review committee. 
(3)  The city commission may grant the approval of an application for special exceptions from the Code in whole or in part upon a majority vote of its members. 
(d)  Site development agreement option. The city may enter into a site development agreement with the user or developer of a property, relating to development of a particular parcel or tract of land, and such an agreement may address such issues as impact fee credits; a specialized or negotiated concept of design or site plan development authorized or sanctioned by this division; infrastructure service credits or public-private participation in funding, design or construction; or other incentives based upon strict compliance with requirements of this ordinance. The agreement will be mutually acceptable to all parties. Considerations for the city in deciding whether to participate in such an agreement will include compliance with the objectives and design criteria specified in this division; demonstration of a cost benefit to city and developer; consideration of development amenities provided by the developer. Such a site development agreement shall be adopted and be in conformance with the requirements of the Florida Municipal Home Rule Powers Act or F.S. §§ 163.3220 through 163.4243, as to effect, duration, public hearing requirements and other issues. 
    The terms and conditions set forth in a development agreement and any related final engineering plans ("development agreement") approved by the city commission shall be binding on the subject property regardless of any changes to the Town Center Code. In the event that the Town Center Code is amended after a development agreement is approved to permit development that is inconsistent and in conflict with a previously approved development agreement, the terms and conditions of the development agreement shall prevail, unless the development agreement is amended. The intent of this paragraph is to prohibit a developer from relying upon an amendment to the Town Center Code enacted subsequent to approval of its development project in order to alter the terms and conditions of its project without the express written consent of the city commission. 
    In the town center district, decorative street signs are required along roadways as part of the decorative street sign and light program for new development including: subdivisions, commercial development and areas constructed for public use. Standards for the town center district follow the same guidelines as street signage that is upgraded in all other areas of the city. In addition, the city requires that decorative street lights be provided for all development within the town center district. During the development review process, it will be determined by the city whether or not the user or developer of a property within the town center may need to enter into a Neighborhood Street Sign Light Improvement Agreement (NSSLIA) as part of the respective development agreement. 
(e)  Comprehensive plan compliance required. All development of property subject to these regulations shall also be subject to the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Winter Springs, Florida, and all approvals and land development permits shall be in compliance with said comprehensive plan.

Main Street (Tuscawilla Road): Winter Springs Town Center 
(Ord. No. 2012-06, § 2, 3-12-12; Ord. No. 2014-09, § 2, 4-28-14; Ord. No. 2016-07, § 2, 4-11-16; Ord. No. 2016-07, § 2(Exh. A), 4-11-16 
Sec. 20-324. - General provisions. 
    The following general provisions apply to all street types. 
(1)  Corner radii and clear zones. Corner curb radii shall be between nine (9) feet and fifteen (15) feet, with the following permitted exceptions: 1) where a curb radius must be larger in order to meet the minimum requirements to obtain a required permit from another agency (FDOT, Seminole County, etc.); and 2) where the fire marshal has determined that a larger curb radius must be provided. Fairly tight turning radii shorten pedestrian crossings and inhibit reckless drivers from turning corners at high speeds. To allow for emergency vehicles (e.g., fire trucks) to turn corners, a twenty-five-foot radius clear zone shall be established free of all vertical obstructions including but not limited to telephone poles, sign poles, fire hydrants, electrical boxes, or newspaper boxes. 

(2)  Alleys. Alleys are required in the T4 and T5 zones of the town center to minimize curb cuts and to provide access to parking and service areas behind buildings. Alleys are not required in the T3 zone in cases when lot widths are greater than fifty (50) feet. In these cases, a front-loaded garage can be utilized, provided it is setback at least twenty (20) feet behind the principle plane of the primary building. Alley locations and dimensions are not fixed but shall be designed to accommodate the alley's purpose. Additional curb cuts shall be added only with the permission of the development review committee. Alleys may be incorporated into parking lots as drive aisles and fire lanes. In general alleys are intended to accommodate services including but not limited to parking, trash pickup, loading docks, and drive-throughs. 
(3)  Exceptions from build-to lines (front setbacks). Exceptions from build-to lines as noted in each transect zone may be granted by the development review committee for avoiding trees with diameter breast height (dbh) greater than eight (8) inches. 
    On corner sites (within fifty (50) feet of the corner) with build-to lines set back from the property line, building frontage may be positioned forward of the build-to line up to the property line, provided it does not encroach upon the clear zone. 
(4)  Diversity of building widths. No more than three (3) detached residential buildings twenty (20) feet or less in width are permitted within any two hundred (200) feet of frontage. 
(5)  Accessory structures. Accessory structures are permitted and may contain parking, accessory dwelling units, home occupation uses, storage space, and trash receptacles. Home occupation uses are restricted to owner plus one (1) employee, shall not include noxious or disruptive functions, and may not disrupt parking for neighboring residents. Accessory structures shall not be greater than six hundred twenty-five (625) square feet in footprint and shall not exceed two (2) stories in height. 
(6)  Drive-throughs. Drive-through service windows are only permitted in the rear in and alley accessed locations provided they do not substantially disrupt pedestrian activity or surrounding uses. 


(7)  Civic sites. Civic buildings and sites contain uses of special public importance. Civic buildings include, but are not limited to, municipal buildings, churches, libraries, schools, daycare centers, recreation facilities, and places of assembly. Civic buildings do not include retail buildings, residential buildings, or privately owned office buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a special architectural statement, civic buildings are not subject to build-to line requirements or building frontage requirements. Civic sites include Central Winds Park and Wetlands Park. The design of civic buildings and sites shall be subject to review and approval by the development review committee and are permitted in any transect zone within the town center but primarily in the "civic/public" zone. 
(8)  Parking. 
a.  Parking requirements. The intent of these parking regulations is to encourage a balance between compact pedestrian oriented development and necessary car storage. The goal is to construct neither more nor less parking than is needed. 
There shall be no minimum parking requirement in the town center. The applicant shall provide a parking analysis justifying the proposed parking solution. The level of detail required for the parking analysis shall be determined in consultation with the DRC early-on in the development process. In general, the parking analysis shall include a detailed analysis and calculation of the normal and peak parking demands for a development. The usage of standard parking generation rates is normally not acceptable for this purpose. The best source of data is field parking counts from similar developments in the area. Factors to consider when calculating the overall parking demand include, but are not limited to: 
 Size and usage of the development/number of units 
 Availability and proximity of mass transit 
 Demographics of the expected user group 
 Availability and expected use of bicycle and pedestrian facilities 
 Surrounding land use 
Factors to consider when determining the number of parking spaces to be provided include, but are not limited to: 
 Number of parking spaces to be reserved and/or restricted 
 Availability and proximity of overflow parking areas 
 Mix of the type of parking spaces available, including private garages, private driveways, public surface parking, public on-street parking, metered parking, etc. 
 Management strategies for the usage of visitor/overflow parking spaces 
 Opportunity to share parking with surrounding properties 
Enclosed garages in individual residential units are often not used to their full parking capacity. In recognition of this, the number of parking spaces considered to be available in enclosed garages shall be calculated at fifty (50) percent of the actual parking capacity. For example, a two-car garage would be considered to have 1.0 parking spaces, and a one-car garage would have 0.5 parking spaces. 
Minimum parking space dimensions for head-in or diagonal parking shall be nine (9) feet × eighteeen (18) feet with eleven-foot drive lanes (twenty-two (22) feet for two-way traffic) and parallel parking spaces shall be eight (8) feet × twenty (20) feet minimum with ten-foot drive lanes (twenty (20) feet for two-way traffic). 
Parking shall be provided as necessary to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction. 
b.  On-street parking. The selection of diagonal or parallel parking along any section of road shall be determined in consultation with DRC. In the event that the DRC approves diagonal instead of parallel parking, dimensions should be pursuant to section 20-325(c). 
c.  Off-street surface parking lot placement. Off-street surface parking lots shall be set back a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the property line along the main street to accommodate liner buildings. The DRC shall have discretion to make this requirement applicable elsewhere on prominent frontages, such as along key pedestrian connections, within significant vistas and within important public spaces. Outbuildings serving as garages facing alleys shall be permitted within this setback. This dimension may be reduced to thirty-five (35) feet in cases where liner buildings are being constructed concurrently with an off-street surface parking lot. 
d.  Structured parking lot placement. Parking structures shall be set back a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the property lines of all adjacent streets to reserve room for liner buildings between parking structures or other structures with blank walls and the lot frontage. This distance will vary dependent upon the architecture of the liner building. The liner building shall be no less than two (2) stories in height or a height sufficient to buffer the entire height of the parking structure from the right-of-way. Liner buildings may be detached from or attached to parking structures. The setback dimension may be reduced in cases where liner buildings are being constructed concurrently with a structured parking facility, but in no case shall this dimension be less than thirty-five (35) feet. 


e.  Access to off-street parking. Alleys shall be the primary source of access to off-street parking. Parking along alleys may be head-in, diagonal or parallel. 
Alleys may be incorporated into parking lots as standard drive aisles. Access to all properties adjacent to the alley shall be maintained. Access between parking lots across property lines is also encouraged. Corner lots that have both rear and side access shall access parking through the rear. 

Circular drives are prohibited except for civic buildings. 
In the T4 and T5 districts, garage door(s) shall be positioned no closer to streets, squares or parks than twenty (20) feet behind the principal plane of the building frontage. Garage doors facing streets, squares or parks shall not exceed ten (10) feet in width. Where space permits, garage doors shall face the side or the rear, not the front. 

f.  Parking lot landscaping requirements. 

Landscape strips of at least six (6) feet in width shall be provided between parking isles of either head-in or diagonal parking. 
Tree spacing in parking lots shall be determined by the city arborist based upon tree species and location. The objective is to create as continuous a shade canopy as possible. 
A diversity of tree species across the town center is encouraged. To minimize water consumption, the use of low-water vegetative ground cover other than turf is encouraged. 

Undesirable large footprint buildings have blank facades and sit behind a field of parking. 
In lieu of landscape strips, landscape islands can be provided. No more than six (6) consecutive parking stalls are permitted without a landscape island of at least six (6) feet in width and extending the entire length of the parking stall. A minimum of one (1) tree shall be planted in each landscape island. 
(9)  Large footprint buildings. Buildings with a footprint greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet may be built within the town center district by special exception only. In these cases, the maximum lot width as noted in each applicable transect zone will be waived. Such buildings must abide by all rules in this division with the following special limitations: 

Undesirable large footprint buildings have blank facades and sit behind a field of parking. 

Desirable large footprint buildings are wrapped in a liner of smaller buildings with doors and windows facing the street. 
a.  To encourage use by pedestrians and decrease the need for solely auto-oriented patronage, large-footprint buildings must reinforce the urban character of the town center and shall therefore continue a connected system of walkable street frontages. 
b.  Loading docks, service areas and trash disposal facilities shall not face streets, parks, squares or significant pedestrian spaces. 
(10)  Additional prohibitions. The following are prohibited where visible from parks, squares and primary streets: 
a.  Utility boxes and machinery, including but not limited to: backflow devices, electric meters and air conditioning units. 
(11)  Maximum block size. A block is noted by this Code as an increment of land composed of an aggregate of lots, tracts and alleys circumscribed by thoroughfares. The maximum block size permitted by this Code is a perimeter of one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet, with no individual block face being more than six hundred (600) feet in length. Special exceptions may be approved by the DRC on a case-by-case basis from this provision where circumstances including structured parking among other things are constructed in the block. 
    Fronts and backs orientation of buildings and lots relative to the frontage line: 
a.  Buildings and lots have fronts, sides, and rears. 
b.  Thoroughfares, with the exception of rear alleys and rear lanes, should be faced with the fronts and sides of buildings and lots. 
c.  Rear alleys, rear lanes and mid-block parking areas should be faced with the backs of sides of buildings and lots. 

(12)  Building height. Cupolas, spires, domes, pinnacles, chimneys, penthouses and similar architectural features may be erected to a height greater than any limit prescribed in this Code provided, each feature does not exceed six hundred (600) square feet in area and does not extend more than thirty (30) feet above the designated height limit for each transect zone. Building height is measured as the vertical distance from the lowest point on the tallest side of the structure to the top of the cornice, eave or similar architectural feature.

Pentagon Row, VA 
    Internally lit plastic signs are designed for high speed "strip" centers, not a pedestrian oriented town center. 

    The intent of regulating signs that are visible from the public frontage is to ensure proper dimensioning and placement with respect to existing or planned architectural features, to maintain or improve public safety, to maintain or improve the aesthetic character of the context in which they are located, and to provide legible information for pedestrians, not just drivers. 

    Signs shall be flat against the facade, mounted projecting from the facade, or mounted above the top of the facade. Free standing monument signs are permitted by special exception along State Road 434 frontage. 
    Temporary menu board signs are permitted subject to the restrictions and uniform design standards set forth in this Town Center Code. 
    Wayfinding signage is encouraged, but must maintain the uniform design standards adopted by the DRC for the town center. 
    Signs shall be externally lit. Individual letters and symbols may be internally lit or back-lit and may project no more than twelve (12) inches from the facade. 

Front lit metal lettering from facade gives depth to the signage. 
(b)  Finish materials. 
 Wood: painted or natural 
 Metal: copper, brass, galvanized steel, aluminum 
 Painted canvas 
 Neon 
 Paint/engraved directly on facade surface 
(c)  Configurations . Maximum gross area of signs on a given facade shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the applicant's facade area. 
    Maximum area of any single sign mounted perpendicular to a given facade shall not exceed ten (10) square feet, except for FIN signs. All projecting signs shall be installed in such a manner that there shall be no visible angle iron support structure above a roof, building face or wall, unless such brackets are incorporated into the signage as decorative elements of the signage. 
    Signs shall maintain a minimum clear height above sidewalks of eight (8) feet. 
    All signs shall be designed to be compatible with the respective storefront and subject building in scale, proportion, and color and should be visually interesting and compatible in the context of the town center guidelines. 

Signs include a variety of font styles and are centered above the entrance. Cliff Rose Drive, Winter Springs Town Center 
    Marquee signs shall be mounted substantially parallel with the face of the canopy or marquee but shall not be located in such a way as to cause a reduction in the minimum clearance standards set forth in section 20-326. In addition, marquee signs shall not extend more than two (2) feet above the canopy or marquee to which it is attached and shall be consistent with section 327.1(d)(5). 
    Menu board signs are temporary accessory signs which display information about the goods and services of adjacent business that customarily have frequent walk in traffic such as eating and drinking establishments and light retail businesses. A maximum of one (1) menu board sign shall be allowed per business frontage. 
    Menu signs shall be utilized only during regular business hours and shall be removed during non-business hours and during serious incidents of inclement weather that may destabilize the menu board. 

Naples, FL 
    Menu boards may be placed on private property or within the public right-of-way, provided they do not interfere with vehicle access, pedestrian movement, or wheel chair access to, through, and around the site. At least six (6) feet of clear sidewalk width must remain for pedestrian traffic. The total sign area per face shall not exceed six (6) square feet.

Fin signs shall be between fifteen (15) square feet and twenty-five (25) square feet in area, but shall not extend more than five (5) feet from the building wall. All fin signs shall be installed in such a manner that there shall be no visible angle iron support structure above a roof, building face or wall unless such brackets are incorporated into the signage as decorative elements of the signage. 

Reston, VA 
Examples of Signs Mounted Flat Against the Facade: 
The top edge of the facade is shaped to create a special focal spot for the sign. 

The sign is centered within the symmetrical arrangement of the window above and shopfront below and has internally lit letters. 


The sign runs horizontally along the expression line and has internally lit letters. 
Sign painted directly on the facade above the main entrance with external lighting discreetly located above the awning. The variety in font size and style give added interest. 
Examples of Signs Mounted Projecting from the Facade: 

Neon signs can provide a warm glow, enhancing night time pedestrian activity. 
Vertical projecting signs are highly visible far down the street. A lower awning sign caters to people on foot and in cars passing directly in front of the venue. 


Sign painted on the face of a canvas awning over entry and lit discreetly by external lighting. 

  
Signs hanging from the ceilings of arcades command the attention of pedestrian shoppers. 
Examples of Signs Mounted Above the Top of the Facade: 
Signs projecting from the tops of buildings are highly visible from a great distance. 

Projecting signs which break the skyline are visible from a variety of distances and serve as beacons to customers when lit at night. 

Signs projecting above the roof stand out against the sky, adding an architectural flair to a shop's identity. This distinctive sign, made of individual letters projecting from the front of the facade and extending above the cornice line, is memorable to shoppers and is highly visible from many directions. 
A second lower sign marks the entrance to the store.

DIVISION 13. - GREENEWAY INTERCHANGE ZONING DISTRICT[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-10, §§ 2, 3, repealed former Div. 13, §§ 20-328-20-336, 20-338-20-341, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Div. 13 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 725, 8-23-99; Ord. No. 2005-18, § 3, 7-11-05; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 4-26-10. 

Sec. 20-328. - Purpose. 
    In general, the purpose of the Greeneway Interchange Zoning District ("district") is to implement the specific City Comprehensive Plan provisions related to the district. More specifically, the district is intended to be predominantly a high quality corporate business/office park development that is master planned. It is intended to serve as a unique and very important economic catalyst for the City that attracts target industries with high quality and higher income jobs that promote economic growth and development within the City. High quality building and development that enhances the image and economic well-being of the City is expected in the district. Residential and incidental commercial uses may be permitted under certain conditions in support of existing or concurrently developed target industries located within the district. However, residential and incidental commercials uses are not a priority nor shall they be allowed as stand-alone uses. The district is intended to be oriented at and near S.R. 417 and S.R. 434 so the district is easily accessible from major transportation corridors. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-329. - General uses and intensities. 
(a)  General uses. The district is intended to be a master planned area that is developed in phases approved by the City. Land uses within the district shall be limited to target industry uses that create significant high average wage employment opportunities including corporate business parks, office complexes, technical and research services, financial information services, life sciences, digital media, international trade, sports associated industries, hotels and lodging, conference centers and long stay tourism. Incidental commercial uses supportive of target industries may be incorporated into target industry buildings provided the incidental uses are approved by the City and are not developed as a separate facility. Multi-family residential uses may be approved as a conditional use, provided that the proposed use satisfies the conditional use criteria set forth in the City Code and the residential use shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total floor area of a proposed multiple use building in any approved phase of the district master plan. 
(b)  Development intensities. The following building intensity limits shall apply: 
(1)  Floor area ratio (FAR) shall not exceed 1.0. However, the city commission may permit a FAR greater than 1.0, but not exceeding 2.0, for projects that create compact mixed use development through one or more of the following principles consistent with the City's land development policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and Code: 
(i)  Implementation of environmentally sensitive site planning concepts and techniques. 
(ii)  Utilize traditional design standards to create compact, multimodal mixed-use (including horizontal and vertical integration of uses) and neo-traditional urban development. 
(iii)  Green building design including energy efficient buildings as determined by any nationally recognized and adopted standard. 
(iv)  Incorporation of low impact development (LID) practices such as shared parking concepts, green roofs and use of stormwater for irrigation and/or other grey water type uses, and rain gardens. 
(v)  Energy efficient land use which minimizes impervious services, such as inclusion of one or more parking garages. 
(vi)  Restoration or enhancement of degraded wetlands, native ecosystems, or preservation of extra upland buffers around critical habitat. 
(vii)  Implementation of water wise practices including sustainable site design through natural landscaping with Florida native plants. 
In addition, the city commission may approve a FAR above 1.0 for a project that the city commission determines, by development agreement, has a projected significant positive economic impact that will optimize and diversify the City's economic tax base consistent with the intent and purpose of this division. 
Any increase in the FAR approved by the city commission above 1.0 shall have a reasonable nexus to an enhanced environmental or economic benefit to the City and the increase shall be roughly proportional to the enhanced economic and environmental benefit that the project has on the City. 
(2)  Multi-family residential uses may be allowed by conditional use permit approved by the city commission up to a maximum density of twenty-one (21) units per acre, provided the residential use shall not occupy more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total floor area (parking garages are excluded from the calculation) of a proposed multiple use building in any approved phase of the district master plan. Specific density shall be determined based on the conditional use criteria stated in the Code and whether the development satisfies the economic and fiscal impact requirements of this division and is consistent with the intent and purpose of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14)

    All buildings shall be a minimum two (2) stories in height of occupiable space (as defined by the Florida Building Code, Chapter 2). However, ancillary buildings may be excluded from the two story minimum by development agreement approved by the City Commission, provided the ancillary building is consistent with the intent and purpose of the district. The city commission, by conditional use permit, may approve a principal building that is less than two stories in height. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-332. - Setbacks. 
    Unless otherwise expressly required by the City's Comprehensive Plan, this division or other applicable law, there shall be no minimum setbacks in the district. However, the location, size, dimensions and design of yards, buildings, structures, and other infrastructure and facilities shall be determined as part of the master plan process and by development agreement. Setbacks shall generally be determined based on factors such as intensity and design of the proposed use, public pedestrian and vehicular safety, environmental concerns, compatibility of surrounding and on-site uses and facilities, and connectivity of proposed development phases within the district. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-333. - Parking and driveway requirements. 
    The parking and driveway requirements for the Town Center set forth in section 20-324(8) shall apply in the district. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-334. - Utility lines, pipes, conduit and infrastructure. 
(a)  All new and relocated utility infrastructure shall be constructed and installed underground to the maximum extent feasible and possible consistent with law and industry standards. All new or relocated utility lines, pipes, conduit and similar infrastructure within the district shall be constructed and installed beneath the surface of the ground unless the City determines that soil, topographical, or any other compelling site condition makes undergrounding unreasonable and impracticable. 
(b)  Incidental utility appurtenances including transformer boxes, switch boxes, and pedestal mounted boxes shall not be required to be constructed and installed underground. However, such appurtenances shall be constructed and installed at locations approved by the City with maximum consideration given to visual screening, buffering, and other aesthetic and practical on and off-site visual and safety considerations. Such appurtenances shall be set back a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from any right-of-way. Visual screening techniques shall include landscape materials and masonry constructions. 
(c)  Easements shall be required for the construction and installation of all utility infrastructure unless the utility determines that an easement is not needed to secure permission to use the property on which the infrastructure is installed. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-335. - Interconnectivity of multiple parcels. 
    In order to effectuate the master planning of the district involving multiple development parcels of land, property owners shall be required to provide internal connection between their respective parcels for rights-of-way, access and shared parking purposes unless the City determines that internal connection is not practicable or feasible based on parcel constraints or undue hardship. Upon approval of the City, interconnectivity may be achieved by conveying public rights-of-way and cross access easements to the City or easements and perpetual real property covenants between connecting parcel owners. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-336. - Development agreement; icon monument sign. 
(a)  Due to the unique nature of the district and the master plan requirements, development phases and projects approved under this division shall be subject to a written development agreement unless the city commission waives the requirement for good cause shown. The agreement may address such issues as impact fee credits; economic development incentives; a specialized or negotiated concept of design or site plan development authorized or sanctioned by this division; infrastructure service credits or public-private participation in funding, design or construction; or other incentives and terms allowed by law. All development agreements approved under this section shall be adopted and be in conformance with the requirements of the Florida Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, or F.S. §§ 163.3220 through 163.4243, as to effect, duration, public hearing requirements and other issues. 
The terms and conditions set forth in a development agreement and any related final engineering plans approved by the city commission shall be binding on the subject property regardless of any changes to this division. In the event that this division is amended after a development agreement is approved to permit development that is inconsistent and in conflict with a previously approved development agreement, the terms and conditions of the development agreement shall prevail, unless the development agreement is amended. The intent of this paragraph is to prohibit a developer from relying upon an amendment to this division enacted subsequent to approval of its development project or phase in order to alter the terms and conditions of its project or phase without the express written consent of the city commission. Further, the city commission may waive the technical and design standards required by this division by development agreement. 
(b)  The City contemplates that the district will have one large "Icon Monument Sign" to be located generally located along the western boundary of S.R. 417 and clearly visible by north and south bound vehicular traffic using S.R. 417. The intent and purpose of the Icon Monument Sign is to showcase and identify the district and its target industries as a unique and very important business commerce area of the City. At the City's discretion, such sign may be constructed, installed, and maintained by the City or negotiated with a developer and/or property owner pursuant to the terms and conditions of a development agreement. The Icon Monument Sign shall meet general applicable sign standards adopted by the City, permit electronic digital displays, and may also permit, within the monument, the storage and concealment of telecommunication and other utility equipment for the benefit of the district and City. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-337. - Master development plan. 
    The district is intended to be planned and developed as a unified whole over a period of years. The various parcels of land within the district are also required to be interconnected to provide continuity and compatibility among the various land uses and to create a compact and walkable workplace. In furtherance of this intent and requirement, the district shall be developed in accordance with a master plan approved by the City consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and Code. The master plan shall serve as the fundamental and underlying guide for future phased development of the district. Each phase shall be consistent with the master plan approved by the City. In the event a proposed phase necessitates a modification to the master plan, the developer proposing the phase shall be required to demonstrate the need and benefit of the proposed modification to the master plan in conjunction with the proposed phase. All phases shall be consistent with the master plan and the intent and purpose of this division. Modifications to the master plan shall not cause any conflict with or adversely affect any existing or permitted phase. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-338. - Optional preliminary review. 
    Developers may, at their option and sole cost and risk, submit site layout and building elevation designs in schematic or sketch form to the City for a non-binding and preliminary review as an initial courtesy to the developer. These submittals are subject to a more formal application process (including, but not limited to, approval of final concept plans and preliminary and final engineering) which requires the submission of more detailed plans and specifications and requires a more detailed review and final consideration of approval by the city commission by development agreement. Comments and statements made by city officials at the optional preliminary review are non-binding unless memorialized in a written agreement approved by the city commission. City staff and the applicant shall only seek feedback from the commission and city staff shall not make a final recommendation regarding the proposed project or phase at this time, unless the application is accompanied by a written development agreement being proposed by city staff for the commission's approval. In which case, the city staff shall make a recommendation regarding the application and proposed agreement. This non-binding and preliminary review shall not be relied upon by the developer or property owner as a final decision and shall not be construed in any manner as creating any vested right or entitlement for the development of the subject property. By requesting and participating in the optional preliminary review process, the developer and property owner shall be deemed to have read and agreed to this code provision and to hold the City and its officials harmless for any future actions they may have taken based on the results of a preliminary review pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 2014-10, § 3, 7-28-14) 
Sec. 20-339. - Economic and fiscal impact requirements. 
(a)  All development proposals within the district shall be subject to an economic and fiscal impact review pursuant to Policies 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  The developer shall be required to submit an economic and fiscal impact report to the City as a condition of approval of any proposed phase or project. The report shall be prepared by a duly qualified expert and supported by data and analysis or the developer may choose to submit an application to use the City's economic and fiscal impact model pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this section. In either case, the report shall detail the associated economic and fiscal impacts of any proposed phase or project on the City and the School District and shall be used to determine compliance with the criteria set forth in subsection (c). While the report may address regional economic and fiscal impacts, if any, the report must predominantly address the economic and fiscal impacts on the City as its own economic system. The report must address the impacts of the prosed project or phase on jobs, economic output, and wages. The fiscal impact analysis must address the net fiscal impact of the proposed phase or project on the City over a period of years. Net fiscal impact shall be calculated as the sum of those revenues (such as ad valorem taxes, public service taxes, sales taxes, and charges for service) directly received by the City minus the sum of expenditures incurred by the City (such as general government expenses, law enforcement, roads, and parks and recreation). 
(c)  No development order shall be issued for any proposed phase or project until such time the city commission determines, based on competent and substantial evidence, that the proposed phase or project satisfies the following criteria: 
(1)  The proposed land use and intensity (or density) is permitted under this division; 
(2)  Market demand for the proposed phase is minimally feasible based on market data; and 
(3)  The proposed phase or project optimally increases and diversifies the City's tax base and economic well-being. 
    For purposes of this section, the term "optimally increases" shall mean that the economic and fiscal impact of the proposed phase or project is the best result obtainable for the City under current economic and land use conditions. For purposes of evaluating the best result under current land use conditions, the report shall be prepared in the context of whether the proposed development phase or project is consistent with existing or proposed uses in the district, the intent and purpose of the district, and compatible with surrounding land uses. Additionally, the term "diversifies" means the extent that the proposed development phase or project reduces the City's reliance upon a residential tax base to fund the City's fiscal budget. 
    In furtherance of evaluating compliance with the criteria set forth in this section, the report shall analyze and compare the proposed development phase or project to either the City's preferred development phase or project for the subject property as may be expressly stated in the master plan or applicable economic development study conducted by the City for the district, or if the City does not have a preferred development phase or project or applicable study, the proposed phase or project shall be compared with a reasonable array of other potential alternative compatible projects authorized by this division. 
(d)  In lieu of submitting a report by a duly qualified expert, the developer may submit an application to use the City's adopted economic and fiscal impact model for Town Center and Greeneway Interchange projects. The application shall be submitted with the applicable application fee and on a form prepared by the community development department. Along with the application, the developer shall be required to also submit all of the necessary input data and variables which are deemed necessary for the City to prepare one or more versions of a report generated from the model for the proposed development project or phase. Notwithstanding any report generated pursuant to this subsection, the developer may also submit an economic and fiscal impact report from a duly qualified expert if the developer desires to contest the findings and conclusions reached from the City's model.

Sec. 20-340. - Comprehensive plan and code compliance required. 
    All development of property subject to this division shall also be subject to the Comprehensive Plan and other applicable Code provisions of the City of Winter Springs, Florida, and all approvals and land development permits shall be in compliance therewith.

ARTICLE IV. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2011-02, § 2, adopted May 9, 2011, repealed former Art. IV, §§ 20-351-20-362, 20-376-20-389, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 367, § 1, 5-11-87; Ord. No. 2006-19, § 2, 11-13-06; Ord. No. 2007-29, § 2, 12-10-07; 2010-08, § 5, 10-25-10. 

Sec. 20-351. - Intent and purpose of district. 
    The intent and purpose of the planned unit development ("PUD") district are to accomplish, through a master plan with an appropriate mix of uses, a more desirable environment and efficient land use pattern than would be possible through a strict application of Euclidian zoning, while adhering to the provisions of the comprehensive plan and applicable federal and state regulations. The purpose of the PUD is further defined to: 
(a)  Allow a more flexible management structure for the efficient, orderly, and sustainable integration of uses, consistent with and complementary to their context within the community; 
(b)  Create a greater sense of place, community, and neighborhood identity, through superlative urban design and innovation; 
(c)  Provide a development plan that is compatible with and complements the surrounding community, creating a safe inviting environment, a sense of place, and neighborhood cohesiveness; 
(d)  Maintain, enhance, and preserve salient or otherwise significant existing natural features, by identifying these features and designing the project to incorporate them as view-sheds, terminating vistas, focal points, and/or other scenic amenities; 
(e)  Provide the greatest choice of realistic, safe, functional, interconnected, and convenient multi-modal transportation options within the PUD and with the surrounding areas; 
(f)  Limit urban sprawl, greenhouse gas emissions, stormwater runoff, and vehicle miles traveled; 
(g)  Provide economically efficient means for delivery of government services and infrastructure; 
(h)  Provide a mix of housing designed in pedestrian scale neighborhood unit increments; 
(i)  Incorporate energy and water efficient land use patterns and technologies beyond the minimums required by state law or the Florida Building Code; 
(j)  Promote positive interaction among and between uses and, where residential is included, the use of residential housing types that could not readily be accomplished through Euclidean zoning; 
(k)  Incorporate crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) principles compatible with the pedestrian-oriented design; and 
(l)  Further the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 2011-02, § 2, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 20-352. - Development Agreement and Master Plan. 
(a)  Development agreement. The PUD zoning district requires the review, approval, execution and recording of a development agreement between the applicant and city commission. No site work, other than that normally associated with surveying and soil boring, may be initiated prior to recordation of such development agreement, although demolition of structures, wells, and/or septic systems or hazardous materials cleanups may be permitted if not otherwise prohibited by this Code. 
(b)  Master plan. The PUD zoning district additionally requires the review and approval of a master plan which is approved as an exhibit to or by reference in a development agreement. 
(c)  Amendments. Proposed amendments to an approved development agreement shall be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the approved development agreement. Proposed amendments to an approved master plan shall be considered an amendment to the approved development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2011-02, § 2, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 20-353. - Standards for planned unit developments. 
(a)  Unified control. At the time of application, all properties within a proposed PUD shall be under unified ownership or control, as demonstrated by appropriate legal documents submitted by the applicant. These documents shall be reviewed for and are subject to a determination of legal sufficiency by the City Attorney. 
(b)  Minimum size. The minimum parcel size for a PUD is ten (10) acres. All proposed developments which contain at least fifty (50) developable acres inclusive of wetlands proposed to be mitigated, except developments proposed to be located within the Town Center or Greeneway Interchange zoning districts, shall be located within a PUD zoning district. 
(c)  Permissible uses, density, and intensity. Permissible uses within the PUD shall be established within the development agreement consistent with the underlying future land use designation(s) identified on the future land use map of the comprehensive plan. There shall be at least two (2) different uses within a new PUD, and at least one (1) of the uses shall be a non-residential use. Nothing herein shall be construed to abrogate specific use restrictions set forth in this Code including the restrictions set forth in Chapter 20, Article V, Supplemental District Regulations. Home occupations shall be permitted within the PUD subject to the provisions of Chapter 20 and are not required to be established within the development agreement. Schools and daycare centers shall be subject to conditional use permit requirements under the City Code. 
(d)  Maximum density and intensity of development. The density and intensity of development within the PUD zoning district shall be established within the development agreement consistent with the maximum density and intensity allowed within the property's future land use designation set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(e)  Size and dimensional regulations. 
(1)  The location, size, dimensions, and design of yards, building and parking setbacks, vehicular access, loading and unloading areas, accessory structures, and utility areas (including, but not limited to, permanent areas for dumpster enclosures, utility infrastructure, stormwater management facilities, outdoor storage of vehicles, machines, and materials) shall be identified and set forth in the development agreement and master plan, and/or preliminary engineering plans for each applicable portion of the planned unit development. 
(2)  Existing PUDs. 
a.  Unless otherwise provided elsewhere in the City Code or upon a plat of record or in an active development agreement approved by the city, principal building setbacks for property zoned PUD shall be as follows: 
(i)  Front yards. The front yard shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth; 
(ii)  Rear yards. The rear yard shall not be less than ten (10) feet in depth; 
(iii)  Side yards. The side yard shall not be less than five (5) feet on each side of the dwelling structure; and 
(iv)  Corner yards. On corner lots, the front yard set back of twenty-five (25) feet must be maintained, at a minimum, on all sides abutting private or public rights-of-way. 
b.  Zero lots line. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of this subsection, zero lot line property shall be governed as follows. Unless otherwise provided elsewhere in the City Code or upon a plat of record or in an active development agreement previously approved by the city commission, the principal building setbacks for zero lot line property zoned planned unit development (PUD) shall be as follows: 
(i)  Front yards. The front yard shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth; 
(ii)  Rear yards. The rear yard shall not be less than ten (10) feet in depth;

c.  Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of this section and any declarations of covenants and restrictions governing site conditions of a PUD development within the city, the more restrictive shall apply. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of this section and any recorded development agreement approved by the city commission or court approved settlement agreement governing site conditions of a PUD development within the city, the conflicting provision in the development agreement or court approved settlement agreement shall prevail. 
(3)  New PUD developments. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting the city commission's authority to impose setback requirements greater or lesser than the minimum requirements of this section for PUD developments approved after the effective date of this section. 
(f)  Perimeter transition. 
(1)  General. The transition between existing development and the PUD shall provide a progression of complementary uses to the greatest extent reasonably possible. The goal is to encourage interconnectivity, to avoid the need for or use of walls, earthen berms, or other obstacles, and to encourage access and positive interaction and synergy among and between uses. 
(2)  Landscape buffers. If the City Commission determines that a buffer is required, the buffer shall be dedicated on the plat, if applicable, and shall be held in common ownership to ensure adequate and uniform maintenance. Any buffer plantings around the perimeter of the PUD or any portion of the PUD shall be comprised of at least seventy-five (75) percent native plant species and shall be compatible with the soil pH conditions and hydrology. 
(g)  Street dedication and public access. The provision of new private gated communities is prohibited, except to accommodate extreme circumstances of adjacent incompatibility. Adequate access among and between adjacent developments shall be provided to the greatest extent reasonably possible. Existing private streets within PUDs shall not be converted to public streets unless the streets are designed and constructed to City specifications, at minimum, and unless adequate access to adjacent properties is provided. Even where existing development is not conducive to access connection, acquiring or providing adequate emergency access is important to protect the public safety and, access shall be maximized. In new development or substantial redevelopment, emergency, pedestrian, and bicycle access shall be maximized to the extent that is reasonable, even if or when motor vehicle access cannot be expanded. Intersections within the PUD shall be designed to ensure pedestrian safety. 
(h)  Sidewalks and trails. Lighted sidewalks (a minimum of five (5) feet in width) shall be provided on both sides of the road within any new PUD or any new subdivision (or subdivision redevelopment) within an existing PUD, except that where a trail of at least eight (8) feet in width is provided in close proximity to and substantially parallel to the roadside, the trail may count for the sidewalk on that side of the roadway. Sidewalks and trails shall be planned, designed, and constructed to provide maximum safe connection to mass transit, other trails and sidewalks, as well as to schools, parks, restaurants, shopping, and other activity centers. Adequately lighted and designated pedestrian walkways shall be provided within parking lots to ensure pedestrian safety. 
(i)  Placemaking. Pedestrian-oriented block size (approximately one-quarter (1/4) mile perimeter), interconnected roadways, and building orientation toward the most prominent public spaces is required throughout a new PUD (except in industrial areas within a PUD). 
(j)  Lighting and signage. Street lighting and signage which promotes aesthetics and reinforces appropriate pedestrian-oriented streetscape design shall be incorporated throughout the PUD. On-site lighting shall retain light on-site, so that off-site light spillage is limited to not more than 0.5 foot-candles unless otherwise approved by the City Commission. Street and parking lot lighting within or adjacent to residential portions of the PUD shall be designed to be consistent with that residential development (for example, so that lights do not interfere with second or third story residential activity and light source glare is not visible from adjacent residential properties). Signage shall incorporate a common architectural and aesthetic integrity, context harmony, and theme for the PUD. Signage shall adhere to City Code specifications, except that certain signage encouraged or permitted within the town center district may be provided where appropriate within a PUD outside of the town center, subject to approval (e.g. aesthetics, dimensions, materials, colors, illumination, context, and location) by the City Commission and inclusion in the development agreement. 
(k)  Utility lines. All new or relocated utility lines shall be located underground at the developer's expense. Unshielded utility features shall not be visible from private or public rights-of-way or other public places. Placement of a utility feature in conflict with this provision in a new development or substantial redevelopment shall be relocated promptly at the developer's expense. 
(l)  Water and sewer. All new PUDs or substantial development or redevelopment in a PUD shall connect to City potable water and sanitary sewer services. The PUD shall extend the distribution lines along the property to accommodate future service to adjacent properties, unless otherwise approved by the City Commission. Connection to existing water and sewer systems shall be at the developer's expense, except that where the City requires utility lines of greater capacity than required for the proposed development, the City shall be responsible for providing the greater capacity and shall reimburse the developer for such excess costs paid by the developer. No interim water or sewer service outside of the city system shall be allowed. Connection to reclaimed effluent shall be required where available. 
(m)  Drainage and stormwater management. Drainage and stormwater management shall be master planned for the PUD and shall incorporate innovative designs, such as, but not limited to, cisterns, green roofs, rain gardens, pervious pavement, and bio-swales to limit pollution runoff, to off-set potable water use for irrigation, and to aid in efficiently and economically heating and cooling buildings. Drainage and stormwater may be phased, consistent with phasing for the development, provided that the each phase can stand on its own and does not compromise future phases of development. 
(n)  Landscaping. All planted material shall be certified as Florida number one grades and standards (most recent iteration) before installation and shall be installed pursuant to plan specifications or as approved by the City Arborist. These installation specifications shall be consistent with the Institute for Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) standards and best practices. Such plant materials shall have been grown within an approximate 150-mile radius of Seminole County as documented to ensure survivability and sustainability. After installation, the applicant's landscape architect shall certify that the landscape materials have been appropriately installed pursuant to the specifications set forth on the landscape plans approved by the City (e.g. species, quality, height, location, spacing, quantity, site preparation, planting, and mulching). This shall include, but not be limited to, ensuring that plantings are at the prescribed and appropriate depth, in relation to adjacent grade, to ensure survivability.

In addition to complying with any other applicable provision of the City Code including, but not limited to, conditional use and special exception requirements, and applicable provisions of the city's comprehensive plan, compatibility shall be determined by satisfying all of the following factors: 
(1)  The location of the school must serve as a focal point for the community and shall not have an adverse impact on neighborhood quality and harmony. 
(2)  A comprehensive assessment of critical transportation issues, including provision of adequate roadway capacity, transit capacity and bikeways shall be performed for a proposed school prior to any development to ensure safe and efficient transport of students to and from any school. 
(3)  New school sites must minimize potential detrimental impacts on adjacent uses by providing sufficient on-site parking, sufficient internal vehicular circulation to ensure that unsafe stacking of vehicles on access roads does not occur, containment of off-site light spillage and glare, and reduction of off-site noise through compliance with the city's buffer requirements. 
(4)  Demonstrate whether the size and shape of the site, the proposed access and internal circulation, recreational amenities, and the design enhancements proposed will be adequate to accommodate the scale and intensity of the proposed development. The site shall be of sufficient size to accommodate design amenities such as screening, buffers, landscaping, open space, off-street parking, drop off and pick-up zones, and other similar site plan improvements needed to mitigate against potential adverse impacts of the proposed use. 
(5)  Demonstrate whether the proposed school use is compatible and harmonious with adjacent land uses by avoiding location next to incompatible existing land uses such as bars and alcoholic establishments, industrial and high intensity commercial uses, adult oriented businesses, and potentially noxious uses that could materially be harmful to children or interfere with an educational environment. 
(6)  Demonstrate whether or not the new school site will adversely impact land use activities in the immediate vicinity by providing appropriate and sufficient buffering, on-site parking, internal vehicular circulation to ensure safe stacking of vehicles with no interference to adjacent road access and traffic patterns. 
(7)  Demonstrate whether construction of off-site improvements are necessary or not, including but not limited to: signalization, installation of deceleration lanes, roadway striping for crosswalks, safe directional/warning signage and installation of sidewalks. 
(8)  Demonstrate that facilities such as sanitary sewer and potable water will be available at the time demanded by the new school site, and that services such as public safety can be provided. 
(9)  Demonstrate whether or not the proposed use will have an adverse impact on public services, including water, sewer, surface water management, police, fire, parks and recreation, streets, public transportation, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. 
(10)  New school sites shall have safe means of ingress and egress for pedestrians, bicycles, cars, buses, service vehicles and emergency vehicles. High schools and other major school facilities shall be located with access to collector or arterial roads, rather than relying solely on local roads. 
(11)  Ensure compliance with the United States Department of Transportation's Safe Route to Schools initiative. 
(12)  Demonstrate that safe road, bicycle, and sidewalk connections to and from proposed school sites will be provided. 
(13)  Demonstrate that the proposed use will not have an adverse impact on the local economy, including governmental fiscal impact, employment, and property values. 
(14)  Demonstrate that negative fiscal impacts on the city for city services which are not covered by general ad valorem taxes, assessments, permit fees, and service charges are mitigated against by the school.

(b)  Findings and intent. The city has with increasing frequency received requests to approve sites for telecommunications towers. Land development regulations have not adequately identified specific procedures to address recurring issues relating to the approval of locations for telecommunications towers. Therefore, it is the intent of this section to address the recurrent issues pertaining to the approval of telecommunications towers upon parcels located in the city. Accordingly, the city commission finds that the promulgation of this section is warranted and necessary: 
(1)  To protect residential areas and land uses from the potential adverse impacts of telecommunications towers when placed at inappropriate locations or permitted without adequate controls and regulation consistent with the provisions of law; 
(2)  To minimize the adverse visual impacts resulting from telecommunications towers through sound and practical design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques all in accordance with generally acceptable engineering and planning principles and the public health, safety and welfare; 
(3)  To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties through sound engineering and planning and the prudent and careful approval of telecommunications tower sites and structures; 
(4)  To require shared use/co-location of existing and new telecommunications towers (capability of having space for three (3) or more carriers) to avoid proliferation of towers throughout the city. One (1) co-located position shall be reserved exclusively for the use of the city; 
(5)  To ensure that location of telecommunications towers is consistent with the provisions of the City of Winter Springs Comprehensive Plan, the East Central Florida Regional Policy Plan, the state comprehensive plan as well as the provisions of state and federal law; 
(6)  To fix a fair and reasonable compensation, by resolution of the city commission, to be paid to the city for the privilege to locate a telecommunications tower in the city and defray the administrative costs of reviewing the applications. Also, a fee shall apply separately to each antenna user on the tower or other support structure. Fee rates shall be renegotiable when contract expires; 
(7)  To discourage new telecommunication towers and to encourage the use of existing structures including, but not limited to, rooftops, sports lighting, utility poles, and church steeples for deploying personal wireless service facilities; and 
(8)  To encourage the use of the lowest height technology to provide personal wireless services including, but not limited to, micro cell technology. 
(c)  Applicability.

(15)  Prohibitions with certain principal uses. Telecommunications towers are prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, explosive, or hazardous wastes such as LP gas, propane, gasoline, natural gas, and corrosive or dangerous chemicals. This prohibition does not apply to emergency generators. 
(g)  Co-location of communications antennas. The City of Winter Springs desires to minimize the number and general proliferation of communication towers. This section is intended to insure that telecommunication towers that are permitted within the City of Winter Springs are utilized in a manner that provides for the maximum number of service providers upon each tower within the context of technical feasibility and safety. 
Further, this section is intended to minimize the number of such towers within the city. Specifically, as a minimum, telecommunications towers exceeding one hundred (100) feet in height shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate three (3) communication providers. The city shall have the authority to require, specify and otherwise stipulate that telecommunication towers be engineered and constructed in a manner that provides for three (3) co-locations as part of the conditional use and/or site plan approval processes. As a condition of approval of all telecommunication towers and to the extent that co-location is technically feasible, all owners of existing telecommunication towers shall, upon request of another service provider and for reasonable and agreed upon consideration, permit additional communication service providers upon such existing telecommunication tower. Applicants desiring to construct new telecommunication towers shall submit written documentation that clearly explains the need for and reasons for the proposed construction of a new telecommunication tower rather than locating proposed antenna array/communication equipment upon an existing tower. Such documentation shall include plans of existing and future towers by the applicant/provider in question, correspondence with existing telecommunication tower owners and may include a cost analysis of alternatives. Existing service providers, e.g., existing telecommunication tower owners, that are unwilling, upon request of another service provider, to allow co-location upon such existing tower, shall submit written documentation to the city with reasons and justification as to why such co-location cannot be accomplished. Competition between service providers shall not be considered to be a valid reason for preventing or otherwise obstructing co-location. The city shall determine whether the applicant and/or existing provider are reasonable and correct in their respective assertions. If the city determines that either party is being unreasonable or otherwise uncooperative, the city shall deny the applicant's request for a new tower and/or the city may cause the existing telecommunication tower's approval to be revoked and said existing tower to be removed. Such determination involving existing tower owners shall be made in writing and adopted by a majority vote of the city commission upon holding an advertised public hearing and notification of the owner at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing. Upon adoption of such determination by the city commission, the existing tower owner and the property upon which such tower is located shall be considered to be a violation of the city's Land Development Regulations and shall be subject to any and all remedies and penalties thereof. 
To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of telecommunications towers, co-location of communications antennas by more than one (1) carrier on existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedent over the construction of new single-use telecommunications towers as follows: 
(1)  Proposed communications antennas shall co-locate onto existing telecommunications towers. 
(2)  Type of construction. A telecommunications tower which is reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of an additional communications antenna shall be of a monopole tower type. Stealth-designed monopoles are encouraged. 
(3)  Height. An existing telecommunications tower may be modified or rebuilt to the allowed height including antennas by compliance with this article; 
(4)  Onsite-location. 
a.  A Telecommunications tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of an additional communications antenna may be moved onsite, but shall comply with or maximize setback requirements from residentially zoned property. 
b.  After a telecommunication tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location, only one (1) tower shall remain on the site; 
(h)  Certification of compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) NIER Standards. Prior to receiving final inspection by the Winter Springs Building Department, documented certification shall be submitted to the FCC, with copy to the land development coordinator, certifying that the telecommunications facility complies with all current FCC regulations for non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER). 
(i)  Abandonment. 
(1)  In the event the use of any telecommunications tower has been discontinued for a period of one-hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the building official who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the telecommunications tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. The telecommunications tower owner/operator shall provide all requested information within ten (10) working days of a request being made, and failure to so provide shall be deemed to constitute one hundred eighty days (180) days of non-use of the tower. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional ninety (90) days within which to: 
a.  Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or 
b.  Dismantle and remove the tower. With regard to towers that received conditional use approval, ninety (90) days after dismantling or the expiration of the two-hundred seventy (270) day period as set forth in this section, the conditional use and/or variance for the tower shall automatically expire. 
(2)  The City of Winter Springs, upon abandonment, and at its discretion, may assume ownership of the tower at no cost, or require the owner to dismantle the tower at the owner's expense. If the decision is to dismantle the tower, the property shall be cleared of all appurtenances and returned to its natural state. 
(3)  An appropriate surety instrument to assure dismantling costs shall be provided by the owner prior to a tower construction permit.

(2)  The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section. 
(3)  The property owner shall enter a written agreement with the city, recorded in the public records, that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint use driveway. 
(Ord. No. 675, 12-8-97; Ord. No. 2014-34, § 2, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 20-473. - Building and screening design guidelines. 
(a)  Projects shall include but not be limited to the following materials: stucco, split-faced or decorative concrete block, reinforced concrete with tile, "hardie-plank" siding, termite resistant wood, and brick and terra cotta accent material. Materials should be of high quality and well crafted. Any building facade that is visible from a public street or adjacent property shall contain transparent windows covering from fifteen (15) percent to seventy (70) percent of the wall area. 
(b)  Mechanical equipment and appurtenances, including but not limited to air conditioner units, ventilation equipment, refrigeration systems, heating units, etc., must be screened so that they are not visible from any public right-of-way and adjacent residential zoning districts. The screen shall consist of a solid wall, facade, or suitable landscaping. Such screening material shall extend at least one (1) foot above the object to be screened. Said landscaping must be maintained in a fashion so as to continue to provide the intended screening. If landscaping is utilized, the plantings must be an evergreen plant material that is high enough within one (1) year of planting to provide a screen which will screen the entire unit. If roof-top mechanical equipment is utilized, said equipment shall be screened with a parapet that extends at least one (1) foot above the equipment that is screened. A cornice shall delineate the top of the parapet. 
(c)  All storage areas and dumpsters shall be screened from view from the right-of-way and from adjacent residential zoning districts and be located in an enclosure that is consistent with the architectural design of the principal structure. Landscaping measuring at least 36-inches in height at the time of planting must be provided around all dumpster enclosures. 
(d)  Side and rear elevations of buildings visible from a public street or adjacent property shall be designed in the same architectural style as the main facade, with the exception of transparent window requirements. 
(e)  All doors for service entrances or bays shall not face a public street unless they are screened to obscure service activities. 
(f)  Outparcels shall conform to the architectural, signage, and landscape theme of the overall project. 
(g)  Vending machines, and ATM's shall be located within the building. Trash receptacles shall be encased in a decorative enclosure that is architecturally compatible with the building. 
(h)  Exterior lighting shall be a cut-off light source to protect adjacent properties from glare. All exterior lighting shall be consistent and compatible throughout the project. 
(i)  Buildings with multiple storefront entries shall incorporate continuous overhangs or arcades in the design to promote pedestrian activity and to shield pedestrians from excessive sun, heat, and rain. This element will be a component of the aesthetic review of the building pursuant to Chapter 9, Article XII of this Code. 
(j)  Backflow preventers and other above ground valves shall be screened so they are not visible from the street right-of-way using either landscaping or an opaque building material. 
(k)  Drive-thru pick up windows shall not be visible from surrounding residential properties and rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 675, 12-8-97; Ord. No. 2002-13, § 2, 5-13-02; Ord. No. 2014-34, § 2, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 20-474. - Development agreement. 
    Any developer may propose to enter into a development agreement with the city designed to set forth terms and conditions appropriate to meet the circumstances of the specific proposed development. Such development agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the city commission. The city commission may vary the standards of this division, including building or perimeter setbacks, parking standards, signage, and other standards. If an increase in building height beyond five (5) stories is requested, the city staff must document that fire department capabilities are adequate to address the change. Consideration of a height over five (5) stories shall be based on building site constraints or physical characteristics and be memorialized in a development agreement if enhanced perimeter landscaping or buffering is provided to assure that the objectives of this article are achieved.
