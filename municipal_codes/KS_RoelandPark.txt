PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Code of the City of Roeland Park, Kansas, published in book form authorized by Roeland Park City Council by Ord. No. 871, adopted on February 20, 2012. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two figures separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the article number of the chapter and position of the section within the article. Thus, the first section of chapter I, Article 1 is numbered 1-101 and the sixth section of chapter I, Article 2 is 1-206. New sections can be inserted in their proper places in the future by using a decimal system for amendments. If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-307 and 6-308 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-307.1, 6-307.2 and 6-307.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters VII and VIII it will be designated as chapter VII.V. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this volume up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

At a Council meeting in February of each year, nominations shall be made and an election shall be held no later than the last Council meeting in February.

Upon election by a majority of the Councilmembers present, the President of the Council shall be elected for the next term. The Mayor does not have a tie breaking vote in the selection of the President of the Council. If a majority vote of Councilmembers present cannot be met, the following procedure shall be followed. If there are more than two nominations, the number of nominations shall be narrowed down to two and the process repeated. The top two vote getters shall move on. If there is a tie between the second or more vote getters, a coin flip shall decide who is in the top two. If there is a tie in the vote of the final two, a coin shall be flipped to determine the President of the Council. This process will be repeated annually each February.

(3)  Participate in meetings or events on behalf of the Mayor when the Mayor cannot attend due to a schedule conflict; and

Sec. 1-318. - Code of Ethics. 
(a)  Code of ethics for elective and appointive offices; declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for certain City officials is hereby established. The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the City and directing disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the City. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Interest means direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit accruing to a public officer as a result of a contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of any official act or action by or with the City, except for such contracts or transactions which by their terms and by the substance of their provisions confer the opportunity and right to realize the accrual of similar benefits to all other persons and/or property similarly situated. 
For the purposes of this code, a public officer shall be deemed to have an interest in the affairs of: 
A.  Any person related to him/her by blood or marriage in a degree closer than the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity (determined by the civil law method), and a divorce or separation between spouses shall not be deemed to terminate any such relationship;

Unless approved by the Governing Body, use of any such computer for fund raising activities shall be considered to be personal use. 
(d)  Exceptions to code of ethics. 
(1)  It shall not be deemed a violation of the standards of the code if the interest of a public officer in a person or business entity is a contractual obligation of less than $500.00 which has not been preceded by any other obligation, discharged or existing, between the parties, and which is not the first in a series of two or more loans or debts which either of the parties is under an obligation to make or incur.

If any such questions are not resolved through such channels, he or she may apply in writing to the Governing Body for a formal advisory opinion from the Ethics Attorney.

Any public officer so found guilty of violating any provision contained in such sections shall be punished in accordance with the penalties set forth in section 1-117 of the City Code. Public officers in violation of the provisions of this Code shall also be subject to submission to the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission, the Attorney General of Kansas, or the Johnson County, Kansas, District Attorney for review, investigation, and appropriate action pursuant to state law. 
(3)  In addition, where the violation by the public officer has resulted in financial harm to the City or financial profit or gain to the public officer, the City is authorized to seek damages in an amount not to exceed twice the financial harm suffered by the City or twice the profit or gain realized by the public officer, whichever is greater. 
(4)  Violations of any provision of this Code may further constitute cause to cancel any contract, cease negotiations on any contract, and/or rescind or modify any previous action based upon any such violation. 
(i)  Distribution of code of ethics. The City Clerk shall cause a copy of the Code of Ethics to be distributed to every public officer of the City within 30 days after enactment and amendment of the same.

(Ord. No. 687, § 1)

(Ord. No. 687, § 4) 
ARTICLE 11. - PAYDAY AND TITLE LOAN BUSINESSES 

Sec. 5-1101. - Legislative Findings. 
    These businesses should be regulated by the City because certain payday and title loan lending practices have proven detrimental to the financial security of individuals and families residing in the City. Payday and title loan lending practices often have an unreasonably adverse effect upon the elderly, the economically disadvantaged and other residents of the City. Frequently, taking a payday or title loan puts borrowers in much worse financial shape than before they took the loan. Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to require licensing for the purpose of regulating certain payday and title loan lending practices to minimize the detrimental effects of such practices on the citizens of the City by regulating payday and title loan lending practices occurring in the City, consistent with the laws of the State of Kansas. Furthermore, the City finds there is a need to regulate the placement and location of Payday and Title Loan businesses throughout the City. A clustering of these businesses can have a detrimental effect on the neighborhood and create the appearance of a commercial district in decline. These businesses do not create much foot traffic for adjacent businesses and a proliferation of them at particular locations can overwhelm a neighborhood and can be a disincentive for the location of other neighborhood businesses in close proximity to them. Finally, the fact that many surrounding communities in the metropolitan area are adopting or considering adopting restrictions on the location of such businesses could result in the City having an undue concentration of these businesses in the City unless location regulations are enacted. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 2) 
Sec. 5-1102. - Definitions. 
    The term "payday loan business" shall refer to any business regulated by K.S.A. 16a-2-404, as the same may be amended from time to time. The term "title loan business" shall refer, except as provided below, to a consumer loan transaction, including a loan made pursuant to K.S.A. 16-706 et seq., and amendments thereto, secured by a vehicle. It shall not include a purchase money consumer loan or a loan made pursuant to subsection (2) of K.S.A. 16a-2-401 and amendments thereto. The term "vehicle," for the purposes of this section, means every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway and the ownership of which is evidenced by a certificate of title. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 3) 
Sec. 5-1103. - Permit Required. 
    Within 60 days of the effective date of this ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any person or business: 
(a)  To operate or maintain a payday or title loan business in the City unless the owner, operator or lessee thereof has applied for and obtained a payday loan and title loan business permit from the city; or 
(b)  To operate such business after such permit has expired or has been revoked or suspended by the city. 
    Permits shall be required for each location a lender operates in the City, shall be valid for a one-year period of time and may be renewed annually. The application shall be in a form to be determined by the City Clerk. The annual cost for the permit shall be in an amount established by resolution adopted by the Governing Body. This permit shall be in addition to any other permit or license required by other local, state or federal government agencies. No permit shall be issued for any business seeking to operate at a location prohibited by any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation; provided, however, that a business lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of such prohibition may be issued a permit if allowed by such provisions. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 4; Code 2012) 
Sec. 5-1104. - Separation Requirements. 
    No permit shall be issued for any payday or title loan business that is located within 5,280 feet of any other payday or title loan business or within 200 feet of any property used primarily for a single-family residence, a two-family residence, a town home, or an apartment building. The separation distances shall be measured from or to the outer wall of the payday or title loan business, and from or to the property line of the property containing the residential use. However, this separation provision shall not apply to any payday or title loan business that can demonstrate to the City that it was in operation at the location requested in the permit application prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and that it has operated continuously under the same business name since that time. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 5) 
Sec. 5-1105. - Posting Required. 
    Any business that applies for and receives a payday or title loan business permit from the City shall keep such permit posted on a wall within their business in a prominent location clearly visible to potential customers. Failure to keep the permit posted in the manner required shall be prima facie evidence that the business has not obtained such a permit. It shall also be prima facie evidence that any person who performs any business or service as part of the payday or title loan business had knowledge that such business was not permitted. In addition, any business that applies for and receives a payday or title loan business permit from the City shall post a sign in the business at a location clearly visible to potential customers that informs customers of their rights under federal, state or local laws, in a form approved by the City Attorney. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 6) 
Sec. 5-1106. - Unlawful to Work Without Permit.

(Ord. No. 829, § 7) 
Sec. 5-1107. - Periodic Inspection. 
    Any business that applies for and receives a payday or title loan business permit from the City shall be deemed to have consented to periodic entry into and inspection of the business premises by appropriate City officials, including the inspection of only those business records necessary for the limited purpose of determining whether such business enterprise is in compliance with this ordinance or any other applicable state or federal law or regulation. This entry and inspection shall take place during hours when such business is open to the public, unless otherwise requested by the business, and shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such business. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 8) 
Sec. 5-1108. - Suspension or Revocation. 
    Any permit issued pursuant to this article shall be subject to suspension or revocation for the violation of any provision of this ordinance or any applicable local, state or federal law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation. Prior to suspension or revocation of any permit, the City Clerk shall schedule a hearing for the proposed suspension or revocation on the agenda of any regular or special meeting of the City Council and shall mail notice of such hearing to the permittee at least ten) days prior to the date of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall show cause to the City Council why the permit should not be suspended or revoked. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 9) 
Sec. 5-1109. - Penalty. 
    Any violation of any provision of this article by a person or business shall be a public offense and shall be subject to the penalties, fines and civil remedies as set forth in section 1-117 of the Code.

(b)  Within ten days of a request by the City, the service provider will provide to the City information concerning such facilities as may be reasonably requested, including but not limited to number, size and/or locations of existing facilities. 
(c)  When available to the service provider, such information will be submitted electronically in an AutoCad format to the extent compatible with the City's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Johnson County Automated Integrated Mapping Systems (AIMS) provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to require the service provider to acquire or modify any electronic mapping system. Service providers shall maintain a legend on a pay that shows any equipment on more than one foot in any direction. 
(d)  Underground facilities shall be differentiated from overhead facilities and surface mounted facilities. 
(e)  Such mapping and identification shall be at the sole expense of the service provider. 
Sec. 13-808. - Service Provider's Right to Sell, Transfer, Lease, Assign, Sublet or Dispose. 
    Except as provided hereafter, the service provider shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of its facilities, or any portion thereof, that is located in City right-of-way, or any right, title or interest in the same, or the transfer of any rights granted by the City to any person either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, without notice to the City. This provision shall not apply to the sale of property or equipment in the normal course of business or to the sale or lease of facilities to reseller service providers. No notice to the City shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other similar instrument, in whole or in part to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership, or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the service provider. 
Sec. 13-809. - Use of the Right-of-Way. 
(a)  The ROW-user's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City's use or occupation of the right-of-way. The City may reserve sufficient space within the right-of-way for future public improvements. Without limitation of its rights, the City expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the City. 
(b)  The ROW-user shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably determined by the City. Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement as defined in American Public Works Association (APWA) standards. 
(c)  The ROW-user shall consider any request made by the City concerning placement of facilities in private easements in order to limit or eliminate future street improvement relocation expenses or to address aesthetic concerns. 
(d)  All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or interfere with any pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems, or other structures or public improvements already installed. In addition, the ROW-user shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the right-of-way or other public lands of the City. 
(e)  All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of right-of-way and public lands. The City, through its Public Works Director, shall have the right to consult and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being installed. The designer is responsible for complying with the stipulations noted in this ordinance. 
(f)  Whenever reasonably possible, all newly constructed facilities shall be located underground and concealed. The ROW-user shall comply with all requirements of the City relating to underground facilities. This requirement may be waived by the Public Works Director at his/her discretion for safety concerns, or some other good cause under the condition that does not cause discrimination among ROW-users. If this requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the Public Works Director, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location and height. 
(g)  The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other ROW-users without their permission. If and when the City requires or negotiates to have a service provider cease using its existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time, subject to the appeal process contained in section 13-827, as amended. 
(h)  The Public Works Director may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is currently or, pursuant to current technology, the Public Works Director expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All right-of-way permits issued by Public Works Director shall indicate the proper corridor for the ROW-user's facilities. Any ROW-user whose facilities are currently in the right-of-way in a position at a variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by Public Works Director for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, user service needs and hardship to the ROW-user. 
(i)  If, in the preparation and planning of a right-of-way project, the Public Works Director deems it appropriate for a conduit to be constructed along, across or under the right-of-way, the Public Works Director shall contact all appropriate ROW-users for their input on the planning and design of such conduit. If a ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such right-of-way, the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to use such conduit, and to contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided, however, the ROW-user use of the conduit is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. 
(j)  All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the ROW-user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the ROW-user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City. Upon determination by the Public Works Director that such repair or replacement is a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced within twenty-four (24) hours of notice from the City, or the Public Works Director may direct the City to make such repair or replacement and bill the ROW-user for the City cost. The Public Works Director has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the ROW-user to do any necessary additional work. 
(k)  All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of a ROW-user's facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance with applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, including those promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the ROW-user. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this ordinance may be in addition to or stricter than such minimum standards. A ROW-user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the City right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the Public Works Director and having received a permit for such improvement. The Public Works Director may require that any drawings, plans and/or specifications submitted be certified by a Kansas registered professional engineer stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization applying for the permit. 
(l)  The ROW-user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the City or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROW-user without any expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(m)  The City shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the right-of-way by a ROW-user due to public health, safety or welfare considerations. 
(n)  At no location shall any flush or ground surface-mounted fixtures be located more than five feet from a property line that abuts other private property unless agreed upon by the City. 
(o)  Unless otherwise approved by City Council, the following shall govern: No flush or above ground boxes or similar elements larger, wider, taller, or more numerous than existing service provider installation unless agreed upon by the City through an alternative arrangement; provided, however, no above ground box or similar element shall be larger than ten inches wide by ten inches deep by 28 inches high in the Right of Way. Further, that above ground boxes no larger than 34 inches wide by 34 inches high by 16 inches deep may be allowed in public utility easements located at the side or rear property lines of any lot so long as the box is located no closer to the street than within five feet of a building setback line (either platted or required by the zoning regulations); and provided further, that in approving a right-of-way permit, the City Clerk shall require that the box be located in a public utility easement located in the rear yard whenever possible or, when not possible and with the approval of the City, on public property that is within five feet from a property line that abuts private property.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 906, §§ 4, 15, adopted Mar. 2, 2015, repealed the former § 13-809, and enacted a new § 13-809 as set out herein. The former § 13-809 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the original codification. 
Sec. 13-810. - Facility Relocation. 
(a)  The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in the right-of-way as directed by the City for a public improvement or when reasonably required by the City by reason of public health, safety and welfare. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the ROW-user at the ROW-user's expense without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations and schedules of the City pertaining to such. The ROW-user shall proceed with relocations at due diligence upon notice by the City to begin relocation. 
(b)  The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in a private easement, as directed by the City, for a public improvement, at City expense, by moving such facilities to areas within the expanded right-of-way or within remaining private easements or remaining portions of such easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the City to avoid conflict with City construction and improvements. The ROW-user shall disclaim those parts of its easements which lie within the expanded right-of-way. Should the City, in the future, elect to require the ROW-user to again relocate its facilities to other areas within the expanded right-of-way, the cost of any such future relocation shall be borne by the City. 
(c)  As soon as working drawings are available for public improvements which will require the ROW-user to relocate its facilities, the City shall provide the ROW-user with written notice of relocations and the anticipated bid letting date of said improvement. The ROW-user shall respond with any conflicts and a proposed construction schedule within 30 days. 
(d)  Following notice by the City in the form of the delivery of final design plans for such public improvements, the ROW-user shall remove, and relocate its facilities in accordance with the mutually agreed upon schedule, provided the project is not delayed by adverse weather conditions and other factors beyond the control of the ROW-user. The ROW-user shall certify to the City, in writing, that its facilities have been relocated or adjusted to clear construction in accordance with project plans provided by the City. 
(e)  Any damages suffered by the City, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by ROW-user's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the ROW-user. 
(f)  In the event the ROW-user is required to move its facilities in accordance with this section, any ordinary right-of-way permit fee shall be waived. 
(g)  It is the intent of this section for both the City and the ROW-user to cooperate with one another so that the need for facility relocation is minimized and, when required and feasible, relocations may be completed prior to receipt of bids by the City for a public improvement. 
Sec. 13-811. - Protection of the Public. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the ROW-user to take adequate measures to protect and defend its facilities in the right-of-way from harm and damage, and shall maintain its facilities in good condition. 
(b)  The City shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any of the ROW-user's facilities within the right-of-way as a result of or in connection with any construction, excavation, grading, filling or work of any kind, including public improvements by or on the behalf of the City, except to the extent allowed under Kansas law. 
(c)  The ROW-user shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages suffered by them including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the ROW-user to timely perform any of its obligations under this ordinance to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the ROW-user. 
(d)  The City or its authorized contractors shall be responsible for taking reasonable precautionary measures including calling for facility locations when constructing its public improvements. 
(e)  Any ROW-user who for any purpose makes or causes to be made any excavation in, upon, under, through or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley or other right-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building or other material during construction and/or the night time, shall cause the same to be enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption. 
(f)  Whenever a ROW-user shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk, alley, driveway approach or other right-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the excavation until it is refilled as specified. 
(g)  Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely covered. The ROW-user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. 
(h)  The Public Works Director, upon the review and approval of a plan and details for trimming trees in the right-of-way, may grant permission by permit to any ROW-user to trim trees upon and overhanging the right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the facilities of the ROW-user. 
(i)  In the event the ROW-user severely disturbs or damages the root structure of any tree in the right-of-way to the detriment of the health and safety of the tree, the ROW-user will be required to remove and replace the tree at the ROW-user's cost. Further, in review of the ROW-user's plan, the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to directionally bore around any tree in the right-of-way. 
(j)  Upon the appropriate request of any person having satisfied City procedure and ordinances, the ROW-user shall remove, raise, or lower its facilities temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the ROW-user may require such payment in advance. The ROW-user must be given not less than 15 days' written notice from the person detailing the time and location of the moving operations, and not less than 24 hours' advance notice from the person advising of the actual operation.

Sec. 13-812. - Right-of-Way Vacation. 
(a)  If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the service provider's facilities, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all service providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same. 
(b)  If the vacation requires the relocation of facilities; and 
(1)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the service provider, the service provider must pay the relocation costs.

(3)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person other than the service provider or the City, such other person must pay the relocation costs. 
Sec. 13-813. - Abandoned and Unusable Facilities. 
(a)  A ROW-user owning abandoned facilities in the right-of-way must either: 
(1)  Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The Public Works Director may allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the Public Works Director determines that it is in the best interest of public safety to do so. At such time, the City may take ownership and responsibility of such vacated facilities left in place; 
(2)  Provide information satisfactory to the City that the ROW-user's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another authorized ROW-user; or 
(3)  Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the City. If the ROW-user proceeds under this section, the City may, at its option, purchase the equipment, require the ROW-user, at its own expense, to remove it, or require the ROW-user to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities. 
(b)  Facilities of a ROW-user who fails to comply with this section, and whose facilities remain unused for two (2) years, shall be deemed to be abandoned after the City has made a good faith effort to contact the ROW-user, unless the City receives confirmation that the ROW-user intends to use the facilities. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW-user.

Sec. 13-814. - Permit Requirement. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, no ROW-user may excavate any right-of-way or conduct any repair, construction, or reconstruction of facilities located within the right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. Failure to obtain the appropriate right-of-way permit shall result in the assessment of a penalty equal to the amount of the permit fee. 
(b)  There are two exemptions to this provision: 
(1)  Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public improvements; and 
(2)  ROW-users performing routine service operations which do not require excavation in the right-of-way and do not disrupt traffic for more than four hours. 
(c)  No person owning or occupying any land abutting on a public right-of-way shall construct, maintain, or permit in or on the portion of the public right-of-way to which such land is adjacent, any fixed structure, material or object without having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. 
(d)  A right-of-way permit is required for emergency situations. If due to an emergency it is necessary for the ROW-user to immediately perform work in the right-of-way, and it is impractical for the ROW-user to first get the appropriate permit, the work may be performed, and the required permit shall be obtained as soon as possible during the next City working day. 
(e)  No permittee may excavate the right-of-way beyond the date or dates specified in the right-of-way permit unless the permittee: 
(1)  Makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the initial permit; and 
(2)  A new right-of-way permit or permit extension is granted. 
(f)  Right-of-way permits issued shall be conspicuously displayed by the permittee at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the Public Works Director, other City employees and the public. 
(g)  Prior to the commencement of excavation, the permittee shall identify and locate any buried facilities to be spray painted according to the Uniform Color Code required by the Kansas One Call.

(3)  A traffic control plan; and 
(4)  Payment of all money due to the City for permit fees and costs, for prior excavation costs, for any loss, damage or expense suffered by the City because of the applicant's prior excavations of the right-of-way or for any emergency actions taken by the City, unless the payment of such money is in dispute and timely appealed as provided hereafter. 
Sec. 13-816. - Liability Insurance, Performance and Maintenance Bond Requirement. 
(a)  The permittee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the State of Kansas. Should grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance: 
(1)  Workers compensation as provided for under any workers compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers' liability limit equal to the amount required by law.

(c)  The permittee shall at all times during the term of the permit and for two years thereafter, maintain a performance and maintenance bond in a form approved by the City Attorney. The amount of the bond will be $5,000.00 or the value of the restoration, whichever is greater, for a term consistent with the term of the permit plus two additional years, conditioned upon the permittee's faithful performance of the provisions, terms and conditions conferred by this article. An annual bond in an amount of $50,000.00 automatically renewed yearly during this period shall satisfy the requirement of this section. In the event the City shall exercise its right to revoke the permit as granted herein, then the City shall be entitled to recover under the terms of said bond the full amount of any loss occasioned. 
(d)  A copy of the liability insurance certificate and performance and maintenance bond must be on file with the City Clerk. 
(e)  No performance and maintenance bond or liability insurance will be required of any governmental entity, or of any residential property owner working in the right-of-way adjacent to his/her residence, who does not utilize a contractor to perform the excavation.

(a)  If the City Clerk determines that the applicant has satisfied the requirements of this ordinance, the Public Works Director shall issue a right-of-way permit. 
(b)  The City Clerk may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a right-of-way permit and the performance of the permittee in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the right-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. 
(c)  When a right-of-way permit is requested for purposes of installing additional facilities and the performance and maintenance bond for additional facilities is reasonably determined to be insufficient, the posting of an additional or larger performance and maintenance bond for the additional facilities may be required. 
(d)  Issued permits are not transferable. 
(e)  If work is being done for the ROW-user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the person doing the work and the ROW-user shall be liable and responsible for all damages, obligations, and warranties herein described.

In the event the excavation is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the permittee may be liable for actual damages to the City for delay caused by the permittee pursuant to this ordinance. 
(k)  All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed and maintained by the permittee shall be laid, constructed and maintained in accordance with acceptable engineering practice and in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Kansas, as well as the rules and regulations of the Kansas Corporation Commission or any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. 
(l)  Following completion of permitted work for new construction, the permittee shall keep, maintain and provide to the City accurate records and as-built drawings, drawn to scale and certified to the City as accurately depicting the location of all utility facilities constructed pursuant to the permit. When available to the permittee, maps and drawings provided will be submitted in AUTOCAD.DNT or AUTOCAD.DWG automated formats, if available, or in hard copy otherwise.

Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be provided to the permittee and a reasonable time not to exceed 15 days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected. 
(c)  After any excavation, the permittee shall, at its expense, restore all portions of the right-of-way to the same condition or better condition than it was prior, to the excavation thereof. 
(d)  In addition to repairing its own street cuts, the permittee must restore any area within five feet of the new street cut that has previously been excavated, including the paving and its aggregate foundations. 
(e)  If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the Public Works Director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration, the City may, at its option, serve written notice upon the permittee and its surety that, unless within five days after serving of such notice, a satisfactory arrangement can be made for the proper restoration of the right-of-way, the City shall immediately serve notice of failure to comply upon the surety and the permittee, and the surety shall have the right to take over and complete the work, provided, however, that if the surety does not commence performance thereof within ten days from the date of notice, the City may take over the work and prosecute same to completion, by contract or otherwise, at the expense of the permittee, and the permittee and its surety shall be liable to the City for any and all excess cost assumed by the City by reason of such prosecution and completion. 
(f)  The permittee responsible for the excavation who leaves any debris in the right-of-way shall be responsible for providing safety protection in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and any applicable federal or state requirement. 
(g)  If an excavation cannot be back-filled immediately and left unattended, the permittee shall securely and adequately cover the unfilled excavation.

(h)  In restoring the right-of-way, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 24 months following its completion. During the 24 months, the permittee shall, upon notification from the Public Works Director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using any method as required by the Public Works Director. Said work shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 calendar days, of the receipt of notice from the Public Works Director (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting Force Majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable). In the event the permittee is required to perform new restoration pursuant to the foregoing guarantee, the Public Works Director shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for such new restoration for up to an additional 24 months from the date of the new restoration, if the Public Works Director determines any overt action by the permittee not to comply with the conditions of the right-of-way permit and any restoration requirements. 
(i)  The 24 month guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of the pavement surface as well as failure below the pavement surface. 
(j)  Payment of an excavation fee shall not relieve the permittee of the obligation to complete the necessary right-of-way restoration.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the City, or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense.

Sec. 13-832. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. 
Sec. 13-833. - City's Failure to Enforce.

To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the City. Further, the City hereby reserves to itself the right to intervene in any suit, action or proceeding involving the provisions herein. 
(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the provisions of this article shall not infringe upon the rights of any person pursuant to any applicable state or federal statutes, including, but not limited to the right to occupy the right-of-way.

(7)  Section 5108.12 "Temporary Sediment Basin", add the following paragraph; 
A.  Applicability: 
Temporary silt basins are required for all site discharges from sites with disturbed areas exceeding 10 acres in any subbasin or watershed. The City may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis when installation of this type of basin is not feasible due to construction or site constraints. Phased construction shall generally not be considered a constraint that will relieve this requirement. For residential subdivision development, temporary withholding or phased release of one or more residential lots may be necessary to allow adequate area for sediment basin facilities. When existing lakes, other water bodies or sensitive areas are located immediately downstream from a construction site, the City may require silt basins for discharges from subbasins smaller than 10 acres. Additionally, any earthen stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to act as a sediment basin during the construction period unless waived by the City. 
B.  Design Requirements: 
General: 
1)  Maximum drainage area to a single sediment basin shall be 40 acres unless approved by the City. Basins serving greater than 40 acres shall require hydrograph routing computations.

d)  The principal spillway shall include a trash rack or other device to prevent clogging. 
e)  The principal spillway riser pipe, and outflow pipe shall be a minimum diameter of 15 inches. 
f)  The principal spillway riser pipe shall include a Red Painted line to delineate the storage level when sediment storage has reduced the sediment storage to 75% of the design volume. (Typically 100 cubic yard per acre for a basin designed for 134 cubic yards per acre). The line shall be clearly marked "Cleanout Level." 
7)  Emergency Spillway Design: 
a)  Emergency spillways shall be located in a non-fill location when feasible and shall be lined with a non-erodible material, such as rip-rap or turf reinforcement mat. 
b)  The emergency spillway shall be located a minimum of 1 foot above the principal spillway overflow elevation. 
c)  The emergency spillway shall be designed for the 4% (25 year) storm. A minimum of 1 foot freeboard must be provided from the 4% (25 year) design storm elevation to the top of dam.

Practices that fail to perform in the field shall be replaced with more effective substitutes, regardless of prior City reviews. Innovations that engineers or contractors propose which have a high likelihood of improving performance are encouraged and will be considered by the City. All these innovations require City approval for use. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-504. - Post Construction Stormwater Runoff Management System. 
    These sections of this article (15-504-15-512) establish the post construction stormwater runoff management system of the City, which shall be composed of all natural and manmade watercourses and drainage structures, both public and private, located in the City, as well as management controls and management practices as hereinafter established. These controls and practices shall limit any activity that will adversely affect the hydraulic function of detention facilities, open channels, drainage swales or enclosed stormwater conveyance systems. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-505. - Public and Private Responsibilities. 
(a)  Public responsibilities: 
(1)  Administration: The administration of these regulations shall be the responsibility of the Public Works Director, who shall review and approve stormwater management plans as provided herein. 
(2)  Operation and maintenance of publicly-owned facilities: The City Public Works Department shall be responsible, during and after construction, for the operation and maintenance of all drainage structures and improved courses that are part of the stormwater runoff management system under public ownership and that are not constructed and maintained by or under the jurisdiction of any state or federal agency. 
(b)  Private responsibilities: 
(1)  Each developer of land within the City has the responsibility to provide on the developer's property all approved stormwater runoff management facilities to ensure the adequate drainage and control of stormwater on the developer's property both during and after construction of these facilities. 
(2)  Each developer or owner has the responsibility and duty before and after construction to properly operate and maintain any on-site stormwater runoff control facility that has not been accepted for maintenance by the public. This responsibility is to be transmitted to subsequent owners through appropriate covenants or maintenance agreements as detailed in this article. 
(3)  At the sole discretion of the City, the City may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided those facility meets all the requirements of this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for regular inspection and maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-506. - Procedures for Submittal. 
    No development shall increase the quantity and rate of stormwater emanating from land areas, except in accordance with an approved stormwater management plan, as provided in these regulations. The stormwater management plan shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer in the state. No building permits shall be issued until and unless the stormwater management plan has been approved by the Public Works Director. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-507. - Submission of Preliminary Stormwater Management Plan. 
(a)  The purpose of the preliminary stormwater management plan is to determine whether City stormwater requirements will be met with the proposed stormwater management system. The preliminary stormwater management plan for any proposed development shall be submitted with the development plan. 
(b)  The submission requirements in this article are not intended to be duplicative of other provisions of this chapter or any other provision of the Roeland Park City Code as they correspond to development-related activities. Accordingly, the relevant submission requirements may be included in or with any other development application(s) or submission(s) otherwise required by Chapter XVI of the Roeland Park City Code or any City Code provision. Therefore, to the extent that the proposed development activities require compliance with multiple sections and, consequently, require the submission of application components pursuant to different Code sections, these Code sections should allow for the substitution of similar application materials, regardless of presentation format, and should otherwise be interpreted in a light conducive to facilitating the application process; provided, that all the information required therein is in a form that can reasonably be evaluated by the designated decision maker. The decision concerning the form of the information submitted shall be made in the Public Works Director's sole discretion. In addition, the primary decision maker has authority to waive submission requirements determined not to be necessary to the evaluations that are required by this article. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-508. - Review of Preliminary Stormwater Management Plan. 
(a)  Following receipt of the preliminary stormwater management plan and information to be included with this plan, the general drainage concepts and planning proposals will be reviewed by the Public Works Director. A review meeting then may be scheduled by the Public Works Director with representatives of the developer, including the developer's engineer, to review the overall concepts included in the preliminary stormwater management plan. The preliminary stormwater management plan shall be submitted with the preliminary plat or development plan and shall not: 
(1)  Cause flooding outside of the existing flood plain boundary during a one-percent frequent flood that would not have occurred without the proposed improvements; 
(2)  Cause or increase flooding of existing structures; 
(3)  Contribute to unacceptable channel erosion as predicted using criteria established by the City. Unacceptable erosion will include: erosion outside the one-percent flood plain, erosion encroachment close to existing structures, erosion encroachment into roads and infrastructure, threats to designated stream assets, and rapid progression of the channel erosion upstream; 
(4)  Contribute sedimentation to the channels or detention areas (The developer will be responsible for the removal and disposal of all sedimentation that occurs from failure of an approved erosion plan that has been contributed by the proposed development in the joint-use detention basins downstream of the proposed improvements); and 
(5)  Create or contribute adverse impacts to water quality; 
(b)  The City shall consider the impacts to existing structures and other property downstream of the proposed project. This consideration shall extend to immediate impacts on adjacent properties and to the point where the proposed facility drainage area is 10 percent or less of the basin area. The impacts from the flow rate, the velocity and the quality of the runoff shall be considered. The velocity shall not erode or deposit sediments in designated stream assets. The runoff should not contain excessive sediment concentrations, biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nutrient, organic, total dissolved solid, heavy metal or pathogen levels that threaten the viability and health of the designated stream assets or the joint-use or regional retention system. The threshold of acceptable limits shall be based on the limits set by KDHE in Article 16 Water Pollution Control, Surface Water Quality Standards, KAR 28-16-28e. 
(c)  In addition, the City's review and approval process shall involve the consideration of the applicant's use of alternative design methods to reduce imperviousness, peak flows, and velocities to minimize erosion and sedimentation and to protect the water quality of the stormwater runoff discharged into the stormwater system. 
(d)  Finally, the City shall consider the applicant's incorporation of multiple uses into the stormwater management facility/system. To the extent that recreational use, trails, open space, are utilized, the level of imperviousness may be increased at the discretion of the City. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-509. - Final Stormwater Runoff Management Plan. 
    Following review of the preliminary stormwater management plan and general approval of the preliminary stormwater management plan by the Public Works Director, a final stormwater management plan shall be prepared for each phase of the proposed project, as each phase is developed and prior to the issuance of any building permit. A professional engineer, registered in the state, shall sign and properly seal the plan. The final plan shall constitute a refinement of the concepts approved in the preliminary stormwater management plan and shall include the information required in 15-507. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-510. - Review and Approval of Final Stormwater Management Plan. 
(a)  Final stormwater management plans shall be reviewed by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may, based on review of the submittal, approve the Plan if the proposed development will provide management of stormwater runoff in accordance with the purposes, design criteria and performance standards of these regulations and the City's watershed management program and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. The Public Works Director may approve the stormwater management plan or conditionally approve the stormwater management plan, setting forth the conditions thereof. If it is determined that the proposed development will not properly manage stormwater runoff in accordance with these regulations, the Public Works Director shall reject the final stormwater management plan. If rejected, the application and data shall be returned to the applicant for resubmittal. 
(b)  The Public Works Director shall have the authority to waive the requirement of a stormwater management plan meeting all of the requirements in those individual cases that involve the construction of a single building or an addition to an existing building or otherwise have no significant effect on the drainage characteristics of the watershed. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-511. - Design Criteria. 
(a)  The following documents shall jointly govern the design of improvements with respect to managing stormwater: 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided, Section 5600 Storm Drainage Systems and Facilities of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria of the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter of the American Public Works Association, dated February 15, 2006, is hereby incorporated by reference for the purpose of regulating the design of improvements with respect to stormwater runoff. Not less than one copy of Section 5600 shall be marked "Official Copy as Adopted by Ordinance No. 809," with all sections or portions thereof intended to be omitted or modified clearly marked to show any such omissions or modifications, and to which shall be attached a copy of this incorporating ordinance, and shall be filed with the City Clerk and open to inspection and available to the public at all reasonable business hours. 
(2)  Sections 5601.5 and 5608.4 of the Storm Drainage Systems and Facilities of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria of the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter of the American Public Works Association, dated February 15, 2006, are hereby repealed and new Sections 5601.5 and 5608.4 are added to read as follows: 
(b)  General Guidelines: 
(1)  Natural channels are to be preserved to the maximum extent practicable as site conditions permit. Design standards for natural channels are addressed in Section 5605. Engineered channels, the next highest priority system component, shall be designated and coordinated with the design of building lots and streets in accordance with the design criteria and performance standards addressed in Section 5607. 
(2)  To the maximum extent possible, drainage systems, street layout and grades, lot patterns and placement of curbs, inlets and site drainage and overflow swales shall be concurrently designed in accordance with the design criteria and performance standards set forth in this document. Curb and gutter may be omitted or modified where approved by the City Engineer and deemed feasible in conjunction with other stormwater management practices including water quality BMPs. 
(3)  Enclosed conveyance systems consisting of inlets, conduits and manholes may be used to convey stormwater runoff where site conditions and open space requirements will not permit the use of natural or engineered channels. Where used, these systems must be designed in accordance with design criteria and performance standards addressed in Section 5606. 
(4)  Generally, a public storm drainage system is constructed when the peak discharge is greater than 8 cfs for the 10% design storm and the drainage is generated by more than one lot or the drainage area is greater then 2 acres. 
(c)  Open Systems: Where feasible, open systems consisting of open or engineered channels shall be used if all of the following design criteria and the conditions of Section 5601.8 are met: 
(1)  The channel slope is less than or equal to 5 % or where appropriate armoring techniques are used to prevent erosion; or 
(2)  The 50% design storm velocity is less than or equal to 5 feet per second (fps) or where appropriate armoring techniques are used to prevent erosion; 
(d)  Enclosed Systems: Enclosed systems consisting of underground pipes, culverts and similar underground structures shall be used to convey stormwater at all locations whenever one of the following design criteria and the conditions of 5601.8 are met: 
(1)  Where natural channels or open systems are not feasible per the requirements set forth in Section 5605 and Section 5601.5-A1; or 
(2)  Within the right-of-way of streets with curbs, regardless of system design capacity. 
(e)  Stormwater Management: 
(1)  New development or redevelopment as defined in Section 5601.2 shall incorporate stormwater management measures to control runoff from the site. The allowable runoff is defined by the volume, timing, and peak rate of runoff and is dependent on the watershed characteristics. Allowable runoff may be limited by the need to minimize flood damage, prevent erosion, and/or minimize impacts to the ecology and water quality of the downstream drainage system. 
(2)  Stormwater management for site development may include structural facilities and/or non-structural solutions. The Developer shall evaluate the site development plan according to the flowchart in Figure 5601-1. This chart provides decision criteria for determining the potential impacts of the site on the watershed. Beginning with the hexagon-shaped dialog box in the upper left of the chart, check the requirements as indicated, then proceed to the next dialog box to the right. Determine the "yes" or "no" answer to the question in the dialog box, and continue to next box to the right or below, according to the answer. Where runoff controls are required, low-impact development practices or off-site control of runoff in addition to or instead of the standard wet or dry bottom basins may be used. See Section 4-5-E-15 (B). 
(3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the opinion of the City that any development will degrade water quality, cause stream erosion and contribute to adverse ecological impacts. Therefore, at the discretion of the Public Works Director, controls shall be implemented for the 10% and 100% storms. 
(4)  Flood problems are defined as one or more of the following conditions; 
A.  Homes, buildings, or other structures downstream from a proposed development are flooded in a 1% or more frequent flood; 
B.  Flood damage problem areas for the 1% or more frequent flood have been identified, or an engineering study indicated the proposed development would cause or increase such flooding; 
C.  Street flooding as defined in 5601.5-A-4-b or as defined by the City/County; and 
D.  To identify existing local flooding problems, the stormwater management study for a development project shall include an analysis of the existing downstream drainage system to the point the development's land mass is less than 10% of the total watershed, unless waived by the City. The City may require additional analysis of the downstream drainage system to identify flooding problems, especially in sensitive areas or where flooding has occurred downstream. 
(5)  If flooding problems will occur, as defined above, runoff from the development shall be controlled by limiting the stormwater release rates for the 1%, 10% and 100% design storms to the predevelopment peak flow rates for the 1%, 10% and 100% storms respectively. If flooding problems will not occur, as defines above, detention of the 1% storm will not be allowed. 
(6)  Additionally, the City may require a study to verify downstream predevelopment peak flow rates are not increased at specific downstream locations due to the development. Some communities may also establish more stringent release rates in sensitive watersheds. 
(f)  Overflow Systems: Each conveyance element of the stormwater drainage system (whether open, enclosed, or detention) shall include an overflow element. When the in-system capacity defined in Sections 5601.8 and 5608 is exceeded, the overflow element shall be designed to route the surcharge downstream. Types of overflow systems are site-dependent and may include streets, channels, overland surfaces, redundant piping, or spillways, or combinations thereof. The in-system capacity combined with the overflow system capacity shall be sufficient to convey the peak discharge generated by the 1% design storm without flooding problems. The maximum water surface elevation of the 1% storm stage at any point along the drainage system shall be no greater than: 
(1)  One foot below the lowest elevation at which water may enter any proposed or existing building or structure; AND 
(2)  A depth of 7 inches at the lowest point of the traveled roadway. This may be the curb flowline, the road centerline, or somewhere in between, depending on the site. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-512. - Performance Criteria. 
(a)  Computational methods: 
(1)  Time of concentration and travel time: Refer to Section 5602 for acceptable hydrology methods. 
(2)  Temporary storage volume: A preliminary value of the storage requirement may be obtained through methods outlined in (SCS, 1986, Chapter 6) or other acceptable methods. The storage shall be checked during routing or design hydrographs through the basin and adjusted appropriately. 
(3)  Hyrdrograph routing: The storage indication method (Modified Puls) of routing a hydrograph through a detention basin may be utilized. Reference: (Chow, 1964). 
(b)  Release rate: The maximum release rate from any development for the 1%, 10%, and 100% storms shall be limited according to section 5601.5-A-4 and the decision flowchart in Figure 5601-1, "Guide to Stormwater Management for Site Development." 
(c)  Detention Basin Size: Owners/engineers may utilize methodology outlined in (SCS, 1986). A Type II rainfall distribution shall be the required storm hyetograph. Hydrologic simulation models shall be based on not less than Antecedent Moisture Condition II (see Section 5602.2). Maximum detention storage shall be based upon the allowable release rate and upon the developed condition for the site. Basin volume shall be sized for the largest applicable, 24-hour design storm. The City Engineer may establish additional standards for other storm sizes to provide stream channel and water quality protection. 
(d)  Primary outlet works: The primary outlet shall be designed to meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The outlet shall be designed to function without requiring attendance or operation of any kind or requiring use of equipment or tools, or any mechanical devices. 
(2)  All discharge from the detention facility when inflow is equal or less than the (largest applicable design storm) inflow shall be via the primary outlet. 
(3)  The design discharge rate via the outlet shall continuously increase with increasing head and shall have hydraulic characteristics similar to weirs, orifices or pipes. 
(4)  For dry detention basins, the design shall allow for discharge of at least 80 percent of the detention storage volume within 24 hours after the peak or center of mass of the inflow has entered the detention basin. 
(5)  Ponds shall be designed with a non-clogging outlet such as a reverse-slope pipe, or a weir outlet with a trash rack. A reverse-slope pipe draws from below the permanent pool extending in a reverse angle up to the riser and established water elevation of the permanent pool. Because these outlet draw water from below the level of the permanent pool, they are less likely to be clogged by floating debris. 
(6)  All opening shall be protected by trash racks, grates, stone filters, or other approved devices to ensure that the outlet works will remain functional. 
(7)  If a detention basin is to be used as a water quality BMP, the basins must be sized to detain the entire water quality storm such that the entire water quality storm leaves the basin no sooner than 40 hours after the start of the rainfall event. 
(e)  Emergency spillways: The emergency spillway may either be combined with the outlet works or be a separate structure or channel meeting the following criteria: 
(1)  Elevation: Emergency spillways shall be designed so that their crest elevation is 0.5 feet or more above the maximum water surface elevation in the detention facility attained by the largest applicable design storm. 
(2)  Capacity: In cases where the impoundment/emergency spillway is not regulated by either State or Federal agencies, the emergency spillway shall be designed to pass the 1% storm with one foot of freeboard from the design stage to the top of the dam, assuming zero available storage in the basin and zero flow through the primary outlet. This design provides and added level of protection in the event of a clogged primary outlet or a subsequent 1% storm event that occurs before the flow pool from the initial storm even recedes to the principal outlet elevation. 
(f)  Draw down provision: Drain works consisting of valves, gates, pipes, and other devices as necessary to completely drain the facility in 72 hours or less when required for maintenance or inspection shall be provided. 
(g)  Erosion control: Primary outlet works, emergency spillways, and drain works, as well as conveyance system entrances to detention basins, shall be equipped with energy dissipating devices as necessary to limit shear stresses on receiving channels. See Tables 5605-1 and 5606-2 for shear stress criteria. 
(h)  Detention basins designed to accommodate the 1% storm event shall not be combined with bio-retention. 
(i)  The Manual of Best Management Practices for Stormwater Quality, dated September 2003 and published by the Mid-America Regional Council and the American Public Works Association is hereby incorporated by reference for the purpose of providing guidance for planning and implementing best management practices that will control volumes and quality of stormwater discharges and thereby provide crucial assistance in protecting human life and property, maintaining overall water quality and for creating more environmentally sensitive site design. One copy of this document shall be stamped or marked "Official Copy" and filed with the City Clerk and kept with Section 5600, to be open to inspection and available to the public at all reasonable hours. 
(j)  The selected BMP(s) must be properly integrated into the overall landscape design, providing aesthetic value in addition to the desired function. It is understood that required planting areas may need to be increased to accommodate stormwater management practices. 
(k)  Applicability of these standards: These standards shall apply to all development occurring in the City after the effective date of this section; provided, however, that the standards shall not apply to: 
(1)  Land which is covered by an approved final development plan, site plan or final plat where approval was given on or before September 4, 2007, and where construction of any approved detention facility was begun on or before that date; or 
(2)  Land which is covered by an approved preliminary development plan or preliminary plat, where approval was given on or before September 4, 2007, and where construction of any approved detention facility was not yet begun on that date, shall only be required to comply with these standards by modifying the detention basin to provide 50%, 10% and 1% storm protection and appropriate clean stormwater BMPs, but only to the extent that the modification does not change the lot count or significantly alter the character of any lots shown on the approved preliminary development plan or plat. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any development plan, site plan or plat covering land exempted pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) above is amended to a substantial or material degree, compliance with these standards shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-513. - Performance Bonds and Other Assurances for Completion of Stormwater Management Improvements. 
    Upon approval of the final stormwater management plan, but before the issuance of the engineering permit, the Public Works Director shall require the applicant to post a performance bond, cash escrow, certified check or other acceptable form of performance guaranty for the amount of the work to be done pursuant to the approved stormwater management plan. 
Sec. 15-514. - Maintenance Bond.

(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-516. - Action Upon Noncompliance 
(a)  Enforcement during construction. 
(1)  If it is determined through inspection that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan, the Public Works Director shall issue written notice to the developer and the surety of the nature and location of the alleged noncompliance, specifying what remedial work is necessary to bring the project into compliance, and setting forth the time period allowed to correct the noncompliance. The written notice shall be accompanied by documentary evidence demonstrating noncompliance. The developer so notified shall, unless weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the permittee prevent immediate remedial action, commence the recommended remedial action and shall complete the remedial work within the time allotted by the City. Upon satisfactory completion of the remedial work, the Public Works Director shall issue a notice of compliance and the development may proceed. 
(2)  If the permittee or land owner fails to make the required corrections within the time period allotted by the City, the Public Works Director may post a stop work order at the site directing that all construction activity cease immediately. For the purposes of this section, a stop work order effective upon posting a copy of the stop work order on the site. A person must not continue or permit the continuance of work in an area covered by a stop work order, except work required to correct violations under this article. No inspections shall be performed and no additional permits will be issued by the City for the site while a stop work order is in effect. Any person who shall continue to work after a stop work order has been posted, except such work as that person is directed by the City to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, is guilty of a public offense and may be subject to penalties as prescribed herein. 
(3)  The City must provide written notice to the permittee or a representative of the permittee when a stop work order is issued. A copy of the order, in the case of work for which there is a permit, shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address listed by the permittee on the permit. In the case of work for which there is no permit, a copy of the order shall be mailed to the person listed as owner of the property by Johnson County land records. That notice must specify the extent to which work is stopped and the conditions under which work may resume. The permittee is responsible for the actions of agents of the permittee and must notify those agents when a stop work order is issued that will affect an area within which the agents are to work. In this regard, "agent" is defined as any person who acts at the instruction, with the permission, or to the benefit of the permittee. 
(4)  Failure of the permittee to make the necessary corrections within ten days after a stop work order is posted shall constitute a public offense and is punishable as prescribed in this article. Upon such failure, the City may: 
A.  Issue a notice to appear, setting a date and time for appearance in Municipal Court. The Public Works Director and the Public Works Director, and their designees, shall have authority to issue a notice to appear under this article. The City may seek all criminal and civil penalties allowed by this chapter, as well as any injunctive relief that may be appropriate; and/or 
B.  Correct or abate the violation. 
(5)  If the City performs work to correct a violation of this article, the costs incurred by the City to perform this work shall be paid by the owner or permittee out of the performance guaranty required by section 15-513. If the cost of the work necessary to correct the violation exceeds the amount of the performance guaranty, the permittee shall continue to be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for payment of all excess costs and expenses incurred by the City. The cost of necessary work in excess of the performance guaranty shall be certified by the City Clerk to the Clerk of Johnson County, Kansas, and shall, to the extent authorized by law, become a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay that cost. The cost of necessary work shall be listed on the tax bill and be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes to the extent authorized by law. In the event no performance guaranty was posted, the cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the City, plus a reasonable administrative fee shall be billed to the owner. If in any event the amount due is not paid, the City Clerk shall certify the amount due to the Clerk of Johnson County, Kansas, and it shall, in accordance with law, become a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay the amount due. This amount shall be listed on the tax bill and be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes as authorized by law. 
(6)  The Public Works Director and their designees shall have authority, but not the obligation, to issue additional notices and extend the time given to a permittee to perform any action required under this section. 
(b)  Enforcement of maintenance requirements. 
(1)  When a property owner violates the maintenance requirements of this section, the Public Works Director or his or her designee shall notify the property owner in writing of the nature and location of the violation, describe the required corrective action, and the time period to have the violation corrected. Failure of the property owner to make the necessary corrections within the specified timeframe shall constitute a public offense and is punishable as prescribed in this article. 
(2)  If, after receiving notice of a violation of maintenance requirements, a property owner fails to perform the required corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice of violation, the City may: 
A.  Issue a notice to appear, setting a date and time for appearance in Municipal Court. The Public Works Director and the Public Works Director's designees, shall have authority to issue a notice to appear under this article. The City may seek all criminal and civil penalties allowed by this chapter, as well as any injunctive relief that may be appropriate; and/or 
B.  Correct or abate the violation. 
(3)  If the City performs work to correct a violation of this article, the property owner shall be liable for the costs incurred by the City to perform this work. Within 30 days after performing the work necessary to correct the violation, the City shall issue a written notice containing the nature of the work performed, the date the work was performed, the cost of such work, and a statement that the property owner must pay for the cost of the work within 30 days to avoid having a lien filed against the property. The cost to correct the violation, plus interest at the rate authorized by the City, plus a reasonable administrative fee shall be billed to the property owner. If in any event the amount due is not paid, the City Clerk shall certify the amount due to the Clerk of Johnson County, Kansas, and it shall, in accordance with law, become a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay the amount due. This amount shall be listed on the tax bill and be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes as authorized by law. 
A.  Enforcement against homes associations. 
1.  For purposes of this article, the term "homes association" shall mean an organization representing property owners within a planned development that is responsible for the ownership and maintenance of a stormwater management system. 
2.  If a homes association fails to correct a violation within the time period identified in this section, then the City may choose any of the remedies provided in this section. If the City performs work to correct a violation of this article, the homes association shall be responsible for the costs incurred by the City to perform this work. Within 30 days after performing the work necessary to correct the violation, the City shall issue a written notice containing the nature of the work performed, the date the work was performed, the cost of such work, and a statement that the association must pay for the cost of the work within 30 days to avoid having a lien filed against the property. If the homes association fails to pay for the cost of the work within 30 days after receiving the notice, the City shall hold a public hearing for the purpose of determining how the cost of the work shall be assessed against the properties within the planned development. All property owners represented by the homes association shall be given notice of such hearing. After determining how the cost of work shall be assessed, the City Clerk shall certify the amount due by each property owner within the planned development to the Clerk of Johnson County, Kansas, and it shall, in accordance with law, become a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay the amount due. This amount shall be listed on the tax bill and be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes as authorized by law. 
(c)  Any person who violates a provision of this article, fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof, or fails to comply with a directive of the City as authorized by this article is guilty of a public offense and shall be subject to penalties as provided in section 10-410 of this Code. In addition, the City may seek such additional remedies as are allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-517. - Appeals.

(3)  The Governing Body shall act on the appeal within a reasonable time after receiving the appeal. 
(c)  The decision of the Governing Body shall be considered final. No further appeal will be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 809, § 1) 
Sec. 15-518. - Minimum Standards. 
    The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirements which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. Depending upon the individual circumstances, additional design criteria and performance standards may be necessary. Use of the requirements contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the City or its officers and employees of the adequacy or safety or any stormwater management structure or use of land, nor shall it constitute approval of damages caused by stormwater runoff. The degree of protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or stormwater runoff heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article, therefore, shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
Sec. 15-519. - Violation and Penalties. 
    Unless otherwise provided, penalties for violations of this chapter shall be assessed as provided in section 1-117 of the Roeland Park City Code.

DIVISION IV. - PLANNED DISTRICTS 

Sec. 16-428. - Planned Zoning Districts; Statement of Objectives. 
    The zoning of land to one of the planned zoning districts designated in section 16-402(b) shall be for the purpose of encouraging and requiring orderly development at a quality level generally equal to or exceeding that commonly found in projects developed under conventional zoning, but permitting deviations from the normal and established development techniques. The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage large-scale developments, efficient development of small tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning, conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land. The following are specific objectives of the planned zoning districts: 
(a)  The conventional zoning districts should generally not be applied to the improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development. Consequently, with the exception of residential subdivisions, development proposals which are intended to be subdivided into multiple lots should generally be rezoned to one or more planned zoning districts to ensure the compatibility, coordination, timing and sequencing of development. From and after the adoption of these planned zoning provisions, property shall not be rezoned to either office building district or retail business district except under unique circumstances, and only upon a showing that requiring rezoning to a planned zoning district would result in undue hardship upon the landowner. 
(b)  Planned developments are groupings of buildings or building sites that are planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the zoning was approved by the City. The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt or protect the portions thereof from complying with the development standards, architectural quality, sign concepts and other conditions that were committed to at the time of the rezoning. The submittal by the developer and the approval by the City of development plans represents a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans in concept, intensity of use, aesthetic levels and quantities of open space. 
(c)  Planned commercial and industrial developments should be designed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters, as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to assure minimum adverse affects on the street system and other services of the community. 
(d)  The developer will be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land not feasible under application of conventional zoning requirements. 
(e)  Deviations from the performance and development standards, as provided for in section 16-449, may be approved if it is deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the extent that an equal or higher quality development is produced. 
Sec. 16-429. - Planned Zoning Districts; Standards of Development. 
(a)  The uses permitted in any planned zoning district shall be those set forth in the section applicable to that planned zoning district. Provided, however, were found to be reasonably necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, the City may condition approval of a development plan by specifying that certain uses otherwise permitted in the district shall not be allowed in that particular development. 
(b)  At the time of preliminary development plan approval, the applicant may propose, or the City may require, that a phasing plan be submitted setting forth the timing and sequencing of development among various types of uses or subgroups of uses or buildings in the development. 
(c)  As a general rule, the floor area ratio shall be as set forth in the section applicable to a particular planned zoning district. Provided, however, that as long as the overall density of the development does not exceed the density otherwise permitted for a parcel of that size, taking into consideration standard street patterns and right-of-way requirements, the density of portions of the development may vary from that otherwise applicable to that planned zoning district. In determining whether or not to allow the density of development to be varied, the Planning Commission and Governing Body shall give consideration to the following: (1) the amount, location and proposed use of common space; (2) the location and physical characteristics of the site of the proposed development; and (3) the location, design and type of uses. 
(d)  Any common open space resulting from the variance of standards for density of land shall be set aside for the use and benefit of the occupants of the development. The amount of common open space shall be determined at the time of preliminary development plan approval. As a condition of preliminary plan approval, the Planning Commission or Governing Body may require that the developer provide for and establish an agency for the ownership and maintenance of any common open space and may require assurance of the financial and administrative ability of any agency. Further, the Planning Commission or Governing Body may require that any agency shall not be dissolved or permitted to dispose of any common open space by sale or otherwise (except to a new agency assuming all the duties and obligations of the original agency) without first offering to dedicate the same to the City or any other government agency. Failure of the agency to maintain the common open space shall be considered to be a violation of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
(e)  At the time of final development plan approval the Planning Commission may apply the provisions of Article 14, Subdivision Regulations, to the planned development and upon the acceptance of the Governing Body, the filing of the final development plan with the Register of Deeds shall constitute the effective dedication of easements, rights-of-way, access control and the equivalent of an alternate for the platting of land prior to the issuance of buildings permits for the planned development. Rule exceptions to the standards set forth in Article 4 of this chapter may be granted at the time of the final development plan approval under the same conditions applicable to plat approvals. 
(f)  Standards for the design, bulk and location of buildings and structures shall be as set forth in the sections applicable to any planned zoning district. Provided, that the Planning Commission or Governing Body may, in the process of approving preliminary or final development plans, approve the following deviations from the minimum standards where there is ample evidence that the deviations will not adversely affect neighboring property and that this action will not constitute the mere granting of a privilege: 
(1)  Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a public street right-of-way may be reduced to 75 percent of the stated requirement. 
(2)  Setbacks of buildings from a property line other than a public street right-of-way may be reduced to 85 percent of the stated requirement and setbacks of paved areas from a property line other than a public street right-of-way may be reduced to zero, if existing or proposed development on that adjacent land justifies any reduction. 
(3)  Side yards between buildings may be reduced to zero. 
(4)  Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a freeway right-of-way may be reduced to five feet. 
(5)  A portion of the parking area required under this title may remain unimproved until such time as the City Council deems it must be improved to serve parking demand adequately. 
(6)  Reduction of setbacks or other open space shall be compensated by additional open space in other appropriate portions of the project and shall be in keeping with good land use planning principles. 
(g)  The Planning Commission or Governing Body may, in the process of approving preliminary or final development plans, approve deviations from applicable development standards other than those listed in subsection (f) of this section only if it finds that all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  That the deviation requested arises from a condition which is unique to the property in question, is not ordinarily found in the same zoning district, and is not created by an action or actions of the landowner or the applicant. 
(2)  That the granting of the deviation will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent landowners or residents. 
(3)  That the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would constitute unnecessary hardship upon the landowner represented in the application. 
(4)  That the deviation desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare. 
(5)  That the granting of the deviation will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of this chapter. 
(h)  The design of all planned developments shall be that access and circulation by firefighting equipment and other emergency vehicles is assured and may not be retarded by steep grades, heavy landscaping or building spacing. 
Sec. 16-430. - Planned Industrial Park District; Uses. 
    In a planned industrial park district, District P-I, no building or premises shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected or altered, unless otherwise provided in this article, except for the following:

Sec. 16-450. - "MXD" Planned Mixed-Use District; General Purpose and Description. 
    The zoning of property to MXD, planned mixed use district, is intended to encourage sustainable neighborhoods with a mixture of land uses, independently or when combined with adjacent mixed use zoned areas, which create a distinctive and unique sense of place. This district is expected to have a pedestrian orientation with a mixture of residential, office and retail uses in closer proximity to one another than would be possible with conventional zoning districts. Developments in this district are expected to have a defined character, public spaces and a central gathering space or focal point. Developments are also expected to utilize shared parking facilities linked to multiple buildings and uses by an attractive and logical pedestrian network that places more emphasis on the quality of the pedestrian experience than is generally found in typical suburban development. Buildings are intended to be primarily multistory structures with differing uses organized vertically rather than the horizontal separation of uses that commonly results from conventional zoning districts. 
Sec. 16-451. - Permitted Uses. 
    Mixed use districts are encouraged to include a mix of residential, office and commercial uses, either within an individual property zoned "MXD" or as part of a larger area of similarly zoned properties. The size, location, appearance and method of operation may be specified to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with the purpose of this district. After approval of the MXD District, uses may be added, changed or deleted by amendment. The procedure for considering an amendment shall be the same as for the original adoption. Permitted uses include the following, unless otherwise modified or prohibited by the ordinance granting a MXD planned mixed use district: 
(a)  Any use permitted in District CP-1. 
(b)  Multiple-family dwellings. 
(c)  Live-work spaces. 
(d)  Any other use established by the ordinance granting a MXD planned mixed use district.

Sec. 16-453. - Area and Height Regulations. 
    Area and height regulations for each separate MXD, planned mixed use district, shall be set forth in the ordinance granting the MXD district and may include but shall not be limited to: lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard setbacks, building height, lot coverage, dwelling unit size, density, and other requirements as the City Council may deem appropriate. 
(a)  Building height. 
(1)  No maximum height, provided that the height of buildings shall be as determined by the MXD development plan; 
(2)  At least 50 percent of the total floor area (excluding structured parking) shall be located above the ground floor, with the exception of auditoriums, conference facilities, theaters, and other similar uses. 
(b)  Setbacks. The requirements regulating setbacks shall conform to the following, unless otherwise approved by the City Council as a part of the preliminary development plan. Additionally, during the rezoning or preliminary development plan approval process, the City Council may require additional setbacks, if it is determined that the yard is necessary to provide adequate open space, access to light and air, a healthful living environment, prevent visual obstruction of adjoining properties, or to ensure compatibility with existing adjacent development. 
(1)  Front yard setback. No minimum requirement. The front yard setback shall be established as shown on the approved MXD plans. 
(2)  Side yard setback. No setback required except that where a lot line abuts the lot line of a residentially zoned property, a setback shall be required which is at least equal to the minimum setback required in the district which the MXD District abuts. 
(3)  Rear yard setback. No setback required except that where a lot line abuts the lot line of a residentially zoned property, a setback shall be required which is at least equal to the minimum setback required in the district which the MXD District abuts. 
Sec. 16-454. - Parking and Loading Regulations. 
    Off-street parking and loading requirements for each separate MXD, planned mixed use district, shall be as set forth in sections 16-801 through 16-820 unless otherwise modified by the ordinance granting the MXD district. 
(a)  The City Council may reduce the parking and loading requirements set forth by sections 16-801 through 16-820 after considering documentation and/or study provided by the applicant, staff's recommendation, and giving decisive weight to all relevant facts including, but not limited to the following factors: Availability and accessibility of alternative parking; the availability of bicycle parking; impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods; existing or potential shared parking arrangements; the characteristics of the use, including hours of operation and peak parking demand times; design and maintenance of off-street parking that will be provided; and whether the proposed use is new or a small addition to an existing use. 
(b)  Shared or community parking areas shall be required. Off-street parking areas shall be small in scale and divided into surface parking fields not to exceed 50 parking spaces, unless otherwise approved by the City Council. 
(c)  Maximum grade level parking allowed per use or per project shall be 150 percent of the minimum parking required for that use. Any new parking facility with a capacity 200 spaces shall accommodate no more than 50 percent of the total parking at grade level. 
(d)  On-street parking spaces on public and private streets may be counted towards the required off-street parking, provided the on-street spaces are located on an adjacent or internal street that allows on-street parking.

Bicycle parking must be provided by bicycle racks or lockers that are anchored so that they cannot be easily removed. Unless otherwise approved by City Council, bicycle parking must be located within 50 feet of an entrance to the building. 
Sec. 16-455. - Development and Performance Standards. 
    Unless otherwise approved by the City Council, development within the MXD zoning district shall comply with the standards pursuant to section 16-449, any duly adopted design guidelines applicable for that property, and the following minimum guidelines.

(f)  Roadway design. The roadway designs used within the different areas of a MXD district may vary depending on the proposed function of the roadway, the anticipated adjacent land uses, the anticipated traffic load, and appropriate accommodations for pedestrian and bicycle facilities as directed by the City Engineer. Streets in a MXD district may be narrower than in conventional development, as well as more varied in size and form to control automobile traffic and give character to the district or neighborhood. A variety of unique and innovative roadway designs that lend character to the neighborhood and provide safe pedestrian and bicycle facilities are required. 
(g)  Vehicular access to alleys or lanes. Residential driveway access from a lot to an alley or lane in a MXD is permitted and preferred. Driveway access from a lot to a street is permitted, subject to architectural design and setback requirements detailed with development plan approvals. Where garage access is from the street, special architectural and setbacks are required to ensure the garage is not the dominant building feature. 
(h)  Drive-up and drive-thru services. All drive-up, drive-thru, and drive-in services shall be prohibited, unless specifically exempted in the ordinance granting the MXD district. When permitted, these facilities shall be integrally designed into the development; the drive-thru lane and drive-thru window shall not be located where visible from the public street or private drive network; and shall comply with the minimum standards pursuant to section 16-449, or as specifically granted in the ordinance granting the MXD district.

This Concept Plan was approved by the Roeland Park Planning Commission on October 17, 2000, and by the City Council on October 18, 2000. The 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District ("Overlay District") is established by this section, enacted to implement the goals and policies of the 47 th and Mission Road Area Concept Plan, adopted by the cities of Westwood, Roeland Park, and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas. This section translates the relevant portion of the Concept Plan within the boundaries of the City into the zoning ordinance, in addition to all current regulations. A similar ordinance will be adopted by each of the above-referenced jurisdictions to ensure consistent implementation of the 47 th and Mission Road Area Concept Plan. Sections 16-1601 through 16-1604 of the City Code establishes the 47 th and Mission Road Area Development and Management Committee as a multi-jurisdictional body to assist in implementation of the concept plan, and establish the City's involvement and representation as part of that committee. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  Property. 
(i)  This section shall apply to all property within the area of the City that is covered by the 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District, as described by the official 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District Map (including the lot and parcel number identification list), which is hereby incorporated by reference. All tracts of land covered by the 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District shall, for clarification, be identified on the zoning map by adding the designation "47M-O." 
(ii)  The standards in this section shall apply to all property currently or subsequently zoned for commercial or multi-family use. 
(iii)  Any property zoned for single-family residential use shall be subject to the restrictions of this section to indicate neighborhood areas to be protected by commercial use or multi-family use buffers and design enhancements established in this section. In addition, to further protect existing neighborhoods, any property currently zoned for single-family residential use, which is subsequently rezoned to multi-family or commercial uses, must satisfy all design standards in this section. 
(2)  Type of development. These standards shall be applied to new development, re-development, or exterior modifications that significantly alter the appearance of a building or site within the area covered by the 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District ordinance including, but not limited to, building additions, façade improvements, or landscaping improvements. Only those standards required by this section and directly related to proposed development, redevelopment, or exterior modification shall be applied. 
(3)  Non-conforming uses. Site conditions and other current circumstances on tracts of land within the area covered by the 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District, which came into being lawfully, but which do not conform to this chapter, shall be allowed to continue to exist and the land shall be allowed to be put to productive use, but the overall intent of this chapter is to cause as many aspects of these types of uses to be brought into conformance with the regulations of this chapter as is reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, development on tracts of land within the 47 th and Mission Road Area Design Review Overlay District shall be required to comply with this chapter when a use that came into being lawfully, but which does not conform to this chapter, has ceased for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days (except where government action causes cessation). 
(4)  Other regulations. Within the overlay district, all City Code provisions, policies, regulations, and plans shall apply. Where conflicts occur regarding development standards in this section, the standards established in this section shall supersede those in the conflicting ordinance, policy, regulation, or plan. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section.

ARTICLE 9. - SIGN REGULATIONS 

Sec. 16-901. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to create the framework for a comprehensive and balanced system of content- and viewpoint-neutral regulation of signs to facilitate easy and pleasant communication between people while protecting the First Amendment rights of resident individuals and businesses of the City and preserving and improving the quality of the City's environment by avoiding visual clutter harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities, and community appearance. With these purposes in mind, it is the intent of these regulations: 
(a)  To authorize the use of signs that are: 
(1)  Compatible with their surroundings, 
(2)  Appropriate to the activity that displays them, 
(3)  Expressive of the identity of individual activities and the community as a whole, and 
(4)  Legible under the circumstances in which they are seen; and 
(b)  To ensure that nonconforming signs are eliminated in the City after a reasonable grace period that allows sign owners to recoup their initial investments in those nonconforming signs. 
Sec. 16-902. - Findings and Intent; Interpretation. 
(a)  Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and conditions of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic investment. This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all Signs. This article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. This article is based on the following legislative intent and findings. 
(1)  A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of the land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure that they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for the intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified above. 
(2)  These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
(3)  These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above. 
(4)  These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
(5)  These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the federal government, the State of Kansas, Johnson County, or this City. The inclusion of "government" in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps illustrate the type of signs that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation. 
(6)  Many signs are intended to be temporary in nature, and so do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and present a potential hazard to persons and property. Severe weather conditions include, but are not limited to, thunderstorms with accompanying high winds, tornadoes, ice accumulation, and flooding, and are characteristic of local weather conditions. 
(7)  The primary purpose of signs unrelated to traffic and placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions. This concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers. 
(8)  Signs inherently are out of keeping with their surroundings; they are intended to attract attention. Their purpose fails if they meld into the landscape. As such, they are a visual blight where the visual clutter of signs is at odds with the City's policy to make structures blend into the topography and be compatible with their natural surroundings. 
(9)  Signs have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of a City, and thus risk depreciating property values. This potential adverse effect conflicts with the City's policy to enhance the quality of life through other land use regulations. 
(10)  Residents are virtually captive audiences of signs displayed by neighbors; signs are an intrusion into residential privacy and interfere with the enjoyment of a resident's property because the vista from the resident's property may become so marred by the clutter of signs that the resident cannot successfully avoid observing the sign clutter.

Sec. 16-904. - Regulations Generally. 
    Other than lawful nonconforming signs, no signs shall be permitted in any zoning district of the City except in accordance with these provisions. 
Sec. 16-905. - Computations.

(a)  Computation of sign surface area of individual signs. The area of a sign surface (that is also the sign area of a wall sign or any or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by measuring the area of the smallest circle, square, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming integral part of the background of the sign or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or sign structure against which it is placed, but not including the sign structure or decorative fence or wall between the fence or wall otherwise meet zoning ordinance regulations and that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(b)  Computation of area of multi-face signs. The sign surface area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign surfaces on the sign. 
(c)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lowest of (a) existing grade prior to construction, or (b) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower. 
Sec. 16-906. - Prohibited Signs. 
    The following types of signs shall be prohibited, except where specifically permitted in this article: 
(a)  Any sign that is not otherwise included as a type of sign authorized hereby.

(k)  Any sign giving false statements concerning zoning or land use.

In any appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the action of the Building Inspector at its next regularly scheduled meeting, but not later than 30 days after notice of appeal is received by the City Clerk, and if it determines that the action of the Building Inspector was incorrect, shall order the issuance of the permit under the terms and conditions as are appropriate. 
(e)  In certain instances, as specifically designated in these regulations, the Planning Commission shall consider and approve or deny sign permit applications. In this instance, the Building Inspector shall not issue a sign permit unless the Planning Commission has first approved the subject sign permit application. The Planning Commission shall consider the sign permit application within the time frames set forth hereinabove for the Building Inspector to either issue or deny the sign permit. If the Planning Commission denies the sign permit application, the applicant may appeal the Planning Commission's denial to the Governing Body by giving written notice to the City Clerk not later than 20 days after the Planning Commission's denial. The applicant shall be provided written notice of the Planning Commission's consideration of the sign permit application and the Governing Body's review of the applicant's appeal of the Planning Commission's denial, if the appeal is requested. The Governing Body shall consider the sign permit applicant's appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting and the time frame for the Building Inspector to issue or deny the sign permit shall be deferred until two working days after the Governing Body has heard the sign permit applicant's appeal. 
(f)  All rights and privileges acquired pursuant to this article, or any amendment hereto, are mere licenses and are revocable at any time by the City for cause, and all permits shall contain this provision.

(Ord. No. 941 Revised, § 4, 4-17-2017) 
Sec. 16-909. - Signs Permitted In All Districts. 
(a)  Churches, synagogues, and other similar places of worship, schools, libraries, community centers, or other public or semi-public facilities shall be allowed two wall signs, with not more than one on each façade. No sign shall have a sign surface area exceeding 25 square feet. In lieu of one of the wall signs, one monument sign shall be permitted. The monument sign shall be located on the premises, be not less than ten feet from the street line, and the sign surface of each sign face shall not exceed 25 square feet in area per face. The height of the sign shall not exceed five feet; provided, that for each two-foot setback from the street line in excess of ten feet, one additional foot may be added to the height of the sign to a maximum of eight feet. 
(b)  One directional sign shall be permitted at each entrance to a building site. These signs may be a pole or pylon sign, single- or two-faced and shall not exceed three feet in height, and four square feet of sign surface per face. These signs may indicate entrances, exits, addresses, direction of traffic-flow and the location of loading docks, parking areas, delivery doors, drive-through lanes and similar facilities. The sign shall be located on the premises and shall be set back from the street line a minimum of five feet. 
(c)  Official governmental jurisdiction flags, including flags indicating weather conditions, and flags that are emblems of religious, charitable, public and nonprofit organizations. No flag shall exceed 50 square feet in area. 
(d)  Noncommercial signs, provided that these signs shall conform to all sign surface and sign type area, height, setback, location, construction and maintenance requirements applicable to all other signs in the zoning district in which the noncommercial sign is located as set forth in this article or any other applicable provisions of the Code. No sign shall be displayed on private property without the written consent of the owner or occupant of the property on which the sign is displayed. 
(e)  Although these regulations do not apply to signs constructed, placed or maintained by federal, state or local governments, these regulations clarify that government signs which form the expression of that government are allowed in every zoning district and include the signs described and/or required in the following subsections (1) through (4) when erected and maintained pursuant to law. 
(1)  Traffic control devices on public or private property must be erected and maintained so as to comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted by the Kansas Secretary of Transportation pursuant to K.S.A. 8-2003, and amendments thereto. Because these regulations do not apply to the federal, state or local governments, a failure to comply with this provision by those governments does not constitute evidence of negligence or form the basis for a cause of action. 
(2)  Each property owner shall mark their property using numerals that identify the address of the property so that public safety agencies can easily identify the address from the public street. Where required under this Code or other law, the identification must be on the curb or the principal building on the property. When located on a building, the size and location of the identifying numerals and letters, if any, must be proportional to the size of the building and the distance from the street to the building. In cases where the building is not located within view of the public street, the address identification must be located on a mailbox or other suitable display in the front yard that is visible from the street. 
(3)  Where a federal, state or local law requires a property owner to post a sign on the owner's property to warn of a danger, to restrict access to the property either generally or specifically, or to advise of the existence os security systems, the owner must comply with the federal, state or local regulation to exercise that authority by posting a sign on the property. If the federal, state or local regulation describes the form and dimensions of the sign, the property owner must comply with those requirements. Otherwise, when the form and dimensions are not defined, and it is located on a building, fence or other structure, the sign and location of the warning sign must be proportional to the size of the structure and the distance from the street, but in no case larger than one and a half square feet. A warning sign may also be installed in a place on the property to provide access to the notice that is required to be made, but in no case shall the sign be larger than one and a half square feet and shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the street line. 
(4)  Official notices or advertisements may be posted or displayed by or under the direction of any public or court officer in the performance of official or directed duties. If the federal, state or local regulation describes the form and dimensions of the office notice or advertisement, the property owner must comply with those requirements; otherwise, when not defined, the sign shall be no larger than six square feet and located on a place on the property to provide access to the notice that is required to be made. Provided, that all such signs must be removed by the property owner nor more than ten days after their purpose has been accomplished or as otherwise required by law. 
The signs described in subsections (1) through (4) above are an important component of measures necessary to protect the public safety and serve the compelling governmental interests of protecting the public and traffic safety, complying with legal requirements, serving the requirements of emergency response and protecting property rights or the rights of persons on property. 
(Ord. No. 941 Revised, § 5, 4-17-2017)

For lots with more than one building, each building having a footprint of 2,000 square feet or larger is allowed signage in accordance with the provisions stated above. For example, a lot with two buildings each with 2,000 square foot footprints would be allowed these three signs per building or six signs total. Where more than three signs are used in this case no building may have more than these three signs near each building, with each building area defined by imaginary lines midway between each building. All temporary signs must be set back a minimum of five feet from the street line and only three signs can be associated with one building.

For purposes of this section, the terms "shopping centers, business parks, office parks or industrial parks" shall mean a project of one or more buildings that has been planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time that zoning was approved by the City. The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt the project or portions thereof from complying with these regulations relative to the number of detached signs, harmony and visual quality of signs to be installed. 
Sec. 16-916. - Removal of Unsafe, Unlawful or Abandoned Signs. 
(a)  If the Building Inspector shall find that any sign regulated herein is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, or, has been constructed or erected, or is being maintained in violation of this article or Chapter IV, Article 9 of the Code, the Building Inspector shall give notice thereof to the permittee, or, if the sign is one that does not require a permit, to the owner of the property on which the sign is located.

The Building Inspector shall refuse to issue a permit to any permittee or owner who refuses to pay costs so assessed. The Building Inspector may cause any sign which is an immediate peril to persons or property to be removed summarily and without notice.

No changes in the basic structure, source of illumination, location or appearance of a sign, sign alteration, or sign refacing shall be made to any sign. If the business to which the sign is related should move to another site (which move, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, creates, in effect, an outdoor advertising sign) then the sign shall be removed or otherwise brought into full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code. 
(b)  Upon application to the City Clerk, the Governing Body may extend the time for discontinuance and/or removal of a nonconforming sign. No extension of time shall be granted for a period of time longer than that necessary to allow the owner of the sign to recoup the owner's initial investment in the nonconforming sign.

(iv)  An omni-directional Antenna placed at the top of the Tower when it gives the appearance of being a similarly sized or smaller extension of the Tower. (The latter will be included in the Tower height calculation.) 
b.  Design on Base Stations. Antennas and visible Accessory Facilities on a Base Station or other building/structure shall be comprised of materials that are consistent with the surrounding elements so as to blend architecturally with said building/structure and to camouflage their appearance in a Stealth manner. Such facilities on rooftops may require screening that is architecturally compatible with the building. As applicable, the following additional requirements apply: 
(i)  Antennas may be installed on any existing building or structure (such as a water Tower but excluding single-family residences and accessory uses) three stories in height or greater but no less than 35 feet provided that the additional Antennas shall add no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure. 
(ii)  Antennas which are architecturally compatible to the building architecture may locate on non-residential buildings less than three stories or 35 feet in height, subject to final development plan approval (certificate of conformity in DFD district). 
(iii)  Attached Antennas on a roof shall be located as close to the center of the roof as possible; and Antennas mounted on a building or structure wall shall be as flush to the wall as technically possible, and shall not project above the top of the wall. 
(iv)  Accessory Facilities for Antennas may be permitted on the roof so long as it is screened from view in accordance with Section 16-1010. (For ground-mounted Accessory Facilities see Section 16-1107.) 
c.  Color and Finish. Antennas and visible Accessory Facilities shall be colored and finished in a manner consistent with the Tower/Base Station and any surrounding elements so as to camouflage their appearance in a Stealth manner. Such facilities shall be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the Tower/Base Station so as to make such facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible. Antennas mounted on the side of a building or structure shall be painted to match the color of the building or structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen. 
(c)  Setbacks. 
(1)  Communications Facilities in commercial and industrial zoning districts shall meet the setback requirements for other types of commercial structures of a similar size that are allowed by right in the zoning district in which the facilities are located. In the event the Communications Facilities will exceed the height allowed for other types of commercial structures in the district in which the facilities are located, the Communications Facilities shall meet the greater of the maximum setback requirements for the zoning district or a setback equal to the height of the facility, unless the Approval Authority reasonably finds that a greater setback is required in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Communications Facilities in residential zoning districts shall meet the greater of the maximum setback requirements for the zoning district or a setback equal to the height of the facility, unless the Approval Authority reasonably finds that a greater setback is required in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. Setbacks for Towers located on residentially zoned property which is shown on the Comprehensive Plan for a use other than very-low density or low density residential shall be determined at the time of the Application. 
(3)  In addition to the above setback requirements set forth in subsections C.1 and C.2, Towers shall have a minimum setback of 200 feet from any surrounding property which is zoned as Single-Family Residence District, unless such Tower: (1) does not exceed the height requirement for other types of commercial structures in the district in which the Tower is located; (2) is a utility pole or street light or a Monopole similar in size thereof; or (3) is designed as an architecturally compatible element in terms of material, design and height to the Existing or proposed use of the Site. 
(4)  Small Cell/DAS Facilities on utility poles or street lights shall not be subject to the setback requirements in subsections C.1-C.3 above. 
(5)  The Approval Authority shall have the ability to grant a deviation from the setback requirements above subject to subsection 16-429(g). 
(d)  Accessory Facilities. Accessory Facilities shall include only such structures and facilities necessary for transmission functions for Wireless Services, but shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicle storage areas, or other similar uses not necessary for the transmission function. Accessory Facilities shall be constructed of building materials consistent with the primary use of the Site and shall be subject to the applicable approval process. Where there is no primary use other than the Communications Facility, the Accessory Facility and the building materials for the Accessory Facility shall be subject to the review and approval of the Approval Authority. 
(e)  Equipment Storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a Communications Facility shall not be stored or parked on the Site of the Communications Facility unless repairs to the Communications Facility are being made or pursuant to emergency approval as set forth in Section 16-1109. 
(f)  Parking Areas and Drives. All parking areas and drives associated with the Communications Facility shall comply with Section 16-802, except that the Approval Authority may waive the requirements for curbing and drainage facilities when they are not needed for drainage purposes. All access roads and turn-arounds shall be provided to ensure adequate emergency and service access. 
(g)  Screening. Accessory Facilities located at the base of a Tower or Base Station shall be screened from view with a solid screen wall a minimum of six feet in height. The materials of the wall, including any proposed razor wire or other security wire, shall be of a material designed to match the architecture of the surrounding structures, and shall be subject to the review and approval of the Approval Authority. The landowner or provider shall be responsible for maintenance of the screening. The Approval Authority shall have the ability to waive or reasonably modify this requirement where the design of the Accessory Facility is architecturally compatible to the primary use of the Site or where the Accessory Facility will have no visible impact on the public right-of-way and any other nearby property. 
(h)  Landscaping. A landscape plan shall be required in accordance with Section 16-1004. The landscape plan shall be sealed by a professional landscape architect, unless this requirement is waived by the Approval Authority. A continuous landscaped area shall be provided around the perimeter of the accessory building or screening wall; and utility boxes will comply with any applicable utility box screening requirement. All plant materials are subject to Section 16-1006 and shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting materials. Drought tolerant plant materials are encouraged. The owner or provider shall be responsible for maintenance of all approved landscaping. Where the visual impact of the equipment building would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Approval Authority. 
(i)  Lighting. Communications Facilities shall only be illuminated as required by the FCC and/or the FAA. If lighting is required, the Approval Authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Security lighting around the base of a Tower may be provided if the lighting is shielded so that: no light is directed towards adjacent properties or rights-of-ways; the lighting avoids illuminating the Tower; and the lighting meets any other applicable City requirements. 
(j)  Utilities. All utilities at a Communications Facility Site shall be installed underground and in compliance with applicable codes. 
(k)  Security. All Communications Facilities shall be located, fenced, or otherwise secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. 
(l)  Signage. Signage at the Site is limited to non-illuminated warning and equipment identification signs required by the FCC or applicable regulatory body or otherwise approved by the Approval Authority. 
(m)  Building Codes and Inspection. 
(1)  Construction and Maintenance Standards. To ensure structural integrity, Communications Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with the standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for Communications Facilities published by the Electronic Industries Association, (EIA) or any applicable regulatory authority (all as amended from time to time). If upon inspection the City concludes that a Communications Facility fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then the facility owner or landowner shall have 30 days following written notice to bring such facility into compliance. If the facility owner or landowner fails to bring such facility into compliance within this period, the City may order the removal or cause the removal of such facility at the facility owner or landowner's expense. Failure of the City to inspect the facility shall not relieve the facility owner or landowner of their responsibility to comply with this provision. 
(2)  Inspection. At least every 24 months, the Communications Facility shall be inspected by an expert who is regularly involved in the maintenance, inspection and/or erection of Communications Facilities. At a minimum, this inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the inspection checklist provided in the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) Standard 222, Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Support Structures (as amended from time to time). A copy of the inspection record shall be provided to the City upon request. The inspection shall be conducted at the facility owner or landowner's expense. 
(n)  Operational Standards. 
(1)  Communications Facilities shall meet or exceed all minimum structural, height, radio frequency radiation and other operational standards as established by the FCC, FAA, EPA and other applicable federal regulatory agencies. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the Communications Facilities shall be brought into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of the ordinance or law from which these standards and regulations are derived, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring Communications Facilities into compliance with any revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the facility at the owner or provider's expense. 
(2)  It is the responsibility of the Wireless Service provider to promptly resolve any electromagnetic interference problems in accordance with any applicable law or FCC regulation. 
(o)  Removal of Abandoned Communications Facilities. Any Communications Facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and a nuisance, and the owner of such facility or the landowner shall remove the same within 90 days of a receipt of notice from the City. If such facility is not removed within said 90 days, the City may remove such facility at the facility owner or landowner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single Tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the Tower. 
(p)  Unsafe Communications Facilities. Any Communications Facility which is not maintained to a suitable degree of safety and appearance (as determined by the City and any applicable code, statute, ordinance, law, regulations or standard) will be considered a nuisance and will be upgraded or removed at the owner or provider's expense. 
(Ord. No. 944, § 20, 11-21-2016) 
Sec. 16-1108. - Application Denial. 
(a)  The City may deny an Application for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to submit any or all required Application documents and information. 
(2)  Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements. 
(3)  Conflict with the historic nature or character of the surrounding area pursuant to federal or state law. 
(4)  The use or construction of a Communications Facility which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use designation. 
(5)  The placement and location of the Communications Facility would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, businesses, City employees, or employees of the Wireless Service provider. 
(6)  Conflict with a public health, safety and welfare issue, including, but not limited to, violation of noise ordinance, flashing or other light nuisance, and conflict with required sidewalk widths (including ADA accessibility requirements). 
(7)  Conflict with planned future public improvements. 
(8)  Conflict with or violation of any provision contained within this Chapter or any other applicable City code or with any applicable federal or state law. 
(b)  In the event of a denial, the Approval Authority or the City shall notify the Applicant in writing of the City's final decision, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record and issued contemporaneously. Such notice shall be made within the applicable timeframe set forth in subsection 16-1104.C. 
(c)  Any denial shall not discriminate against the Applicant with respect to the placement of Communications Facilities of other investor-owned utilities, Wireless Service providers, wireless infrastructure providers or wireless carriers. 
(Ord. No. 944, § 21, 11-21-2016) 
Sec. 16-1109. - Emergencies and Disasters. 
    In the event of a declared emergency or disaster, the City Administrator or the Building Official may authorize any temporary Towers, Base Stations, Transmission Equipment or Accessory Equipment necessary to temporarily restore Wireless Services. 
(Ord. No. 944, § 22, 11-21-2016) 
Sec. 16-1110. - Interpretation and Severability. 
    The provisions of this Article shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal, state and local laws and standards regulating Communications Facilities. In the event any federal or state law or standard is mandatory or is more stringent than provisions of this Article, then such provisions shall be revised accordingly. If any section, subsection, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any reason held invalid or unenforceable by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. 
(Ord. No. 944, § 23, 11-21-2016) 
ARTICLE 12. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND VESTED RIGHTS 

Sec. 16-1201. - Nonconforming Situations; Definitions. 
    Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this article shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article. 
(a)  Expenditure. A sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation. The term also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position. 
(b)  Nonconforming dimension. A nonconforming situation that occurs when the height, size, or minimum floor area of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and the other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(c)  Nonconforming lot. A lot existing on December 19, 1991 (and not created for purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter), that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
(d)  Nonconforming project. Any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete on December 19, 1991, and would have been inconsistent with one or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which it is located, if completed as proposed or planned. 
(e)  Nonconforming sign. A sign that, on December 19, 1991, did not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this chapter. 
(f)  Nonconforming site improvement. A nonconforming situation that occurs when, on December 19, 1991, an existing site improvement on a lot, including but not limited to parking areas, storm drainage facilities, sidewalks and landscaping, no longer conformed to one or more of the regulations of this chapter applicable to the property. 
(g)  Nonconforming use. A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in any manner made unlawful by the use regulations or development and performance standards applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located. The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property. 
(h)  Nonconforming situation. A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, an existing lot, structure or improvement, or the use of an existing lot, structure or improvement no longer conforms to one or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot, structure or improvement is located. 
Sec. 16-1202. - Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completions of Nonconforming Projects. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections 16-1203 through 16-1209, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on December 19, 1991, may be continued. 
(b)  Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-1209. 
(c)  The burden shall be on the landowner or developer to establish entitlement to continuation of nonconforming situations completion of nonconforming projects. 
Sec. 16-1203. - Nonconforming Lots. 
(a)  This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. For purposes of this section, a substantial structure shall include any structure in excess of 600 square feet in floor area which was constructed for a use which was a principal use permitted in the zoning district at the time of construction. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished only in accordance with Section 16-1206. 
(b)  When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum lot area applicable to that zoning district, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size of a particular district is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(c)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects, but the applicable setback requirements cannot be complied with, then the Governing Body may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that: 
(1)  Development of the property is not reasonably possible for the use proposed without deviations; 
(2)  The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(d)  For purposes of subsection (c) above, development in compliance with the applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with the setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(e)  Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date the ordinance from which this chapter derives becomes effective, an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his or her successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where the lot is located and within 500 feet of the lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require the combination when that would be out of character with the neighborhood that has previously been developed. 
Sec. 16-1204. - Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations. 
(a)  Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if the activity results in: 
(1)  An increase in the total amount of space or building area devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
(2)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements, or other requirements such as parking requirements. 
(b)  Subject to subsection 16-1204(d), a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by the ordinance from which this chapter derives, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate this use. However, except as otherwise provided in section 16-1209, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in section 16-1209 a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming; provided, however, that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the land may be expanded to other portions of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming, if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on December 19, 1991, and where the development and performance standards otherwise applicable to a use were complied with. 
(d)  The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in-kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur. 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, any structure used as a one-family dwelling and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of the existing nonconformities with respect to these matters as setback and parking requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in section 16-1208. 
Sec. 16-1205. - Repair, Maintenance and Restoration of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists. 
(a)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures and property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure to be renovated, shall not be permitted. 
(b)  If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or restoration would not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value, then the damaged structure may be repaired or restored only in accordance with a nonconforming situation permit issued by the Building Inspector pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for one-family dwellings, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a building permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided by subsection 16-1204(e). 
(c)  Any repairs, renovation or restoration of a structure, pursuant to this section, which would require the issuance of any permit under Chapter IV of the City Code shall also require the issuance of a nonconforming situation permit by the Building Inspector. In support of the application for the permit, the applicant shall submit information as may be required to satisfy the City Engineer that the cost of the proposed repairs, renovation or restoration would not exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure. 
(d)  For purposes of this chapter: 
(1)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish the renovation, repair or restoration. 
(2)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the total cost of all intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this chapter by doing the work incrementally. 
Sec. 16-1206. - Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists. 
(a)  A change in use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) may not be made except in accordance with subsections 16-1206(b) through (e). However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. 
(b)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this title applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this title is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status. 
(c)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible only if the Governing Body issues a nonconforming situation permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the Governing Body finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter, that the intended change will not result in a violation of section 16-1204 and that all of the applicable requirements of this chapter will be complied with that are reasonably possible. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting these requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. Further, in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created. 
(d)  In making a determination under subsection 16-1206(c) whenever (1) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it, and (2) a proposed change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for the lot, and (3) the parking or loading requirements that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on these lots because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use shall not be regarded by the Governing Body as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation in violation of section 16-1204. However, if the proposed use is approved, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements than can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain off-site parking if parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the land use permit is required and the off-site parking is reasonably available. If off-site parking is not reasonably available at the time the nonconforming situation permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the nonconforming situation permit. 
Sec. 16-1207. - Nonconforming Site Improvements. 
(a)  On lots with nonconforming site improvements, no additions to, or repairs or renovations of, any structure or site improvement may be made without first either bringing the nonconforming site improvements into complete conformity with the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot is located or obtaining a nonconforming situation permit pursuant to this section. Provided, however, that this section shall not apply to the following circumstances: 
(1)  Repairs or restoration of a structure pursuant to subsection 16-1205(b); or 
(2)  Minor repairs or renovation of a structure or site improvement. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, "minor repairs or renovation" shall mean repairs or renovation costs which do not exceed ten percent of the fair market value of a structure or site improvement. 
(c)  When an addition to or repairs or renovation of, any structure or site improvement is proposed on a lot with a nonconforming site improvement(s), the Governing Body may approve a nonconforming situation permit allowing the addition or repairs or renovation if it finds that: 
(1)  The nonconforming site improvement(s) is the only nonconforming situation pertaining to the property, 
(2)  Compliance with the site improvement requirements applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located is not reasonably possible, and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(d)  For purposes of subsection (c), mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance with the site improvement requirements is not reasonably possible. 
Sec. 16-1208. - Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations. 
(a)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes. 
(b)  If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the Governing Body issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. The permit may be issued if the Governing Body finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected. 
(c)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent the apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(d)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by the ordinance from which this chapter derives was vacant or discontinued on December 19, 1991, the 180-day period for purposes of this section began to run on December 19, 1991. 
Sec. 16-1209. - Completion of Nonconforming Projects-Vested Rights. 
(a)  All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before December 19, 1991, as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on December 19, 1991, may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as those permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired, and a vested rights permit is obtained from the public works director. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection 16-1209(a) or in 16-1210, all work on any nonconforming projects shall cease on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a vested rights permit issued in accordance with this section by the Governing Body. The Governing Body shall approve a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the development regulations as they existed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete its project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the Governing Body shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations: 
(1)  All expenditures made to obtain, or pursuant to a validly issued and unprovoked building, land use or sign permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the development regulations that existed before December 19, 1991. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b)(1), no expenditures made more than 180 days before December 19, 1991, may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the development regulations that existed before December 19, 1991. An expenditure is made at the time a person incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure. 
(3)  To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property. 
(4)  To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made these expenditures. 
(5)  An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the developer. 
(6)  A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development regulations affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to that person. 
(7)  Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development regulations affecting a development site, the Governing Body may still find that the person acted in good faith if the person did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. For example, the Governing Body may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures. 
(c)  When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection 16-1209(b). In addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subsection 16-1209(b)(6), the Governing Body shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in addition to other relevant factors: 
(1)  Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural or engineering work, 
(2)  Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet completed, and 
(3)  Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in a manner or location or to a scale, in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if the approved, but uncompleted, phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations. 
(d)  The Governing Body shall not consider any application for a vested rights permit authorized by subsection 16-1209(b) that is submitted more than 60 days after December 19, 1991. The Governing Body may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
Sec. 16-1210. - Completion of Single-Family Residential Developments. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the developer of a single-family residential development from developing in accordance with the terms of a final plat duly recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Johnson County. Provided, however, if construction is not commenced on any land within five years of the recording of the plat, the development rights shall expire. Provided, further, that if construction has commenced on any project, but is thereafter abandoned for a period in excess of five years, the project may only be completed in accordance with the provisions of section 16-1209. 
Sec. 16-1211. - Nonconforming Signs. 
(a)  Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, and the provisions of section 16-1208, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives may be continued. 
(b)  No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition, nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
(c)  A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced, and the message may not be changed except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this chapter, except for "sign maintenance" as defined in section 4-903 of the City Code. 
(d)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be maintained and repaired so long as the cost of the work within any 12-month period does not exceed 50 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign. No work shall be done without the person proposing to do the work first submitting information as may be required to satisfy the City Engineer that the cost of the work would not exceed 50 percent of the value of the sign. 
(e)  If a nonconforming sign, other than an outdoor advertising sign, advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days after abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over the sign. 
(f)  If a nonconforming outdoor advertising sign remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after abandonment, be altered to comply with this article or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over the sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is "blank" if: 
(1)  It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or 
(2)  The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or 
(3)  The advertising copy paid for by a person other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed. 
ARTICLE 13. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FINDING OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 16-1301. - Statutory Authorization. 
(a)  Approval of draft ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer prior to adoption. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on March 4, 2009. 
(b)  Kansas statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. 
Sec. 16-1302. - Findings of Facts. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of these flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. The base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated August 3, 2009, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
Sec. 16-1303. - Statement of Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection (a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this article to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increase in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve these uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(c)  Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes due to the flood hazard.

Sec. 16-1317. - Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in Article 2, Section A are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply: 
(a)  AO Zones. 
(1)  All new construction and substantial-improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial-improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(b)  AH Zones 
(1)  The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in Article 4, section B.

Sec. 16-1323. - Conditions for Approving Floodplain Management Variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b) through (f) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increased beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause, 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and 
(2)  The construction below the base flood level increases risk to life and property. 
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
Sec. 16-1324. - Conditions for Approving Variances for Accessory Structures. 
    Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in sections 16-1322-16-1323 of this article. In order to minimize flood damages during the one percent annual chance flood event, also referred to as the 100-year flood, and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed. 
(a)  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
(b)  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with subsection 16-1313(d) of this article. 
(c)  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with section 16-1313 of this article. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
(d)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with subsection 16-1313(d)(4) of this article. 
(e)  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with subsection 16-1313(d) of this article. 
(f)  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 16-1314(b) of this article. No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
(g)  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
(h)  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
(i)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that:

(b)  No appeal, pursuant to this section, shall be heard by the board until the individual appealing the order, requirement, decision or determination has met with the administrative official who made the determination to receive a full explanation of the zoning requirements in question as currently interpreted. No notice of appeal shall be processed until it has been deemed complete by the Building Inspector, the fee paid, and all required additional information submitted. 
(c)  The appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the board. An appeal shall be initiated by filing with the person whose decision is being appealed and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the decision being appealed from and a statement as to the reason of the appeal. The notice must be accompanied by the fee set by the Governing Body, pursuant to section 16-1505. The Building Inspector or the board may require that drawings or photos of the property in question and a list of all surrounding property owners be submitted to the board prior to consideration of the appeal by the board. 
(d)  When all requirements established in subsections (b) and (c) have been complied with, the Building Inspector shall notify the chairman and the chairman shall schedule a meeting of the board and shall send copies of the notice to the board members. At least twenty days prior to the board meeting, an official notice to the public shall be published in the official City newspaper explaining the appeal and the time and place of the scheduled hearing. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each party to the appeal and to the Planning Commission. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by an agent or by an attorney. 
(e)  An appeal stays all proceedings and furtherance of action appealed form unless the Building Inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed, that, by reason of facts stated in the notice, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. 
(f)  At its next meeting, the board shall hear all facts and testimony from all parties wishing to be heard concerning the appeal. The appeal shall be heard by the board at the next meeting following compliance with the requirements established in subsections (b), (c) and (d). 
(g)  In its deliberations, the board must only consider whether or not the interpretation in question conformed to the specific language of the ordinance being enforced. The board may not declare the zoning regulations unfair or attempt to act contrary to their purpose. The board may clarify ambiguities or resolve conflicts between opposing sections. Since the board's decisions will affect future application of the regulation in question, the specific hardship of the applicant should not be considered when reaching a determination on an appeal filed pursuant to this section. 
(h)  The board may either affirm, reverse, or modify the order, requirement or interpretation at issue. If the decision of the board is not made at the meeting where the hearing was held, a written decision, shall be mailed to affected parties. 
Sec. 16-1507. - Variances. 
(a)  When an applicant feels that the strict application of the requirements of the zoning regulations have created an undue hardship, the applicant may request a variance from the board. 
(b)  A variance should be issued only to the specific restrictions on physical construction; not to permissible land uses within a given district, and only if it reasonably constitutes the minimum variance necessary and the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
(c)  To initiate a request for a variance the applicant or his authorized agent shall submit a completed application on the form provided by the City to the building inspector and pay the appropriate fee as set forth in section 16-1505. The application shall be accompanied by a sketch map showing proposed and existing structures and uses of the property for which the variance is being requested and of immediately adjacent properties. The Building Inspector may require applicant to submit photos of the subject property. No application shall be processed until it has been deemed completed by the Building Inspector, the fee paid and all additional information submitted. 
(d)  When all requirements established in subsections (b) and (c) have been complied with, the Building Inspector shall notify the chairman, and the chairman shall schedule a regular meeting of the board and send to the board members copies of the application and all additional information submitted. At least 20 days prior to the board meeting, an official notice to the public shall be published in the official City newspaper explaining the variance request and the time and place of the scheduled hearing, and a copy of the notice shall be mailed to the applicant, the Planning Commission, and to all owners of record of lands located within 100 feet of the property which is the subject of the application for variance. The form of the notice and the procedure for providing the notice shall be in accordance with subsection (a). 
(e)  At the scheduled meeting of the board, it shall hear all facts and testimony from all parties wishing to be heard concerning the requested variance. In each case, the board shall not grant a variance unless by a vote of three members of the board finds, based upon the evidence presented, facts which conclusively support all the following findings. 
(1)  Uniqueness. The variance requested arises from conditions which are unique to the property in question, which are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district, and which are not caused by the action of the property owners or applicant. These conditions include the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved which would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for the applicant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the requested variance was not granted. 
(2)  Adjacent property. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents 
(3)  Hardship. The strict application of the provisions of the zoning regulations from which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. Although the desire to increase the profitability of the property may be an indication of hardship, it shall not be a sufficient reason by itself to justify the variance. 
(4)  Public interest. The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, or general welfare of the community. The proposed variance shall not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(5)  Spirit and intent. Granting the request for variance should not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations. 
(f)  The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing evidence presented, findings of fact by the board, decisions of the board and the vote upon each question. Records of all official actions of the board shall be filed in City hall and shall be public record. 
(g)  The board may either grant, grant conditionally, or deny the application for a variance. If the decision of the board is not made at the meeting at which the hearing was held, a written decision shall be sent to affected parties and the Planning Commission. 
Sec. 16-1508. - Appeals From Board of Zoning Appeals. 
    Any person or an official of a government agency dissatisfied with any order or determination of the board may bring an action to determine the reasonableness of any order or determination within thirty days after the making of the order or determination, in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas.

Section 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION. In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise.

Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. 
Section 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. 
(1)  The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair.

Section 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE. The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

b.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not: 
(1)  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;

c.  As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC).

Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to $1.20 per Access Line per month for each residential service Access Line and $2.00 per Access Line per month for commercial service Access Line, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to a Gross Receipts fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Gross Receipts fee shall not exceed 5% of Gross Receipts.

c.  Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
d.  Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
e.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. 
f.  The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.

The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
i.  Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance. 
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS. It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee's Facilities. 
    Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way. 
    The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors.

SECTION 10.  Exclusive Use of Franchise Right by Franchisee. The rights granted to franchisee by this franchise agreement to use the public right-of-way shall be for the sole use of franchisee. Franchise use is limited to the University public use that franchisee has filed with the City in accordance with Section 8 and 9 of this agreement.

SECTION 13.  Franchisee's Operating Regulations. Franchisee shall have the authority to promulgate any rules, regulations and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable franchisee to exercise its rights and to perform its obligations under its franchise or City policy.

With respect to extension of service to new areas within the City, franchisee shall file in the office of the City Clerk the rules and regulations governing franchisee's extension of service to these new areas. If the City has not filed its written objection to any or all of these rules and regulations with franchisee within thirty (30) days after they are filed by franchisee, said rules and regulations shall be deemed approved. Franchisee may thereafter change these rules and regulations by filing these changes as hereinbefore provided, and the same shall be approved or rejected in a like manner.

SECTION 14.  Preference of Franchise Facility Placement. 
(a)  Preferred Placement. All facilities installed within the City shall use and occupy the public right-of-way if at all possible, in accordance with the Roeland Park Code. The City discourages the use of private easements for the placement of facilities. If private easements are necessitated, franchisee shall cooperate with the City by informing City staff of the location of any and all private easements expected to be negotiated. The City does hereby expressly reserve the right to make certain requests on the placement of utilities in private easements to limit or eliminate future street improvement relocation expenses. 
(b)  Placement Standards. All facilities constructed or relocated within the right-of-way shall be placed underground unless otherwise agreed to by the City. Underground placement of facilities shall comply with all existing City standards as well as the following standards: 
(1)  Cables shall be buried a minimum of 24 inches below the finished grade along improved streets or 24 inches below the proposed finished grade adjacent to unimproved streets. 
(2)  Cables shall be buried no closer than 3 feet from the back of the curb and gutter preferably as far from the curb and gutter as possible. 
(3)  Facilities shall be placed in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where placement is not otherwise regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from these public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by the public improvement. 
(4)  Franchisee shall not erect any poles within the City unless approval is obtained in advance from the City. This approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Above ground placement of facilities shall comply with the standards provided by the City. 
SECTION 15.   Construction Standards. The Construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, dismantling and maintenance of franchisee's facilities shall be in accordance with good engineering practices and shall be in compliance with present and future laws, ordinances and regulation, including the National Electric Code, the National Electrical Safety Code, the Fiber Optic Cable Installation Standard of the Telecommunications Industry Committee, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated by federal, state, City and any other political subdivisions thereof or an administrative agency with jurisdiction. All transmissions and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, easements and swales, sidewalks, alleys, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, easements and swales, sidewalks, alleys or other public ways and places. Franchisee shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the public streets or public ways of the City without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the Director of Public Works of the City and having received a permit for those improvements from the Director. All pole and above ground facilities must be in compliance with current City standards. 
SECTION 16.  Franchise Facility Construction/Repair/Maintenance. 
(a)  Permits Requirement. Prior to any work being done within existing public right-of-way, franchisee or its agents shall first obtain necessary permits from the City's Public Works Department. 
(b)  Notice of Work. Franchisee shall notify the City not less than three (3) working days in advance of any construction, reconstruction, repair, location or relocation of facilities that would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow to less than two lanes of moving traffic. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by franchisee, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the City. The City shall follow its policies in the granting or denial of that authority, which shall not be unreasonably delayed. In addition, all work performed in the traveled way or that in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected. All signing shall be in conformance with the latest edition of the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, unless otherwise agreed to by the City. 
(c)  Safety. Franchisee shall at all times employ a standard of care attendant to the risks involved and shall construct, operate and maintain commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failure and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury and nuisance to the public. Additionally, all facilities shall be kept in a suitable condition and in good order and repair so as not to endanger or interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic on City streets. 
(d)  Disturbances and Damages. Any disturbance or damage to a street or public property caused by franchisee during the course of constructing, operating or maintaining its facilities shall be replaced or restored to as good or better condition as before the disturbance or damage in accord with the City's established public works standards at the sole expense of franchisee. The City Public Works Director or his agent shall have the full and exclusive authority to determine if the quality of that replacement or restoration is adequate and satisfactory. In the event any street or property is not adequately and satisfactorily replaced or restored, the Public Works Director or his agent shall have the authority to require franchisee to do any necessary work to place that street or property in that condition, or the City can do or contract for work to be done at franchisee's sole expense. 
(e)  City Inspection of Activities and Facilities. At the completion of any work done within the existing public right-of-way, franchisee must notify the City's Public Works Department. Inspections of completed work may be performed and franchisee shall be responsible for the costs to perform the inspection. Failure to notify the City of the completion of work or failure to comply with the inspection process shall be a violation of this franchise agreement. 
(f)  Vegetation. Franchisee shall have authority to trim trees and shrubbery upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and other public places of the City so as to prevent trees and shrubbery from coming in contact and interfering with the facilities of franchisee; provided that, all trimming shall be limited to that absolutely necessary to ensure reliable service to franchisee's customers. All trimming shall be at the sole expense of franchisee. 
SECTION 17.  Requirement to Coordinate Construction/Repair/Maintenance Activities. Prior to the end of each calendar year, the City will provide franchisee with a copy of the City's annual capital improvements program. At the same time, each calendar year, franchisee shall provide the City with similar information, including advance notice of all known new construction and all relocation of facilities located in the City public right-of-way or in private easements proposed for the next upcoming year. Construction shall be coordinated and scheduled to minimize public inconvenience, disruption and damage to the public right-of-way. 
SECTION 18.  Requirement to Temporarily Move Wires. On the request of any new applicant, franchisee shall remove or raise or lower its wires temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. The expense of the temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the party or parties requesting the same, and franchisee may require payment in advance. Franchisee shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days written notice from the applicant detailing the time and location of the moving operations, and not less than 24-hours advance notice form the applicant advising of the actual operation. 
SECTION 19.  Use of Poles and other Facilities by Other Parties. Nothing in this franchise agreement shall be construed to require or permit any cable, telephone, electric light, or power wire attachments by either the City or franchisee on the poles or other facilities of the other. If such attachments are desired by the City or franchisee, then a separate non-contingent agreement shall be a prerequisite to those attachments. 
SECTION 20.  Abandonment and Unusable Facilities. 
If franchisee abandons facilities in the right-of-way franchisee must either: 
(a)  Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The Public Works Director may allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the Public Works Director determines that it is in the best interest of public safety to do so. At that time, the City may take ownership and responsibility of these vacated facilities left in place; or 
(b)  Provide information satisfactory to the City that the franchisee's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another authorized franchisee holder; or 
(c)  Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the City. If the franchisee proceeds under this section, the City may, at its option purchase the equipment, require the franchisee, at its own expense, to remove it, or require the franchisee to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities. 
If franchisee fails to comply with this section, and those facilities remain unused for two (2) years, shall be deemed to be abandoned after the City has made a good faith effort to contact the franchisee, unless the City receives confirmation that the franchisee intends to use the facilities. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the franchisee. 
SECTION 21.  Nondiscrimination Clause. The privilege to use or to occupy the public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory fashion. This franchise agreement shall not be less burdensome nor more favorable than any other similar franchise granted, and nothing in this franchise agreement shall be construed to favor one franchisee over another similar franchisee. City and franchisee acknowledge that this section shall not be construed to prohibit differentiation between franchises such as the present that is being granted without charge to a public institution district for noncommercial public purposes and franchises granted to entities engaged in commercial activity. 
SECTION 22.  Nonexclusive Clause. The privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain franchisee's facilities and to use or to occupy the public right-of-way is nonexclusive. The City expressly reserves the right to grant other nonexclusive franchises to other persons. However, no such additional franchises shall in any way affect the rights or obligations of franchisee. 
SECTION 23.  Duty to Indemnify the City. To the extent permitted by the Kansas Tort Claims Act, (K.S.A. 75-6101 et seq.),, franchisee shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, the members of the Governing Body, the Mayor, and all other officials, employees and agents of the City when acting in their capacity as municipal officials, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits proceedings, and actions, liability and judgment by other persons for damages, losses, costs and expenses, including attorney fees or otherwise, arising out of franchisee's construction, repair, maintenance and use of its facilities in the public right-of-way. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the City, the members of the Governing Body, the Mayor, and all other officials, employees and agents when acting in their capacity as municipal officials, employees and agents from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense. This participation shall not, under any circumstances, relieve franchisee from its duty to defend against liability or its duty to pay any judgment entered against the City, the members of the Governing Body, the Mayor, and all other officials, employees and agents. 
SECTION 24.  Liability Insurance Requirement. Franchisees shall require all contractors performing work in connection with this franchise agreement to obtain, maintain and keep in force during the time they are involved in performance of services or other work herein liability insurance, in an amount not less than the minimums set by the City, insuring against loss or damage from personal injury, death or property damage occasioned by the contractor's installation of cable into franchisee's facility, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred. The City and Franchisee and any other person or entity required by this franchise agreement, and all their assigns, subsidiaries and affiliates shall be included as additional insureds under contractor's furnished insurance (except Workers' Compensation Insurance), for ongoing and completed operations, using ISO Additional Insured Endorsement (CG 20 10), edition date 11/85, or an equivalent (e.g., CG 20 10, edition date 10/93, plus CG 20 37, edition date 10/01), under the commercial general liability policy. Said insurance shall be written on an OCCURRENCE basis, and shall be PRIMARY and NON-CONTRIBUTING. Franchisee or its contractor shall file with the City Clerk evidence of such insurance and additional insured endorsements. 
SECTION 25.  Franchisee is Without Remedy Against the City. Franchisee shall have no remedy or recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of this franchise agreement, or because of the enforcement thereof by the City, or for the failure of the City to have the authority to grant all, or any part, of the franchise granted. Second, franchisee expressly acknowledges that it accepted the franchise granted in reliance upon its independent and personal investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant this franchise conferred upon franchisee. Third, franchisee acknowledges by its acceptance of the franchise that it has not been induced to enter into the franchise upon any understanding, or promise, whether given verbally or in writing by or on behalf of the City, or by another other person concerning any term or condition of this franchise not expressed in this franchise agreement. Finally, franchisee acknowledges by the acceptance of this franchise that it has carefully read the provisions, terms and conditions of this franchise agreement and is willing to, and does accept, all of the risk attendant to the provisions, terms, and conditions. 
SECTION 26.  No Liability for City Damage to Franchise System. The City shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any of franchisee's facilities within the public right-of-way as a result of or in connection with any public improvement work by or on behalf of the City, provided that such damage or loss is not directly and proximately caused by willful, intentional or malicious acts of the City. 
SECTION 27.  Duty to Comply with State and Federal Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this franchise agreement to the contrary, the construction, operation and maintenance of franchisee's facilities by franchisee or his agent shall be in accordance with all laws and regulations of the United States and the several states and any political subdivision thereof, or any administrative agency thereof, having jurisdiction over said franchise facilities, In addition, franchisee shall meet or exceed the most stringent technical standards set by regulatory bodies, including the City, now or hereafter having jurisdiction. Franchisee's failure to comply with any law or regulation governing the operation of franchise facilities may result in a forfeiture of the privileges conferred by this franchise agreement, when so determined by the City as adopted by ordinance at one of its regular meetings. 
SECTION 28.  Notice of Filings with Regulatory Agencies. Franchisee is hereby required to file in the office of the City Clerk copies of any and all petitions, applications, and communications submitted or filed by franchisee with the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matter affecting the operation of a franchise system. 
SECTION 29.  Renegotiation During Term of Franchise. The City may renegotiate the franchise during the term of the franchise for any reason set forth herein: 
(a)  New Developments. It shall be the policy of the City to amend reasonably or renegotiate this franchise agreement upon the application of new technologies when necessary, to enable franchisee to take advantage of new developments, services or material improvements to existing technology and services during the term of the franchise. 
(b)  Sale or Transfer. The sale or transfer of franchisee's facilities or any portion thereof, or any right, title or interest in the same, or the transfer of any rights under this franchise to any other person may be grounds for renegotiation of the franchise during the term of the franchise. 
(c)  Expansion of Service. In the event franchisee desires to expand its system beyond the plans agreed upon, that expansion shall not commence without notification and/or renegotiation of this franchise agreement. The City shall exclusively decide if renegotiation is necessary. 
(d)  Local Equity. In the event franchisee is granted a system franchise in any other political subdivision within Johnson County, Kansas, and the provisions of such franchise are more favorable to such political subdivision thereof than the provisions of the franchise granted under this franchise agreement, then the City shall have the right to request franchisee to modify and amend the provisions of the franchise granted under this franchise agreement to conform to any such more favorable provisions contained in the franchise of the other political subdivision. Franchisee may offer to the City evidence and statements distinguishing any other franchise from the franchise granted under this franchise agreement, or evidence of the existence of state or federal laws or rules preventing franchisee from making the change requested by the City. Further, in the event the City shall request franchisee to amend and modify the franchise in the manner hereinabove provided, and the City determines that franchisee has not offered sufficient evidence and statements to justify its refusal to grant the City's request, then, either the City or franchisee may refer the City's request for arbitration as provided for in the laws of the State of Kansas then existing and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusory upon said parties (except that the arbitrator may not compel franchisee to be in noncompliance with any state or federal law or rules which take precedence over this franchise agreement). Finally, in the event the City's request is submitted for arbitration, the arbitrator may not consider, nor shall the arbitrator effect, the then existing provisions of the franchise except as herein provided. 
(e)  Providing Service Outside School District Charging Fee. 
SECTION 30. Consideration. 
(a)  Facility Access by the City. 
(1)  Facility Access. As consideration for franchisee's privilege to use and occupy the public right-of-way, the City shall, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth hereafter, be entitled to access to franchisee's facilities. The right to access created by this paragraph is not intended to and shall not create a duty on the part of franchisee to provide any access to the City if that access has the effect of delaying, interfering with, or limiting the ability of franchisee to provide those services for which the system may be used, now or in the future. If at any time franchisee reasonably determines, in its sole discretion, that the City's access to franchisee's facilities is or may delay, interfere with, or limit the ability of franchisee to provide services for which the system may be used, franchisee may terminate the City's right to access the facilities. Implementation of this paragraph shall require a separate and additional agreement establishing the terms and conditions that permit access by the City and that best serve the public interest. 
(2)  Emergency Use of Franchisee's Cable. In the event of a civil disaster or other emergency which occurs within the City, franchisee shall, upon request of the Mayor or designated representative, permit the City to transmit information over franchisee's cable regarding the nature and extent of the disaster or emergency as may be required to protect the safety and welfare of citizens of the City, provided that any such transmission shall occur by or with the assistance of franchisee's authorized personnel. 
(b)  Only University of Kansas Use. As long as franchisee uses its facilities only for its own purposes with the University of Kansas with the University of Kansas, or for transmissions between the University of Kansas and the City, no franchise fee shall be assessed. Additionally, no franchise fee shall be assessed for transmissions between any other additional public or private not-for-profit entities that have been approved to use the facilities by both franchisee and by the City.

In such negotiations, the Company shall take into account the impact on the City of any such amendment.

b.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not: 
(1)  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party; 
(2)  Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or 
(3)  Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party. 
c.  As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property). 
d.  Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573. 
e.  This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law. 
SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
a.  Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract Franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate its Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public Right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
b.  Grantee's use of the Public Right-of-Way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public Right-of-Way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public Right-of-Way. 
c.  Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program. 
d.  City shall require Grantee to repair all damage to a Public Right-of-Way caused by the activities of Grantee, or of any agent, affiliate, employee, or subcontractor of Grantee, while occupying, installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in a Public Right-of-Way and to return the Right-of-Way, to its functional equivalence before the damage pursuant to the reasonable requirements and specifications of the City. If Grantee fails to make the repairs required by the City, the City may effect those repairs and charge Grantee the cost of those repairs. If the City incurs damages as a result of a violation of this subsection, then the City shall have a cause of action against Grantee for violation of this subsection and may recover its damages, including reasonable attorney fees, if Grantee is found liable by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
All Facilities of Grantee shall be installed and maintained in accordance with all applicable federal, State and local laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the City's applicable permit application and construction requirements for attachments to City Facilities, the City's adopted building and electrical codes, and the City's Municipal Code, City regulations and Policy Statements, including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public Right-of-Way or other public property or private property, (collectively, the "Codes"). Grantee shall, at its own expense, make and maintain its Facilities in safe condition and good repair, in accordance with all Codes and Grantee shall replace, remove, reinforce or repair any defective Facilities. 
When the City reasonably believes there is an Emergency or Facilities of Grantee present an immediate threat to the safety of any person, interferes with the performance of the City's service obligations or poses an immediate threat to the physical integrity of City Facilities, the City may perform such work and/or take such action as it deems necessary without first giving written notice to Grantee. As soon as practicable thereafter, the City will advise Grantee of the work performed or the action taken. Grantee shall be responsible for all actual and reasonable costs incurred by the City in taking action pursuant to this Paragraph, and shall indemnify the City from liability for all such work except to the extent of the City's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with such liability. An "Emergency" is a condition that in the discretion of City (i) poses an immediate threat to the safety of any person or the public; (ii) materially and adversely interferes with the performance of City's service obligations; or (iii) poses an immediate threat to the integrity of City's equipment or property. 
e.  If requested by the City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, Grantee promptly shall remove its Facilities from the Public Right-of-Way or shall relocate or adjust its Facilities within the Public Right-of-Way at no cost to the City, providing such request binds all users of such Public Right-of-Way. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any written request by the City for such relocation or adjustment, providing that the City shall use its best efforts to provide Grantee with a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days advance notice to comply with any such relocation or adjustment. Any damages suffered by the City or its contractors as a result of Grantee's failure to timely relocate or adjust its Facilities shall be borne by Grantee. Grantee shall designate one (1) person within its organization by his/her employment position to whom relocation notices shall be sent and with whom rests the responsibility to facilitate all necessary communications within Grantee's various areas. 
Where a project referenced in the preceding paragraph is primarily for private benefit (provided, however, that projects that are a part of a City-created tax increment financing or transportation development district are not considered primarily for private benefit), the City shall require, as a condition of its approval of any request for alteration of the Public Right-of-Way from any private party or parties, that such private party or parties shall reimburse Grantee for the cost of relocation. Grantee understands however that the City has no obligation to collect such reimbursement. 
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY. 
In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed the maximum Access line fee allowed by Statute. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year. 
a.  Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee. 
b.  Grantee shall pay on a quarterly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the quarter for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
c.  Upon forty-five (45) days prior written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
d.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City.

The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors.

SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION. 
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council's consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court's final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. 
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. 
a.  The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE. 
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. 
a.  To the extent provided by law, the City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee, if such is the case, and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE. 
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee.

The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Company and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Company and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.

(3)  Any other material and unintended change or shift in the economic benefit to the City or the Company relied upon and anticipated upon entering into this franchise. 
(4)  The compensation provision of this franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines, and use the public rights-of-way or public property of the City without paying a franchise fee or other payment substantially equivalent to the franchise fee established herein, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Company. Likewise, the use of right of provision of this franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines which use the public rights-of-way or public property of the City, and do not have requirements on the use of the public ways substantially equivalent to the requirements of this franchise, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Company. Upon any such event, the City shall have up to ninety (90) days after written request of the Company to restore competitive neutrality. Following notice to the City, Company may suspend collection and payment of the franchise fee to the City for the affected customers until the City resolves the competitive disadvantage. After the last above referred ninety (90) day period expires without resolution of the competitive disadvantage, the Company shall have no liability to the City for any uncollected franchise fees suspended as provided in the subsection. 
c.  If any clause, sentence, section, or provision of K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, shall be held to be invalid by a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, provided such order is not stayed, either the City or Company may elect to terminate the entire franchise. In the event of such invalidity, if Company is required by law to enter into a franchise with the City, the parties agree to act in good faith in promptly negotiating a new franchise. 
d.  Amendments under this Section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. This franchise shall remain in effect according to its terms, pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
e.  In the event the parties are actively negotiating in good faith a new contract franchise ordinance or an amendment to this franchise upon the termination date of this franchise, the parties by written mutual agreement may extend the termination date of this franchise to allow for further negotiations. Such extension period shall be deemed a continuation of this franchise and not as a new franchise ordinance or amendment. 
SECTION 11. POINT OF CONTACT AND NOTICES 
Company shall at all times maintain with the City a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Company in the event of an emergency. Company shall provide the City with said local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address.

SECTION 2. GRANT OF CONTRACT FRANCHISE. 
a.  There is hereby granted to Grantee this nonexclusive Contract franchise to construct, maintain, extend and operate its Facilities along, across, upon or under any Public Right-of-Way for the purpose of supplying Wireless Services as a Wireless Infrastructure Provider within the corporate boundaries of the City, for the term of this Contract franchise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Contract franchise. 
b.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public Right-of-Way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public Right-of-Way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not: 
(1)  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, related to Wireless Services or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party; 
(2)  Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public Right-of-Way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or 
(3)  Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party. 
c.  As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") or the Kansas Corporation Commission ("KCC"). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or City regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public Right-of-Way or other public or private property). 
d.  Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573. 
e.  This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law. 
SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
a.  Pursuant to K.S.A. 66-2019, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate its Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public Right-of-Way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
b.  Grantee's use of the Public Right-of-Way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public Right-of-Way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances (hereinafter "Laws") adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way, including, but not limited to the City's ordinance for managing the use and occupancy of the Public Right-of-way, codified at [on] February 18, 2018, Code of City of Roeland Park, Kansas, and amendments thereto and the City's zoning and land-use laws to specifically include the City's Unified Development Ordinance and related rules and regulations and amendments thereto, to the extent such laws do not conflict with or are preempted by any Federal law or regulation. 
c.  Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program. 
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY. 
In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City an annual franchise fee of 5% of Gross Revenues. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate its Gross Revenues and multiply such amount by 5%. 
a.  Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies, franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
b.  Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per calendar quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a statement, executed by an authorized officer of Grantee or his or her designee, showing the amount of Gross Revenues for the period covered by the statement, and the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
c.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. 
d.  The City shall have the right to examine, upon not less than seven (7) business days written notice to Grantee, no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee. 
e.  Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of Two Thousand Dollars ($2000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Contract franchise. 
f.  The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001 and 66-2019, and amendments thereto. The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public Right-of-Way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS. 
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional misconduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including observing marker posts when working near Grantee's Facilities. 
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the degree that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence, gross negligence or wrongful act of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. 
If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee's activities in the Public right-of-way. 
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND. 
a.  During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the State of Kansas. Should Grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance: 
(1)  Workers' compensation as provided for under any worker's compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers' liability limit equal to the amount required by law. 
(2)  Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed, operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The Grantee may meet the policy limit requirements above in combination with commercial general liability policies and umbrella liability policies. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee's operations under this Contract franchise. 
b.  As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred. 
c.  Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice. Grantee shall make available to the City on request the policy declarations page and a certified copy of the policy in effect, so that limitations and exclusions can be evaluated for appropriateness of overall coverage. 
d.  Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a performance bond in the amount of $50,000, payable to the City to ensure the appropriate and timely performance in the construction and maintenance of Facilities located in the Public right-of-way. The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance. 
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION. 
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council's consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court's final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. 
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. 
a.  The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Wireless Service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair. 
b.  In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, its powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City. 
c.  In granting its consent hereunder, Grantee does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, or under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City. 
d.  In entering into this Contract franchise, neither the City's nor Grantee's present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived. By entering into the Contract franchise, neither the City nor Grantee waive any rights, but instead expressly reserve any and all rights, remedies, and arguments the City or Grantee may have at law or equity, without limitation, to argue, assert, and/or take any position as to the legality or appropriateness of any present or future laws, non-franchise ordinances and/or rulings. 
SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE. 
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee. 
SECTION 10. TERM AND TERMINATION DATE. 
a.  This Contract franchise shall be effective for a term beginning on the effective date of this Contract franchise and ending on February 18, 2028. Thereafter, this Contract franchise will automatically renew for up to fifteen (15) additional one-year (1) terms, unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its intent to terminate the Contract franchise at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional terms shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new franchise or amendment. 
b.  Upon written request of either the City or Grantee, this Contract franchise shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of state law upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the City or Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the Contract franchise granted to Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City hereunder. 
c.  Amendments under this Section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. This Contract franchise shall remain in effect according to its terms, pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
d.  In the event the parties are actively negotiating in good faith a new contract franchise ordinance or an amendment to this Contract franchise upon the termination date of this Contract franchise, the parties by written mutual agreement may extend the termination date of this Contract franchise to allow for further negotiations. Such extension period shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new contract franchise ordinance or amendment. 
SECTION 11. POINT OF CONTACT AND NOTICES 
Grantee shall at all times maintain with the City a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Grantee in the event of an emergency. Grantee shall provide the City with said local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address.

b.  The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not: 
(1)  Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party; 
(2)  Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or 
(3)  Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party. 
c.  As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property). 
d.  Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573. 
e.  This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law. 
SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
a.  Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate it Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
b.  Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way, including, but not limited to, Chapter 13, Article 2 and 8 of the City's Code and amendments thereto. 
c.  Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program. 
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY. 
a.  In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee in the sum of $1.20 per Access Line per month for each residential service Access Line served by Grantee for local exchange service within the City limits of the City and a franchise fee in the sum of $2.00 per Access Line per month for each commercial service Access Line served by Grantee for local exchange service within the City limits of the City. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to $1.20 per Access Line per month for each residential service Access Line and $2.00 per Access Line per month for commercial service Access Line, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to a Gross Receipts fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Gross Receipts fee shall not exceed 5% of Gross Receipts. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.

Beginning January 1, 2013, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee. 
c.  Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
d.  Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated. 
e.  No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. 
f.  The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee. 
g.  Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Contract franchise. 
h.  The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001 and 17-1902, and amendments thereto. The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
i.  Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance. 
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS. 
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee's Facilities. 
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence, gross negligence or wrongful act of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way. 
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee's activities in the Public right-of-way. 
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND. 
a.  During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the state of Kansas. Should Grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance: 
(1)  Workers' compensation as provided for under any worker's compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers' liability limit equal to the amount required by law. 
(2)  Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee's operations under this Contract franchise. Grantee may utilize primary and umbrella liability insurance policies to satisfy insurance policy limit requirements in this section. 
b.  As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred. 
c.  Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice. Grantee shall make available to the City on request the policy declarations page and a certified copy of the policy in effect, at a mutually agreed upon location within ten (10) miles of the City, so that limitations and exclusions can be evaluated for appropriateness of overall coverage. 
d.  Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a performance bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), payable to the City to ensure the appropriate and timely performance in the construction and maintenance of Facilities located in the Public right-of-way. The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance. 
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION. 
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council's consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent either party from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court's final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. 
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. 
a.  To the extent provided by law, the City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee, if such is the case, and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee's rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee's property in good repair. 
b.  In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, its Home Rule powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City. 
c.

d.  In entering into this Contract franchise, neither the City's nor Grantee's present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived. By entering into the Contract franchise, neither the City nor Grantee waive any rights, but instead expressly reserve any and all rights, remedies, and arguments the City or Grantee may have at law or equity, without limitation, to argue, assert, and/or take any position as to the legality or appropriateness of any present or future laws, non-franchise ordinances (e.g. the City's right-of-way ordinance referenced in Section 3b of this Contract franchise, and 47 U.S.C.A. 253), and/or rulings. 
SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE. 
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee. 
SECTION 10. TERM AND TERMINATION DATE. 
a.  This Contract franchise shall be effective for a term beginning on the effective date of this Contract franchise and ending on September, 2028. Thereafter, this Contract franchise will automatically renew for up to eight (8) additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract franchise at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new franchise or amendment. 
b.  Upon written request of either the City or Grantee, this Contract franchise shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of state law upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the City or Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the Contract franchise granted to Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City hereunder. 
c.  Amendments under this Section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. This Contract franchise shall remain in effect according to its terms, pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
d.  In the event the parties are actively negotiating in good faith a new contract franchise ordinance or an amendment to this Contract franchise upon the termination date of this Contract franchise, the parties by written mutual agreement may extend the termination date of this Contract franchise to allow for further negotiations. Such extension period shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract franchise and not as a new contract franchise ordinance or amendment.

Grantee shall at all times maintain with the City a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Grantee in the event of an emergency.
