PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Flagler Beach of a general and permanent nature. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-3 and 2-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-3.1, and 2-3.2 and 2-3.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 5 and 6, it will be designated as Chapter 5.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Erin L. McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Linda Davis and Guy Lebeda, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to City Attorney Irwin A. Connelly, City Administrator Anton Harwig and City Clerk Dorothy Moore, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(d)  The tax roll used in connection with the taxation of such property for the base year shall be the tax roll of 1995 Flagler County. All deposits into the fund shall begin with the incremental increases in ad valorem tax revenues received subsequent to November 1, 1996.

(1)  That amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by all taxing authorities, excluding the school district, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the project; and, 
(2)  That amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for all taxing authorities, excluding the school district, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable property in the project, as shown upon the 1995 assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by all taxing authorities, excluding the school district. If any conflict occurs between the provisions of this section and the provisions of F.S. Ch. 163, pt. III, concerning tax increment financing, the statutory provisions shall control and apply in this section. 
(f)  The tax increment shall be computed by using the assessed value of taxable property in the project for the year 1995 as the base, and in subsequent years using the assessment value of property in the project for that year as the second factor in determining the amount of tax increment in that year. 
(g)  All taxing authorities, excluding the school district, will annually appropriate to the fund the aforestated sum at the beginning of their fiscal year. The fund shall receive the tax increment above described only as, if and when such taxes may be collected by the taxing authorities. The taxing authorities' obligation to annually appropriate to the fund shall commence immediately upon the effective date of this section and continue until all loans, advances and indebtednesses, if any, and interest thereon, incurred by the agency as a result of the project have been paid and only to the extent that such tax increment recited above accrues. 
(h)  The agency with the approval of the city commission is directed to establish and set up the fund and to develop and promulgate rules, regulations and criteria whereby the fund may be promptly and effectively administered, including the establishment and the maintenance of books and records and adoption of procedures whereby the agency may, expeditiously and without undue delay, utilize said monies for their allocated statutory purpose. 
(i)  The agency accepts full responsibility for the receipt, custody, disbursement, accountability, management and proper application of all monies paid into the fund subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-31. - Code of ethics for public employees. 
    All employees of the city are bound by Chapter 112, Part III, "Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees," of the Florida Statutes. Each employee shall be given a copy of the Code of Ethics and shall comply with such code during employment with the city. 
(Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 10-25-12) 
Sec. 2-32. - Gift policies for employees. 
(a)  The policies and standards set forth herein regulating gifts and certain matters are founded upon the following statutory principles: 
(1)  The public interest requires that the law protect against any conflict of interest and establish standards for the conduct of government employees in situations where conflicts may exist. F.S. § 112.311(1). 
(2)  It is declared to be the policy of the state that local employees are agents of the people and hold their positions for the benefit of the public, promoting the public interest; and maintaining the respect of the people in their government must be of foremost concern. F.S. § 112.311(6). 
(3)  Florida Statutes § 112.326 allows the governing body of a local government to impose upon its employees and officers additional or more stringent standards of conduct and disclosure requirements than those specified in the code of ethics, provided that those standards of conduct and disclosure requirements do not otherwise conflict with the provisions of the code of ethics. 
(b)  The city commission, in accordance with the statutory principles set forth above, and in recognition of the principle that the public's belief and trust in its government is of overriding concern, establishes a gift policy for its employees that is more restrictive than, and not in conflict with, the policies established in F.S. ch. 112, pt. III. The city's gift policy is as follows: 
(1)  Employees shall not accept gifts, favors, rewards, promise of future employment, service, gratuities, loans, or anything else of value, offered because of employees' position with the city. This limitation is not intended to prohibit the acceptance by employees of articles of negligible value given in appreciation. However, if a gift could be perceived as being given with an understanding that a future action or judgment of the employee will be influenced thereby, the employee shall not accept the gift, favor, gratuity, or loan. 
(2)  Any gift received by an employee other than that of negligible value and which is intended as an expression of appreciation to the city shall be deemed to be the property of the city and shall be treated as public property. All such gifts shall be deemed to have been accepted in the employee's capacity as a public employee on behalf of the city. The employee shall submit the gift to the city manager or designee. However, if a gift could be perceived as being given with an understanding that a future action or judgment of the city or employee would be influenced thereby, the employee shall not accept the gift, favor, gratuity, or loan. 
(3)  This gift policy shall not prohibit employees from accepting invitations to functions which they attend as invited guests because of their employment with the city. Food and beverages served to the larger group attending such function shall be considered of negligible value regardless of their estimated cost. However, nothing in this subsection shall modify the reporting requirements of F.S. ch. 112. If an attendance at the function could be perceived as being given with an understanding that a future action or judgment of the city or employee would be influenced thereby, the employee shall not accept the invitation. 
(4)  The term "negligible value" for the purpose of this policy is defined to be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or less. 
(5)  The term "gift" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in F.S. § 112.312. Gifts do not include those benefits, expenses, gifts, and items set forth in F.S. § 112.312(12)(b). 
(c)  Nothing in this policy shall relieve the employee of the city from strict compliance with Florida Statutes and, particularly, F.S. ch. 112, pt. III. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall affect or otherwise modify the rules, statutes and principles regulating the expenditure of public money exclusively for a public purpose. 
(Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 10-25-12) 
Sec. 2-33. - Advice from and reports to city manager.

(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing.

If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this section and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate or code enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(Ord. No. 89-15, § 7, 11-30-89; Ord. No. 94-15, § 7, 11-10-94; Ord. No. 2009-13, § 2, 8-6-09)

(3)  Subpoena evidence to its hearings. 
(4)  Take testimony under oath. 
(5)  Issue orders having the force of law commanding whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance.

Sec. 2-78. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a)  The special magistrate or code enforcement board, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that a previous order of the special magistrate or code enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in the section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the code enforcement board for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4), the enforcement board shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate or code enforcement board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  A special magistrate or code enforcement board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. The special magistrate or code enforcement board may petition the circuit court for enforcement of the order in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate or code enforcement board may authorize the board or city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under article X, section 4 of the State Constitution. 
(Ord. No. 89-15, § 9, 11-30-89; Ord. No. 94-15, § 9, 11-10-94; Ord. No. 2009-13, § 2, 8-6-09) 
Sec. 2-79. - Duration of liens. 
    No lien provided by this article shall continue for a longer period than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The local governing body shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(Ord. No. 89-15, § 10, 11-30-89; Ord. No. 94-15, § 10, 11-10-94) 
Sec. 2-80. - Appeals. 
    An aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final administrative order of the special magistrate or code enforcement board to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the code enforcement board. An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the execution of the order to be appealed. Copies of such appeal shall be made available to all board members, or the special magistrate, as applicable, on a timely basis.

Sec. 2-81. - Notices.

(c)  In lieu of publication as described in subparagraph (1), such notice may be posted for at least ten (10) days in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be, in the case of municipalities, at the primary municipal government office, and in the case of counties, at the front door of the courthouse in said county. 
(d)  Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(e)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with or may follow an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand-delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-101. - Firefighters' retirement system. 
    There is hereby adopted a local law pension plan for full-time and volunteer firefighters to be known as the City of Flagler Beach Firefighters' Retirement System, as set forth below. 
Section 1.  Definitions. 
(a)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based on the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table with disabled lives set forward five (5) years and an interest rate of seven and one-half (71/2) percent. This definition may only be amended by city ordinance using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Flagler Beach, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions to the system, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter or does not receive credited service as provided below. A volunteer firefighter shall not receive credited service for any purpose, including vesting, for any plan year during which he is a member if he does not meet the minimum requirements to qualify to receive a year of credited service as set forth in the city firefighter retirement system volunteer firefighter qualifications criteria, dated November, 2014, attached hereto. If a member accumulates service both as a full-time firefighter and a volunteer, credited service shall be calculated separately for full-time and volunteer service with the sum of all years used only for vesting and benefit eligibility purposes. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment. 
    The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subsection shall be five (5) years. 
(4)  This subsection is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this subsection does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Volunteer firefighters who, on, February 12, 2009, have at least two (2) years of credited service as defined herein, shall be credited with all years of past credited service. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment.

The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(b)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(c)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the board. Three (3) affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest and shall comply with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(d)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board.

(1)  As part of the system, there has hereby been established the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the firefighters' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the finance director of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the finance director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the finance director or clearly identified as such funds of the firefighters' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the firefighters' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. Ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
a.  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; 
b.  Receipts and disbursements; 
c.  Benefit payments; 
d.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city, and 
e.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
f.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Flagler Beach City Commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be limited to: 
1.  Annuity and life insurance contracts with life insurance companies in amounts sufficient to provide, in whole or in part, the benefits to which all of the members in the fund shall be entitled under the provisions of this system and pay the initial and subsequent premium thereon. 
2.  Time or savings accounts of a national bank, a state bank insured by the bank insurance fund or a savings/building and loan association insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a state or federal chartered credit union whose share accounts are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. 
3.  Obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the government of the United States or by an agency of the government of the United States. 
4.  Bonds issued by the State of Israel. 
5.  Stocks, commingled funds, mutual funds or other investment vehicles approved by the board and bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, provided that: 
(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (ii), all individually held securities and all securities in a commingled or mutual fund or other investment vehicle approved by the board must be issued or guaranteed by a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state or organized territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia and, in the case of bonds only, shall hold a rating in one (1) of the three (3) highest classifications by a major rating service. 
(ii)  Not more than twenty-five (25) percent of the assets of the fund at market value may be invested in foreign securities. 
(iii)  The aggregate investment in any one (1) issuing company shall not exceed five (5) percent of the outstanding capital stock of that company; nor shall the aggregate of its investments in common stock, capital stock and convertible securities at market exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the assets of the fund. 
6.  Real estate, provided the board shall not invest more than ten (10) percent at market in real property or real estate. 
7.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under Section 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
(i)  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to this subsection (6)b.7. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
(ii)  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to this subsection (6)b.7. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
(iii)  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
c.  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 175.071, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this division, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
Section 5.  Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to § 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
Section 6.  Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit, which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall be the sum of: 
(1)  Three (3) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service, plus 
(2)  Forty dollars ($40.00) for each year of credited service. 
For members with both full-time and volunteer credited service, the average final compensation and credited service shall be calculated separately for full-time service and volunteer service and the separately-calculated full-time and volunteer benefits shall be added together for a total monthly benefit. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date, which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit, which shall commence at age fifty-five (55) and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit, which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (1) above, reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes age fifty-five (55). 
(e)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
Section 7.  Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (b) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit; however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10(g). 
(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained seventy and one-half (701/2). 
(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. 
The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit; however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10(g). 
(4)  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a) (9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
Section 8.  Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension calculated in the same manner as for normal retirement, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the average final compensation of the member. (Members with both full-time and volunteer credited service shall have this benefit calculated in the same manner as for normal retirement.) Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
(i) Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
(ii) At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
(iii) Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
(iv) Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(i)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(ii)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(iii)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(iv)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived there from, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension calculated in the same manner as for normal retirement, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be twenty-five (25) percent of the average final compensation of the member. (Members with both full-time and volunteer credited service shall have this benefit calculated in the same manner as for normal retirement.) Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a firefighter with the City of Flagler Beach shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this division may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in Section 10(a)(1) or 10(a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
Section 9.  Vesting. 
If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
Section 10.  Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a) (9)-6) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2)) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in Section 11. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under Section 7. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with Section 11. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of Section 6(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
Section 11.  Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
Section 12.  Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
Section 13.  Reports to division of retirement. 
Each year and no later than March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 175.261. 
Section 14.  Roster of retirees. 
The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this division in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
Section 15.  Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (51/2) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty (30) year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one (1) year stabilization period)) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by one and five-tenths (1.05). 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (2). 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Section 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 7. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a), such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Section 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 7. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten (10) years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in Sections 25 and 26, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection (j)(1). 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection, only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
Section 16.  Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 6, Section 7, Section 9, or Section 10 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 7) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a) (9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year, which contains the member's required beginning date. 
For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section 7. 
Section 17.  Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under code section 401(a) and a governmental plan under code section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(e)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by Internal Revenue Code Section 503(b). 
(f)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. Ch. 175. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 175.101. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system, which violates the requirements of F.S. Ch. 175, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
Section 18.  Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This division establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this division shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. Ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this division, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this division who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be non-forfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the firefighter. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
Section 19.  Domestic relations orders; retiree directed payments; exemption from execution, non-assignability. 
(a)  Domestic relations orders. 
(1)  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payments to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. Ch. 175, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from execution, non-assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this division and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this division are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable. 
Section 20.  Pension validity. 
The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct the pension amount of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or any person hereafter granted a pension under this division if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law been or who shall hereafter under this division be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified. Any overpayments or underpayments shall be corrected and paid or repaid in a reasonable manner determined by the board. 
Section 21.  Forfeiture of pension. 
(a)  Any member who is convicted of the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated by reason of his admitted commission, aid or abetment of the following specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this system, except for the return of his accumulated contributions as of the date of termination.

(b)  Conviction shall be defined as an adjudication of guilt by a court of competent jurisdiction; a plea of guilty or a nolo contendere; a jury verdict of guilty when adjudication of guilt is withheld and the accused is placed on probation; or a conviction by the senate of an impeachable offense. 
(c)  Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, which is exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a specified offense. Prior to forfeiture, the board shall hold a hearing on which notice shall be given to the member whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture. Said member shall be afforded the right to have an attorney present. No formal rules of evidence shall apply, but the member shall be afforded a full opportunity to present his case against forfeiture. 
(d)  Any member who has received benefits from the system in excess of his accumulated contributions after member's rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the fund the amount of the benefits received in excess of his accumulated contributions. The board may implement all legal action necessary to recover such funds. 
Section 22.  Conviction and forfeiture; false, misleading or fraudulent statements. 
(a)  It is unlawful for a person to willfully and knowingly make, or cause to be made, or to assist, conspire with, or urge another to make, or cause to be made, any false, fraudulent, or misleading oral or written statement or withhold or conceal material information to obtain any benefit from the system.

(c)  In addition to any applicable criminal penalty, upon conviction for a violation described in subsection (a), a member or beneficiary of the system may, in the discretion of the board, be required to forfeit the right to receive any or all benefits to which the person would otherwise be entitled under the system. For purposes of this subsection, "conviction" means a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. 
Section 23.  Indemnification. 
(a)  To the extent not covered by insurance contracts in force from time to time, the city shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless members of the board from all personal liability for damages and costs, including court costs and attorneys' fees, arising out of claims, suits, litigation, or threat of same, herein referred to as "claims", against these individuals because of acts or circumstances connected with or arising out of their official duty as members of the board. The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to settle or not settle the claim at any time, and to appeal or to not appeal from any adverse judgment or ruling, and in either event will indemnify, defend and hold harmless any members of the board from the judgment, execution, or levy thereon. 
(b)  This division shall not be construed so as to relieve any insurance company or other entity liable to defend the claim or liable for payment of the judgment or claim, from any liability, nor does this division waive any provision of law affording the city immunity from any suit in whole or part, or waive any other substantive or procedural rights the city may have. 
(c)  This division shall not apply nor shall the city be responsible in any manner to defend or pay for claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of the board, which constitute felonies or gross malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office. 
Section 24.  Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system, to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
Section 25.  Prior fire service. 
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in Section 1, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a firefighter with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a firefighter for any other municipal, county or special district fire department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of this system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section shall be five (5) years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the City of Flagler Beach and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal or special district fire department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in Section 15(1)(2). 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a firefighter as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a firefighter in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the Division of State Fire Marshal, as provided under F.S. Ch. 633, or the firefighter provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a firefighter under Sec. 1., Definitions. 
Section 26.  Military service prior to employment. 
The years or fractional parts of years that a firefighter serves or has served on active duty in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily and honorably or under honorable conditions, prior to first and initial employment with the city fire department shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section shall be five (5) years. 
(5)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
Section 27.  Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
Section 28.  Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; F.S. Ch. 175 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. Ch. 175, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 175.351. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan") shall be further allocated to the members as follows: 
(a)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual member share accounts and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member hereunder. Each member shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. Ch. 175 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain a separate membership share account for each member, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(b)  Share account funding. 
(1)  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all members who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (c) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2015. 
(2)  In addition, any forfeitures as provided in subsection (d), shall be allocated to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (d). 
(c)  Allocation of monies to share accounts. 
(1)  Allocation of F.S. Ch. 175 contributions. 
a.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014 and prior to September 30, 2015 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual Member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
b.  On each valuation date, each current member of the plan and each retiree who retires in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member(not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
c.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of credited service of the deceased member. 
d.  Re-employed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
(2)  Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
(3)  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
(4)  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the F.S. Ch. 175 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
(5)  [ Annual statements. ] Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(d)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (e) shall forfeit his individual member share account or the non-vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual member accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection (c)(1). 
(e)  Eligibility for benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary)who terminates employment as a firefighter with the city or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Retirement benefit. 
a.  A member shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to Section 6. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(2)  Termination benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member's employment as a firefighter is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with Section 9. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(3)  Disability benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8(a) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8(c), he shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(4)  Death benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member dies while actively employed as a firefighter, one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account shall be paid to his designated beneficiary as provided in Section 7. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(f)  Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (c), following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one (1) lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(g)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this Section 28 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(h)  Notional account. The share account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from employment. The member has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(i)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(j)  Maximum additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, annual additions under this section shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415(c) of the code pursuant to the provisions of Section 15(k).

Sec. 2-102. - Police Officers' Retirement System. 
    There is hereby adopted a local law pension plan for police officers to be known as the City of Flagler Beach Police Officers' Retirement System, as set forth in the document attached hereto and made a part hereof. [herein:] 
CITY OF FLAGLER BEACH POLICE OFFICERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM 
Section 1.  Definitions. 
(a)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table with disabled lives set forward five (5) years and an interest rate of seven and six-tenths (7 6/10 ) percent per annum. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Flagler Beach, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment. 
    The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subsection shall be five (5) years. 
(4)  This subsection is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this subsection does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means the date on which the ordinance from which this section is derived becomes effective. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the state. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer reportable on the member's W-2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered, or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. For service earned after September 12, 2013 (the "effective date"), salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year and shall also not include payments for accrued unused sick or annual leave. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year or accrued unused sick or annual leave accrued as of the effective date and attributable to service earned prior to the effective date, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after the effective date. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to the effective date, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on the effective date or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on the effective date. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the city police officers' retirement system as contained herein and all amendments thereto. 
(b)  Masculine gender. The masculine gender, where used herein, unless the context specifically requires otherwise, shall include both the feminine and masculine genders. 
Section 2.  Membership. 
(a)  Conditions of eligibility. All police officers as of the effective date, and all future new police officers, shall become members of this system as a condition of employment.

(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(12)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(13)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
Section 5.  Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of ten (10) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, but in no event shall the city's annual contribution be less than six and one-half (61/2) percent of the total salary of members. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
Section 6.  Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service, or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three and nineteen one-hundredths (3 19/100 ) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1), reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service. 
(e)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
Section 7.  Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (b) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10, subsection (g). 
(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsections (b)(1) or (2), elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained seventy and one-half (701/2). 
(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (b)(1) or (2), but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10, subsection (g). 
(4)  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (c)(1) or (2), elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (c)(1) or (2), but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
Section 8.  Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and nineteen one-hundredths (3 19/100 ) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (b)(2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection (b)(2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection (b)(2)e.1. does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and nineteen one-hundredths (3 19/100 ) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this section may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event a member is involuntarily terminated by the city for medical reasons, the monthly retirement benefits shall be payable retroactively to the later of one (1) month after the date of the application for disability benefits or the date that the city involuntarily terminates the member's employment for medical reasons. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in Section 10(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
Section 9.  Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(a)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(b)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
Section 10.  Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. 
Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2)) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in Section 11. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under Section 7. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with Section 11. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of Section 6, subsection (a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
Section 11.  Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
Section 12.  Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
Section 13.  Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
Section 14.  Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this section in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
Section 15.  Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (51/2) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty (30) year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one (1) year stabilization period)) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (2). 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1)); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Section 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 7. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Section 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 7. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten (10) years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in Sections 26 and 27, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
Section 16.  Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 6, Section 7, Section 9, or Section 10 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 7) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section 7. 
Section 17.  Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(e)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by Code Section 503(b). 
(f)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § [ch. 185] determined based upon his actual years of credited service. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system which violates the requirements of F.S. ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
Section 18.  Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This section establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this section shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this section, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this section who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (c)((2), the amounts determined under subsection (c)(3). 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the state department of management services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
Section 19.  Domestic relations orders; retiree directed payments; exemption from execution, non-assignability. 
(a)  Domestic relations orders.

Section 24.  Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
Section 25.  Family and Medical Leave Act. 
    The fractional parts of the twelve-month period ending each March 1 that a member is on leave without pay from the city pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be added to his credited service provided that:

(2)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time for the twelve-month period prior to each March 1 and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made on or before April 30 for the preceding twelve-month period ending March 1 and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be issued.

(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section shall be five (5) years. 
(5)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
Section 27.  Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in Section 1, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time police officer for any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department in the state shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the police officer of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the city shall be five (5) years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the city and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in Section 15, subsection (l)(2). 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a police officer as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a police officer in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the criminal justice standards and training commission within the department of law enforcement, as provided under F.S. ch. 943, or the police officer provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a police officer under Section 1. 
Section 28.  Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue receipt of benefits during any subsequent employment period. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
Section 29.  Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; F.S. Ch 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. Ch. 185, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("share plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members as follows: 
(a)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual member share accounts and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member hereunder. Each member shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. Ch. 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain a separate membership share account for each member, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(b)  Share account funding. 
(1)  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all members who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in subsection (c) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2015. 
(2)  In addition, any forfeitures as provided in subsection (d), shall be allocated to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (d). 
(c)  Allocation of monies to share accounts. 
(1)  Allocation of F.S. Ch. 185 contributions. 
a.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014 and prior to September 30, 2015 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
b.  On each valuation date, each current member of the plan and each retiree who retires in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member(not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
1.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be divided equally among those persons eligible for an allocation and allocated to the share account of those eligible for an allocation. 
2.  Re-employed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
(2)  Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
(3)  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
(4)  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the F.S. Ch. 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
(5)  [ Annual statements. ] Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(d)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (e) shall forfeit his individual member share account or the non-vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual member accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection (c)(1). 
(e)  Eligibility for benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary) who terminates employment as a police officer with the city or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Retirement benefit. 
a.  A member shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to Section 6. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(2)  Termination benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member's employment as a police officer is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with Section 9. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(3)  Disability benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8(a) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8(c), he shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(4)  Death benefit. 
a.  In the event that a member dies while actively employed as a police officer, one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account shall be paid to his designated beneficiary as provided in Section 7. 
b.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (f). 
(f)  Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (c), following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one (1) lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(g)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this Section 29 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(h)  Notional account. The share account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from employment. The member has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(i)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(j)  Maximum additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, annual additions under this section shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415(c) of the Code pursuant to the provisions of Section 15(k). 
(k)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-290. - Policies and procedures. 
    The goal of this manual is to promote efficient and economical purchasing of commodities, goods and services for the city. The attainment of this goal is an essential element in establishing credibility and accountability for every employee of the city. However, these policies are not to be construed as placing any restriction or limitation on purchases made by direct action of the city commission in accordance with the Florida State Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, §§ 1, 2, 5-14-92) 
Sec. 2-291. - Purpose. 
    [The purpose of this article is as follows:] 
(1)  To purchase in the open market, obtaining the maximum value for the money. 
(2)  Eliminate unauthorized purchases and assist in budgetary control.

(4)  Avoid any unethical business practices or any appearance thereof.

DIVISION 2. - RULES AND OPERATION OF PURCHASING 

Sec. 2-300. - Buying practices. 
    Value is measured by more than price alone. Quality and service, as well as price, must be considered in determining the value of goods purchased. Good buying demands something more than a comparison and scrutiny of prices. 
    Each purchase should be with the idea of attaining the best possible value for the city. Each department head needs to study the prices quoted, the quality of the material offered, the use for which it is intended, the service available, and the service required of the vendor. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, §§ 1, 2, 5-14-92) 
Sec. 2-301. - Purchasing process. 
    No employee shall purchase any materials, products or services on behalf of the city unless the purchasing process has been completed as outlined in the following subsections. All employees may sign for purchases provided there is an approved purchase order, blanket purchase order, check request or credit card use form on file with the city. 
(1)  Purchasing authority. 
a.  $.01 to $500.00. Purchases of materials, products or services in this category will be authorized by department heads, the city manager or his/her designee. 
b.  $500.01 to $4,999.99. Purchases of materials, products or services in this category will be authorized by the city manager or his/her designee. At least two (2) and preferably three (3) verbal price quotes will be used for purchases in this category, unless the purchase is made from a sole source vendor or recognized governmental unit as outlined in subsection 2-302(d) and (e). These price quotes must be attached to the purchase order requisition, check request or credit card use form including any appropriate comments if the lowest price is not utilized. 
c.  $5,000.00 to $19,999.99. Purchases of materials, products or services in this category will be authorized only by the city manager. At least two (2) and preferably three (3) written price quotes will be required for purchases in this category, unless the purchase is made from a sole source vendor or recognized governmental unit as outlined in subsection 2-302(d) and (e). The written quotes must be attached to the purchase order requisition, check request, or credit card use form including any appropriate comments if the lowest price is not utilized. 
d.  $20,000.00 and above. Sealed bids will be utilized for any items over twenty thousand dollars. The splitting of invoices for the purpose of avoiding the bidding requirements is expressly prohibited. Purchases of materials, products or services in this category will be authorized only by the city commission. 
(2)  Method of purchasing. It shall be the responsibility of the those individuals granted the purchasing authority as stated in the prior section to ensure sufficient funds are available in the account prior to the approval of a purchase order requisition, check request, or credit card use form. The finance department will not process a purchase order, blanket purchase order, issue the credit card or a check if sufficient funds are not available. Purchases may be made using one (1) of the three (3) methods: 
a.  Purchase orders system. The purchase order system allows for the single purchase from a vendor of a specific item; a list of items as identified on the requisition or the continued purchase from a vendor for a specific dollar amount for one (1) fiscal year. Purchase order requisitions forms will be utilized to make the request for a purchase order or a blanket purchase order. 
1.  Purchase orders. Employee identifies the materials, products or services that are needed, completes the purchase order requisition, obtains the appropriate approval and submits the form to the finance department for issuance of a purchase order. Once the purchase order is received the materials, products or services may be ordered or purchased. 
2.  Blanket purchase orders. Blanket purchase orders will be used for multiple purchases from the same vendor within one (1) fiscal year. Some examples are: newspaper advertisements; parts; supplies; vehicle repairs and maintenance. Blanket purchase orders may be used for regular purchases, but may not exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00), unless approved by the city commission. 
b.  Credit card use forms. Since many vendors do not accept purchase orders, credit cards afford employees the ability to purchase necessary items in a timely fashion. Only the city manager may authorize an application for a new credit card. Credit cards may be used for a single purchase from a vendor of a specific item; a list of items as identified on the credit card use form or the continued purchase from a vendor for a specific dollar amount for one (1) fiscal year. Credit card use forms will be utilized to make the request to use any credit card. Credit cards for stores such as Lowes, Home Depot and Staples will only be used when an approved credit card use form is on file with the city. 
c.  Check request form. There are times when a vendor may not accept a city credit card. In these cases a check request form will be completed, the appropriate authorization obtained and forwarded to the finance department. When the check is ready, it will be forwarded to the vendor or returned to the employee as outlined on the check request form. 
(3)  Processing of invoices or receipts for payment. 
a.  Invoices or receipts for purchases made using a purchase order, single or blanket, will be signed by the department head, the purchase order number will be written on the invoice or receipt and it will be forwarded to the finance department for payment. The finance department will refuse payment for any purchase which a signed invoice or receipt is not received. 
b.  Invoices or receipts for purchases made using a credit card will be attached to the approved credit card use form and forwarded to the finance department. The finance department will match the credit card use forms, with the attached invoices or receipts, to the credit card statement prior to payment of the monthly bill. Any discrepancies must be brought to the attention of the city manager, who will promptly investigate the discrepancy. 
c.  Payment of monthly reoccurring services, such as, but not limited to, utility bills, cellular phone bills, telephone bills, gasoline or diesel purchases, uniform rental bills and approved leases will be made by the finance department and the expense allocated to the appropriate department fund, without the need for signature of the department head, city manager or his designee, provided sufficient funds are available. Should additional funds be needed a budget transfer or amendment will be processed prior to payment. 
    The above rules of operation may be waived in case of emergency by authority of the mayor, chairman of the commission, or city manager. An emergency, for this section, will be defined as any condition where there is a threat to the public health, safety, welfare, or property of the citizens of the Flagler Beach. The department head must notify one of the above persons of the existence of an emergency situation as soon as he/she is aware a problem exists. This clause in no way alters the provisions under chapter 14, article III, Emergency Management of the City Code of Ordinances. This clause is designed to compliment article III. 
    The person authorizing the waiving of these purchasing policies must notify the city commission of this decision within twenty-four (24) hours or within twenty-four (24) hours of the conclusion of the emergency situation. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, §§ 1, 2, 5-14-92; Ord. No. 93-5, §§ 1-3, 6-24-93; Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 12-19-96; Ord. No. 2008-04, § 3, 4-24-08) 
Sec. 2-302. - Objectives. 
(a)  Bulk purchases will be explored and utilized whenever possible. 
(b)  To streamline the purchasing of materials, products or services that are needed, employees will collect the pricing data necessary to complete the purchase order requisition, check request or credit card use form; obtain the appropriate approval; make the purchase, and turn the receipt in for payment by the finance department. 
(c)  All bids shall be developed using a standardized bid format and language unless an exception is made by the city manager. 
(d)  Sole source vendors. Subject to the approval of the city commission and/or the city manager. 
(1)  A vendor may be declared a sole source if the department head provides written documentation to the city manager stating that this is the only vendor which can fill the needs of his department. A sole source vendor for purchases over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) can only be approved by the city commission. 
(2)  A vendor may be declared a sole source by a department head through written documentation to the city manager stating that this vendor's product, service or price exceeds that of the competition. If the evaluation is based on price, it must be limited to items which are purchased regularly. In addition, the department head must provide a price quote sheet documenting the cost of competing vendors. 
The approval by the city manager of a vendor as an evaluated sole source is limited to a time period not to exceed six (6) months. Should the quality of material, service, or price change during the six-month period the sole source classification for that vendor will be immediately lifted. 
(e)  Purchases may be made from the State of Florida contract, federal general services administration contracts, university contracts, or other recognized governmental units without competitive bidding. Permission for purchases over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) must be approved by the city commission.

Sec. 2-303. - Capital purchases. 
    The city shall at all times comply with the state guidelines in regard to capital purchases as it relates to maintaining a record of tangible property. For the purposes of making an accounting classification of a capital asset, the city shall define a capital asset as an item or infrastructure asset having an original cost of at least five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and a useful life of at least one (1) year. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, §§ 1, 2, 5-14-92; Ord. No. 2002-08, § 1, 4-25-02) 
Sec. 2-304. - Petty cash procedures. 
    No single item expenditure from any petty cash fund shall exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), unless specifically authorized by the city manager or his/her designee. The petty cash fund shall not be used to purchase equipment or for the payment of salaries. 
    Expenditures from the petty cash fund must be supported by the following information: 
(1)  Itemized and signed vouchers; 
(2)  Purchase must have a legitimate public purpose; 
(3)  Be budgeted within the annual budget of the department. 
    A full accounting of all petty cash funds shall be made to the finance director prior to replenishing the fund and at any other time by the request of the city manager.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, public safety risks, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit sexual activity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, undesirable and criminal behavior associated with alcohol consumption, negative impacts on surrounding properties, litter, money laundering, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Each of the negative secondary effects identified above constitute a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating in the future. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is hereby deemed the city's rationale for adopting this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. In addition, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to future secondary effects that could occur in the city related to existing sexually oriented businesses as well as sexually oriented businesses that may locate within the city in the future. The city hereby finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied upon by the city commission in adopting this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
(c)  Future applicability for amendments and other regulations pertaining to sexually oriented businesses. The purpose, evidence of adverse secondary effects, and findings contained in this section shall constitute the historical legislative record of the city commission. Therefore, this legislative record shall be deemed to automatically apply, and shall hereby be re-adopted by the city commission, when any amendment to this article is adopted by the city commission or when any other ordinance is adopted by the city commission which is intended to regulate sexually oriented businesses, unless the city commission otherwise provides in the amendment or other ordinance or expressly repeals or superscedes this legislative record. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, nothing herein shall prohibit the city commission from supplementing or modifying this legislative record in the future.

Sec. 5-11. - Cruelty to animals. 
    Acts deemed as cruelty to animals as listed in F.S. §§ 828.12, 828.13 and 828.16, shall be punishable in this chapter. 
(1)  Chaining or tethering of dogs. In situations where the owner has no choice but to restrain the animal on a chain or tether, the following conditions must be met: 
• Any tethering system employed shall not allow the dog or puppy to leave the owner's property. 
• Any chain or tether must be attached to a properly fitted, properly maintained collar or harness; choke chains and ropes should not be used as a part of a tethering system. 
• If a dog or pup is to be tethered it must tethered to a stationary object; not an object that could become mobile, such as a car or truck. 
• If an animal is tethered within a fence, it must be chained or tethered far enough away from that fence as to avoid jumping and hanging. 
• A tie-out must employ a restraint that is at least ten (10) feet in length or four (4) times the length of the animal from nose to the base of the tail whichever is longer. This restraint must be longer if attached to anything that is off the ground which would lessen the moveable area for the animal. 
• A dog or puppy attached to a fixed point chain or tether which is less than twelve (12) feet in length must be released from that tether for exercise for a minimum of two (2) hours every twenty-four-hour period. (Said exercise could be inside the home for interaction with family or within a fenced enclosure or under the caretakers' supervision on a leash obeying local leash laws.) 
• A tie-out consisting of chain, leash or wire cable must be of reasonable weight so as not to injure the animal's neck, and must be secured in such a way that the tether cannot become entangled with other objects. 
• Because chained dogs are forced to eat, sleep, urinate and defecate in a single, confined area, that area must be cleaned daily. It is advised that the area that [in which] a chained dog is kept be changed regularly. Even if properly scooped, the organic materials on the ground cannot be disinfected and could pose a health risk to the animal confined to such area. Also, grass is often worn down by a dogs pacing, thus leaving nothing but dirt or mud. 
• Any female dogs or cats in heat must be kept in a secured area that prevents male dogs or cats from having access to such female except for controlled breeding permitted by the owner of the female. Additionally, the female dog or cat shall not be chained or tethered in a manner that prevents her from defending herself or from avoiding a male. 
(2)  Outdoor shelters: 
• Any dog or pup that is left unattended outdoors must be provided with proper shelter that is suitable for the size, condition and breed of each animal. 
• Shelters must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury. They shall have no sharp edges or points. 
• Shelters with wire floors must be of a small enough mesh as to not allow the animal's feet to fall through the openings. A solid or soft area must be provided as a sleeping area. 
• Metal barrels, vehicles and the like shall not constitute proper shelter. 
• Shelters must protect the animal against inclement weather, preserve body heat and allow them to remain dry. Additional bedding material must be provided when temperatures are below fifty (50) degrees. 
• Animals shall not be housed outdoors when temperatures fall below freezing. 
• A shelter with ventilation shall be provided during the warm months, or in addition to the shelter structure, one (1) or more separate areas of shade shall be provided to allow the dogs to protect themselves when sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort. 
• Floors and walls of outdoor housing facilities must be constructed in such a manner so that they are impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized. These shelters must be cleaned periodically with the regular removal of food, waste and debris. 
(3)  Health care: 
• All animals should be kept free from external parasites i.e. fleas and ticks. This may be accomplished by keeping the animal clean with regular brushing. This also may be accomplished with many of the over the counter or prescription products which may be administered as labeled, some as infrequently as every six (6) months. 
• Animals should be kept free of internal parasites, i.e. hookworm, roundworm, tapeworm, etc. This can often be accomplished by over the counter medications, but it is advisable to seek veterinary attention, as many of the over the counter products are limited in their effectiveness. 
• Animals should be examined annually by a licensed veterinarian. 
• Animals must be kept up to date on vaccines; this includes but is not limited to distemper 5 in 1 shots and rabies vaccines. 
• Dogs should be kept on heartworm prevention as advised by veterinarian. It is also advisable that cats be kept on heartworm prevention, especially outdoor cats. 
• If a dog tests positive for heartworm, provisions should be made to treat the heartworm. If treatment is not possible due to financial reasons there are other options which may be explored to keep the animal as healthy and comfortable as possible. 
• Animals who appear weak or unhealthy should receive veterinary attention. 
• Injured animals must receive immediate attention. It is required that any severe injuries be treated by a veterinarian. 
• If an owner is financially unable to provide proper health care, that owner must seek assistance or consider relinquishing the animal for its own safety.

(3)  Endangers or injures personal or real property. 
    For purposes of this definition, any sound that exceeds the maximum permissible sound levels set forth in section 13-26 of this article shall constitute a noise disturbance per se. It is the intent and purpose of this definition that sounds that either meet the aforesaid criteria or exceed the sound levels in section 13-26 shall constitute a violation of this article. 
    Sound level means the weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a metering characteristic and weighting A, B, or C as specified in American National Standards Institute specifications for sound level meters, ANSI S1.4-1983, or in successor publications. If the weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall apply. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument, which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS detector, integrator or time averager, output meter, and weighing networks used to measure sound pressure levels. The output meter reads sound pressure levels when properly calibrated, and the instrument is to type 2 or better, as specified in the American National Standards Institute Publications, S1.4-1983, or its successor publications. 
    Sound pressure level means twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the RMS sound pressure level to the reference of twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter. 
    Testing protocol shall be at least a fifteen (15) second reading from four (4) representative samples when measured at or within the receiving property, minus the ambient noise when the ambient noise is less than ten (10) dBA as determined and allowed by section 13-28 of this article. If any one (1) of the four (4) samples exceed the maximum sound level limits established in table 1, said sample shall be a violation of this article.

Sec. 13-26. - Maximum permissible sound levels by use occupancy category. 
    No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit the operation of any source of sound in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound level limits listed in table 1 when measured beyond the originating property's property line. Sound or noise projecting from one zoning district into another zoning district with a different decibel level limit shall not exceed the limits of the zoning district into which the noise is projected when measured from within such receiving zoning district. Sound pressure levels in excess of those established in table 1 shall constitute prima facie evidence that such sound is in violation of this article. The sound shall be measured using the "A" and "C" scale in slow time constant. 
(Ord. No. 2007-13, § 1(Exh. A), 5-24-07; Ord. No. 2013-02, § 1, 3-14-13)

Sec. 13-28. - Ambient noise. 
    An alleged excess noise-producing source consists of a combination of the alleged excess noise producing source level and the naturally occurring (ambient) noise level that normally exists at the measuring point. Before it can be determined if an alleged excessive noise level exceeds the maximum allowable noise levels established in this article, the naturally occurring (ambient) noise level shall be determined and said noise level shall be subtracted from the total noise level measured when the alleged excessive noise is being produced. The procedure for doing this is detailed in the table for calculating ambient noise below. 

(Ord. No. 2007-13, § 1(Exh. A), 5-24-07) 
Sec. 13-29. - Other noise.

(b)  With the exception of those exemptions provided by state law, noises prohibited by this section are unlawful, notwithstanding the fact that no violation of section 13-26 is involved, and notwithstanding the fact that the activity complained about is exempted in section 13-27. 
(c)  Thus, the following acts are declared to be loud, disturbing and unnecessary noises in violation of this article: 
(1)  The sounding of any horn or signaling device on any automobile or other vehicle, except as a danger warning; 
(2)  the creation by means of any signaling device of any unreasonably loud or harsh sound; 
(3)  the sounding of any signaling device for any unnecessary or unreasonable period of time; and the unreasonable use of any signaling device. 
(4)  the making of any sound on days other than December 31, January 1 and July 4 that is plainly audible from a distance of two hundred (200) feet from the property line of the originating property that because of its tone, duration or volume would annoy or disturb a reasonable person of normal sensitivities. 
(5)  The making of any sound except a danger warning, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on days other than December 31, January 1 and July 4 when such sound is plainly audible from within an occupied and structurally enclosed building located on property not the source of the sound. Any person making a complaint pursuant to this paragraph shall be required to sign a sworn affidavit prior to a citation being issued; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit city personnel from issuing a citation for a violation found to exist based on any other criteria contained in this article.

When an emergency has been declared, and where time and circumstances permit, the powers of the city commission, including the mayor, and the powers of the various city officials, including the city manager, shall be exercised in the same manner as provided under the Charter and ordinances and laws of the city. Otherwise, where an emergency has been duly declared, and where circumstances prevent at least four (4) commissioners from meeting, then a majority of the commissioners (including the mayor) able to meet may act by resolution and the mayor, if present, shall have a vote in any action but shall not have veto authority. In the event of a tie vote, however, in which the mayor is participating, the mayor's vote shall be given additional weight in order to break any tie during a state of emergency. Further, in any event, a declaration of a state of emergency may be rescinded at any time upon a vote of a majority of a quorum of the commission, subject to veto power of the mayor.

(5)  Prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuations; 
(6)  Control ingress and egress to and from disaster areas, the movement of persons within the area, and the occupancy of premises therein;

Sec. 14-46. - Clearing of debris from private street, roads and roadways, and other private property after a disaster. 
(a)  The city shall remove debris from private roadways when such debris is determined to be public nuisance that poses an immediate threat and imperils the health, safety and welfare of the community. The Flagler Beach City Commission shall determine whether there is a sufficient immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare in accordance with any one (1) of the following standards: 
(1)  Whether there is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent city removal. 
(2)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause illness, sickness or disease which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain. 
(3)  The removal and clearing of debris is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of power, water, sewer, telephone, and other utilities. 
(4)  The debris is determined by the fire chief to be dangerous or hazardous. 
(5)  The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard. 
(6)  The debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or ground water of the city. 
(7)  The debris has a substantially negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property. 
(8)  The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding waters of the city and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal. 
(9)  The debris poses a significant likelihood that, if left over time, would produce mold which would be injurious to public health. 
(10)  The presence of the debris significantly adversely impacts the city's recovery efforts. 
(11)  The debris significantly interferes with drainage of water runoff so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall. 
(12)  The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the city. 
(13)  The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed prior to another significant storm event. 
(14)  Commercial or other specific areas will be cleared if, in the opinion of the Flagler Beach City Commission, the clearance will significantly and substantially aid the city's recovery operations or significantly and substantially aid the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the city. 
(b)  The above criteria for city action may be waived owing to the severity of the situation by [the] Florida Long Term Recovery Office Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(c)  When the city performs the removal of debris as contemplated herein on private roads and private property, or clears private property as provided herein, when reasonably possible the city manager or his designee shall contact the private property owner and have the property owner agree to indemnify and hold the city harmless to the maximum extent provided by law, and hold harmless the federal, state and local government and all, contractors, employees, officers and agents of the city, connected with the rendering of such service. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude a first response by the city to clear debris from all roadways (both public and private) as necessary for the movement of emergency vehicles including police, fire and ambulance within the first seventy (70) hours after a disaster declaration. 
(e)  Nothing herein shall require the city to remove debris from private [property] other than private streets, roads and roadways as defined above except where the severity of the situation is of such magnitude or the debris is so widespread that it is determined by the Flagler Beach City Commission, after consulting with FEMA, to be a significant and immediate serious threat to the health, safety and welfare of the city and in the overriding public interest of the city to remove debris from such area.

Sec. 14-47. - Violation unlawful.

ARTICLE IV. - SEXUAL OFFENDERS 

Sec. 14-76. - Legislative findings and intent. 
(a)  The findings set forth in the recitals (whereas clauses) to Ordinance No. 2005-21 are hereby adopted as additional legislative findings. 
(b)  The City Commission of the City of Flagler Beach hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 775.21(3)(a) which state as follows: 
"Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant." 
(c)  The City Commission of the City of Flagler Beach hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(7) which provides, in pertinent part, that: 
"It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision. Therefore, the Department of Corrections is to provide intensive supervision by experienced correctional probation officers to conditional release offenders." 
(d)  The City Commission of the City of Flagler Beach hereby finds and determines that repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the costs of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant and a drain on the resources of society. 
(e)  It is the intent of this article [Ordinance No. 2005-21] to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety, morals and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences. 
(f)  It is the desire of the City Commission of the City of Flagler Beach that the Flagler County School District carefully adhere to the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(7), which relates to the requirement that school bus stops be located at least one thousand feet (1,000) of the persons who are the subject of this article.

(b)  For the purposes of determining the minimum distance separation requirement, distance shall be measured by following a straight line from the nearest outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer property line of the school, day care center, public park, playground (such as miniparks and recreational open spaces), library or religious institution. 
(c)  A person residing within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of any school, day care center, public park, playground (such as miniparks and recreational open spaces), library or religious institution does not commit a violation of this article if any of the following apply: 
(1)  The person established the permanent residence or temporary residence and reported and registered the residence pursuant to F.S. § 775.21, 943.0435 or 944.607 prior to August 1, 2005.

    It is prohibited and unlawful to let or rent any place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, with the knowledge that it will be used as a permanent residence or temporary residence by any person prohibited from establishing such permanent residence or temporary residence if such place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, is located within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of any school, day care center, public park, playground, recreational open spaces, library or religious institution regardless of whether the school, day care center, public park, playground, recreational open spaces, library or religious institution lies within the city limits of the City of Flagler Beach or within unincorporated Flagler County.

The intent of the city commission in adopting this article is to prohibit broadly the possession or use of simulated gambling devices, including any related activity or behavior which can be reasonably construed to be the use of simulated gambling devices. Further, the commission in prohibiting simulated gambling devices in no way intends to approve the use of actual slot machines, other forms of casino gambling, or other types of gambling devices. In addition, this prohibition is aimed directly at devices that simulate gambling activity, regardless of whether the devices or the simulations in and of themselves can be said to constitute gambling as that term may be defined elsewhere.

(c)  The Florida Legislature has identified concerns regarding the increased use and abuse of substances controlled by federal and/or state law and the frequency of injury and death occurring as a result of the increased availability of controlled substances via medical practitioners operating in pain management clinics or facilities; and 
(d)  Florida Statutes require physicians and other persons dispensing prescription drugs through pain management clinics, facilities or offices, to register with the State Department of Health in order to conduct such business; and 
(e)  The negative secondary impacts associated with the certain pain management clinics include the congregation of drug users and drug addicted persons outside of pain management clinics in a manner that has a negative effect on the willingness of residents to patronize nearby businesses and which disturbs nearby residents all hours of the day but particularly in the early morning and late evening hours thus creating an urgent situation necessitating immediate investigation into and potential regulation of such clinics in Flagler Beach; and 
(f)  It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the legal prescription, dispensation, or use of controlled substances; and 
(g)  Under its home rule authority Flagler Beach can pass additional legislation to further regulate pain management clinics as long as these additional regulations are not preempted in the law and are not inconsistent with the statutory provisions.

Each such seller must provide the city, upon sixty (60) days' written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this sixty-day period must be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the sixty-day notice requirement.

(3)  Evidence of insurance coverage and surety bond required under this article. 
(4)  Acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
(5)  A copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any; 
(6)  For an applicant that does not have a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the state, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(d)  The city manager or designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant for registration. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c), the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c), the city shall notify the applicant of the noneffectiveness of registration, and reasons for the noneffectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Noneffectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of noneffectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 20-8. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met.

(5)  Wireless facilities may increase the height of a metal street light pole only if the antenna is top-mounted and not wider than the pole or if the antenna is hidden in a cylinder that appears like an original part of the pole. A cellular antenna shall not extend more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the wireless facility is to be collocated, and shall be shorter if the height of the utility pole requires a shorter antenna height so that the structure as a whole is proportionate. 
(6)  A new utility pole that replaces an existing utility pole shall be of substantially similar design, material, and color as the existing utility pole unless the existing pole is made of wood, which is no longer permitted. 
(7)  The antennas and related equipment shall be in a color that will provide the most camouflage, as determined by the building official. Ground based wireless facilities shall be painted forest green, unless determined otherwise by the building official. When on a black pole, wireless facilities shall be painted black, unless determined otherwise by the building official. 
(8)  Antennas must be hidden within the utility pole or appear like an original part of the utility pole. 
(9)  All wireless facilities and related equipment, other than antennas, shall be placed underground in order, without limitation, to avoid impeding pedestrian travel, to avoid providing a target for graffiti or a mounting place for unauthorized signs, to minimize danger to the public, and to preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the city. 
(10)  Wires serving the wireless facilities must be concealed within or flush mounted to the pole on which the facilities are collocated and insulated in accordance with applicable codes. 
(11)  The city commission is authorized to identify by resolution forms of acceptable wireless facilities that are consistent and compatible with the aesthetic, safety, and other standards set forth in this article as well as prohibited wireless facilities. 
(12)  Antennas placed upon structures within the rights-of-way must meet the following additional requirements if stealth design, concealment, and this article's requirements regarding such cannot be met: 
a.  Top mounted antennas and their enclosures must not extend the diameter of the supporting structure at the level of antenna attachment; and 
b.  Side-mounted antennas and their enclosures must be flush-mounted to the supporting structure at the level of antenna attachment. Under no circumstances shall antennas be mounted less than twelve (12) feet above ground level. 
(13)  Street light fixtures with stealth wireless facilities. 
a.  On street lights, luminaires and bases should be roughly equal in size and volume for a balanced appearance. 
b.  The decorative base of a street light should be between ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of the pole height. 
c.  The length of arms extending from the base should be between twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) percent of pole height; 
d.  Arms should extend from the pole at a location within twenty (20) percent of pole height from the top of the pole. 
e.  Street light fixtures must meet AASHTO structural guidelines for roadway application and ANSI requirements for vibrations. 
f.  Pole height shall be measured from the ground to the top of the utility pole, which measurement shall include any antennas built into or appended to the utility pole. 
(14)  New or replacement poles that support wireless or communications facilities shall match the style, design, and color of the utility poles in the surrounding area. 
(15)  The size and height of new wireless or communications facilities in the rights-of-way shall be no greater than the maximum size and height of any other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way within the city other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred (500) feet, the height of the utility pole shall be limited to fifty (50) feet, unless the city determines that a lower height is warranted given the location context for compatibility with existing or planned development within the vicinity of the proposed location or other provision of this article warrants such; provided however, that registrants proposing wireless or communications facilities with antennas to be located on existing poles or other structures may increase the height of the existing pole or other structure up to six (6) feet, if necessary, to avoid adversely affecting existing pole attachments; and provided further that the overall height above ground of any wireless or communications facility shall not exceed forty (40) feet or exceed the existing height of other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way, whichever height is less. 
(16)  Wireless and communications facilities shall be located at least ten (10) feet from a driveway, at least ten (10) feet from the edge of existing trees twelve (12) inches or greater in diameter, at least twenty-five (25) feet from a traffic signal pole unless mounted upon such traffic signal pole, and at least fifteen (15) feet from any pedestrian ramp and eight (8) feet from the street curb. The city may require greater setbacks from these and other fixtures in the right-of-way to ensure proper sight lines for public safety purposes and in other cases as deemed necessary to advance the purposes of this article. 
(17)  If the right-of-way is within or abuts a residential zoning district, wireless and other communication facilities must be located where the shared property line between two (2) residential parcels intersects the right-of-way, whenever possible unless an unsafe condition, cluttered appearance, or other violation of this article would result. 
(18)  If the right-of-way is within or abuts a nonresidential district, wireless and communications facilities must be located between tenant spaces or adjoining properties where their shared property lines intersect the right-of-way, whenever possible, unless an unsafe condition, cluttered appearance, or other violation of this article would result. 
(19)  The city, in consultation with the city engineer where appropriate, may waive any requirement under this section if the city determines that such requirement is not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a wireless or other communications facility or that such requirement imposes an excessive expense, or where the waiver serves the intent or purposes of this article. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request. 
(j)  New structures; availability of alternatives. No new utility pole, pole-type structure, or other freestanding structure shall be allowed in the rights-of-way unless the applicant demonstrates and staff and the city commission determines that no existing structure or alternative technology that does not require the placement of a new structure in a right-of-way can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility. Such a demonstration by the applicant shall not give rise to a right to locate the proposed facility within the rights-of-way or in any way guarantee city approval of such. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city commission related to the availability of suitable existing structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed communications facility may consist of, but is not limited to, the following factors to be considered by the city commission: 
(1)  No existing structures are located within the geographic area which would meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements, which shall be demonstrated by, at minimum, propagation and coverage maps. 
(3)  Existing structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing structures, or the antenna on the existing structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing structure or to adapt an existing structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of new structures, such as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new structure or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(k)  Waivers and exemptions. The city commission may waive or reduce the burden of any requirement of this section where doing so serves the intent or purposes of this article. 
(l)  Limitations; no property right. A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(m)  Construction; maintenance; safety; inspection; and restoration. 
(1)  A registrant shall maintain its communication facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law.

(3)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communication facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended. For twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(4)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended. 
(5)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. The person constructing, installing, and maintaining wireless facilities must be a licensed electrician, certified to work as a lineworker, or successfully complete an accredited lineworker apprenticeship program. 
(6)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any utilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(7)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(n)  Removal and relocation. 
(1)  The grant of a permit under this article shall not limit the authority and discretion of the city to regulate and control the public rights-of-way, and the city may at any time require the removal or relocation of a wireless or other communications facility within the rights-of-way in the interests of the public welfare, health, or safety, or as otherwise authorized by law. The registrant must remove its wireless facilities within thirty (30) days notice that the city will remove a utility pole. 
(2)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by applicable requirements of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended, in addition to any other applicable city regulations or provisions of law. Unless otherwise provided by law, this Code, or agreement, a registrant shall bear all costs of any removal or relocation of its facilities. 
(o)  Coordination of work; work schedule. Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable time frame in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions. 
(p)  No warranties; vacation of rights-of-way. The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the city's public rights-of-way, city-owned structures, and city-owned real property for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add to, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, or add vehicular travel lanes, and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(q)  Alteration of rights-of-way; other work and facilities in rights-of-way. 
(1)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(2)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wireless or other communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of temporarily raising or lowering facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(3)  Replacement and maintenance of wireless facilities. The city shall not require approval or require fees or other charges for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  Replacement of existing wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar or of the same or smaller size; or 
c.  a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under F.S. ch. 202. 
Notwithstanding this paragraph, for public safety, the wireless provider must give reasonable notice to the city's public works department before undertaking these activities and a right-of-way permit shall be required for work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane. 
(4)  The city may charge an annual connection fee for each small wireless facility collocated upon a city utility pole in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). 
(r)  Additional authority; permit conditions. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law and this chapter, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within all or parts of the public rights-of-way. The city may impose reasonable conditions upon the grant of a permit, in addition to the specific requirements of this code, as deemed appropriate to advance the intent or purposes of this article and as is consistent with the law. 
(s)  The approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility or other communications facility pursuant to this article does not authorize the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any facility other than that approved. 
(t)  Make-ready for collocation. 
(1)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility shall provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city shall not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(2)  The city shall not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. 
(3)  Fees for make-ready work shall not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications service providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and shall not include any consultant fee or expense. 
(4)  Fees for make-ready work must be paid to the city, even if they exceed the applicant's estimate, before the wireless facilities may be operational.

(Ord. No. 2017-12, § 1, 12-7-2017) 
Sec. 20-9. - Involuntary termination of registration. 
(a)  The city may terminate a registration if: 
(1)  A federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communications services; 
(2)  The registrant's placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the registrant fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of written notice; or

(b)  Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the city manager or designee with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) is applicable as the reason therefor, and describing the proposed action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the city manager or designee, to accomplish the same. If the plan is rejected, the city manager or designee shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to the city commission regarding a decision as to termination of registration. A decision by the city to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the city commission. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the city commission to terminate its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven (7) days after the decision. 
(c)  In the event of termination, the former registrant shall: (i) notify the city of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the registrant's communications facilities in public rights-of-way; or (ii) provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way. If a registrant fails to comply with this subsection, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the facilities or requiring the registrant within ninety (90) days of the termination, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before the removal. 
(d)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(e)  In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the city to cause the removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and is registered with the city if required.

If no appeal is filed and if the violation is not cured within the 30-day period, the city may collect all fines owed, beginning with the first day of the violation, through any means allowed by law. 
(d)  In determining which remedy is appropriate, the city shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the city determines are appropriate to the public interest. In any proceeding before the city where there exists an issue with respect to a registrant's performance of its obligations pursuant to this article, the registrant shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this article.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
Overview 
The City of Flagler Beach is located in southern Flagler County, approximately thirty-one (31) miles south of St. Augustine and twenty (20) miles north of Daytona Beach. The City covers approximately three and eight-tenths (3.8) square miles (two thousand four hundred twenty (2,420) acres) in area and has a population of approximately five thousand four hundred (5,400) permanent residents (2000 Census). 
The RMPK Group was contracted by the City of Flagler Beach to conduct a Downtown Master Planning process, analyze the existing conditions within the Study Area, and prepare a comprehensive strategy to validate and implement the recommendations of the Charrette. The guidelines established in this report build on the recommendations presented in the Downtown Master Plan and visioning workshops during the earlier phases of the master planning process. 
Objectives 
The purpose of the City of Flagler Beach Downtown Design Guidelines is to provide a basis for evaluating development and redevelopment proposals and act as a guide for making decisions about public and private improvements within the boundaries of the Downtown Study Area. It is anticipated that through the use of the guidelines, both private and public projects will endeavor to preserve and enhance the form, scale, and visual character of its Downtown. 
The design guidelines will provide the framework for redevelopment to gradually take place based on the community's vision for preserving its Old Florida character; and ensure that new buildings or public space will reinforce the City's unique identity. In particular, the guidelines are designed to support the following objectives in accordance with the Downtown Flagler Beach Master Plan and the Comprehensive Plan: 
•  Create a mixed-use environment that respects the traditional character of the Downtown. 
•  Provide improved visual and physical connectivity between the different land uses within the Downtown Study Area. 
•  Develop a distinctive and attractive visual character that is unique to the City of Flagler Beach. 
•  Conserve Downtown Flagler Beach's traditional residential neighborhoods. 
•  Establish an attractive, safe and efficient traffic circulation system that encourages pedestrian mobility in a compact urban form. 
•  Encourage retail oriented mixed-use development with enhanced streetscape elements within the Downtown Master Plan boundaries. 
•  Preservation, protection and conservation of natural resources. 
•  Allow design flexibility in development/redevelopment of properties in the Downtown Planning Area. 
Methodology 
The Downtown Master Plan designates the boundaries of the Downtown Planning area as follows: "The study area is bounded by the A1A corridor on the east, city owned properties along Flagler Avenue on the west, 9th Street North to the north and 9th Street South as the southern extent." 
The Design Guidelines establish three (3) planning areas within the designated Downtown area (see Figure 1, Overlay Character Districts Map), based on existing land uses, zoning classifications, desired development characteristics and geographic locations. The three (3) areas represent distinct character districts of the Downtown that create a functional whole, each of which emulate the design guidelines, and the goals of the Community Redevelopment Agency. The character areas are as follows: 
(1)  Downtown Mixed-Use District-Provides general guidelines for commercial and mixed-use areas in the Downtown Core excluding the parcels located along the Oceanshore Boulevard. 
(2)  Downtown A1A Core Retail Corridor-Provides design guidelines for properties located along the A1A Corridor. 
(3)  Residential Neighborhoods-Includes general design guidelines for new developments/renovations of residential areas in the Downtown. 
These guidelines define the physical character of each area through the establishment of site planning and architectural design standards based on the community's desired vision for its aesthetic character. These guidelines are intended to illustrate general principles that will assist the City to preserve and enhance the desired character for the Downtown. The proposed design guidelines should not be construed as prescriptive standards and it is through zoning regulations that appropriate minimum standards should be established. 
The Design Guidelines also offer designers a flexible tool for quality and innovation. The guidelines are a descriptive template for maintaining and improving the urban character of downtown without dictating or prescribing a specific style or theme.

Overlay Character Districts 
Relationship to Other Documents 
The viability of the Downtown Area has been a focus of planning initiatives reflected in the past and current city policy documents. The Downtown Design Guidelines build upon policies that are set forth in the CRA Plan for Downtown Flagler Beach. The Community Redevelopment Plan for the Downtown Area of the City of Flagler Beach identifies goals and objectives that serve as the foundation for the principles reflected in the Design Guidelines: 
Goal 1 Overall Redevelopment: Establish Downtown Flagler Beach as a focal point for the community and attract visitors from the entire region 
Objective 1.1 Increase the visual attractiveness and unity of downtown Flagler Beach by identifying a common goal by 2006 
Goal 3 Overall Land Use Goal: Foster a diversified economic base and the efficient use of land in the downtown 
Objective 3.1 Encourage the preservation and restoration of buildings of architectural significance through the review, adoption, and enforcement of a design, in accordance with the Downtown Master Plan 
Policy 3.1.1 The CRA Agency shall encourage the renovation of buildings to promote commercial office and residential and or mixed-use facilities within the designated CRA 
Goal 4 Environmental Goal: Create an attractive, safe and comfortable environment that is conducive to activities during the day and evenings 
Objective 4.1 Maintain city services for sidewalk maintenance and streetscapes. Continue to encourage building improvements by property owners 
Objective 4.4 Emphasize pedestrian orientation in the CRA through streetscape features, pedestrian-scale lighting and street furniture. Begin a phased program by 2006 
Objective 4.5 Begin a visual enhancement program through elimination of visual pollution and by screening surface parking areas with landscaping or other means by 2006 
The City of Flagler Beach Comprehensive Plan identifies the underlying general uses for land. The Comprehensive Plan's main feature for identifying uses is the Future Land Use Element. The Future Land Use Map depicts the location and extent of land uses in accordance with the categories, densities and intensities of land uses contained in this element. 
The current Land Development Regulations for the City of Flagler Beach, as with older communities, encourages suburban oriented development. The current zoning specifies large front setbacks, low density, height limitations and separation of uses. The LDRs were originally established in 1981 and amended in 1987. The guidelines also build upon the City's Combined Use Ordinance to ensure consistency between the planning and regulation documents. Table 1.1 provides a brief description of the existing zoning categories found throughout the three (3) character districts. 
The Design Guidelines are intended to be used as an overlay on the existing zoning categories. Overlay zoning is a technique that applies standards to a designated area that may cut across several different conventional or underlying zoning districts. While not superseding the "underlying" zoning entirely, the guidelines will provide the site design and building design standards for each of the current zoning sub-areas. 
Organization of Guidelines 
The Design Guidelines are organized based on the three (3) character districts identified within the Downtown Master Plan Study Area: (1) Downtown Mixed-Use District; (2) Downtown A1A Retail Corridor; (3) Residential Neighborhoods. The elements from the Land Development Regulations identified in these Design Guidelines are superseded by the proposed overlay districts. Elements not identified in the guidelines are, therefore, still the controlling regulation. The guidelines are organized around the following specific topic areas: 
A.  Area wide guidelines 
There are some elements that should be consistent throughout the Downtown Commercial and Mixed-Use districts. The following elements will provide continuity and consistency for all new development and redevelopment projects-both public and private. Notwithstanding the common elements, it is understood that some flexibility and case-by-case analysis will be required. 
Common elements within the Downtown Mixed-Use District and Downtown A1A Retail Corridor 
1.  Streetscape Design 
Sidewalks, Street Trees, Lighting, Signage, Street Furniture 
2.  Parking and Vehicular Circulation 
3.  Public Open Space 
4.  Service, Refuse, and Delivery Design 
5.  Landscaping 
6.  Architectural Styles 
B.  Building Design 
The intent of the building design guidelines is to develop a system of architectural criteria to guide the future development of the established planning areas. The following elements are addressed in Downtown Mixed-Use District and Downtown A1A Retail Corridor: 
1.  Massing 
2.  Building Height 
3.  Facade Guidelines 
4.  Roof line Treatment 
5.  Architectural Elements 
6.  Exterior Materials 
C.  Site Planning 
The intent of the site planning guidelines is to develop a system of planning criteria to guide the future development of Downtown Flagler Beach. The guidelines provide development standards that will reinforce and enhance the relationship of each new building to the public street as well as the relationship of the new buildings to each other and to existing buildings. In addition, these site-planning standards will encourage development to provide adequate parking and vehicular connectivity. 
The following elements are addressed in the Downtown Mixed-Use District and Downtown A1A Retail Corridor: 
1.  Building Placement 
2.  Build-To Zone 
3.  Frontage Guidelines 
4.  Barriers and Buffers 
5.  Parking

CHAPTER 2. AREA WIDE GUIDELINES 
Streetscape Design 
Streetscape Design is an integral component of the public realm improvements that will help achieve the desired character and vision for Downtown Flagler Beach. The sidewalks should be landscaped, where possible, to provide shade and aesthetic appeal and should also include streetscape elements such as brick or concrete pavers, for visual interest. At crosswalk locations, brick or concrete pavers should be used to emphasize the crosswalk area and to add to the visual appeal of downtown. Bulb-outs (see Figure 2, Intersection Design) should be integrated into the streetscape design when possible. Bulb-outs are extensions built into the sidewalk at key intersections that provide rest areas for pedestrians and also shorten the crossing distance. Because pedestrians remain on sidewalk as far as the outer edge of cars parked on the street, they have better visibility of the traffic before crossing the street and are also more visible to drivers. The expansion of sidewalks and public spaces will not only improve pedestrian connectivity, but will also provide public places for congregation. As the physical environment is improved, an increasing number of cafes and restaurants may use a portion of this space for exterior seating. 
The intent of the Streetscape Design Guidelines is to provide direction for improvements to the public right-of-way that create a pedestrian friendly environment and enhance the identity of the area, complementing the recommendations of the Downtown Flagler Beach Master Plan. The principal objective of the guidelines is to promote a long-term, coordinated strategy that includes improvements to both the public and private realm to create a unified urban design theme that enhances the beach town character of Downtown Flagler Beach. 
The design guidelines for the streetscape improvements employs a combination of Primary (Formal) and Secondary (Informal) streetscapes, based on a hierarchy of streets and design treatment. The Master Plan identifies the following primary streets in the Study Area that have the highest priority for implementation, and should incorporate formal design elements as discussed above: 
Moody Boulevard (Flagler Avenue to A1A) 
A1A (S. 3rd Street to N. 3rd Street) 
Central Avenue (S. 3rd Street to N. 3rd Street) 
S. 2nd Street (A1A to Daytona Avenue) 
S. 3rd Street (A1A to Daytona Avenue) 
N. 2nd Street (A1A to Flagler Avenue) 
Daytona Ave. (S. 3rd Street to Moody Blvd.) 
Illustration 3 
Primary (formal) Streetscape improvements in the Downtown Core should include: 
•  Sidewalks 
•  Street Trees 
•  Street Lights 
•  Signage 
•  Street Furniture 
•  Stormwater Drainage systems 
•  Enhanced pedestrian crosswalks 
The goal of the secondary streetscape improvements incorporating "informal" design standards is to preserve the unique "beach-town" character of Flagler Beach building on the traditional landscape features. The secondary streetscape improvements will follow a phased approach based on availability of funds and includes the streets surrounding the Downtown Core. As new development occurs, opportunities to improve the pedestrian environment and aesthetics should be pursued in areas surrounding the Downtown Core with a gradual transition into the residential neighborhoods within the entire Study Area. 
Objective 
Maintain the traditional landscape character while incorporating formal streetscape elements to invigorate the Downtown Core as a pedestrian oriented retail environment. 

Illustration 4 
I. Sidewalks 
The pedestrian context of a street relies on the function and form of the sidewalks. In terms of form, a wide street with no median and/or traffic calming measures create a barrier for pedestrians while crossing the major roadways. Given Downtown Flagler Beach's civic, recreational and commercial anchors, the sidewalk network should be enhanced to create a walkable environment. Currently, four (4) to five (5) foot sidewalks are provided along sections of the arterial corridors (west side of Oceanshore Boulevard and both sides of Moody Boulevard) and along the periphery of Veteran's Park (South 2nd Street from A1A to Central Avenue and Central Avenue from South 2nd Street to Moody Boulevard). However, in most of the other areas including the residential neighborhoods, the sidewalks are not paved. 
During the public workshops, the community expressed its desire to construct sidewalks within the Downtown Core to create a pedestrian environment that supports local retail businesses. In addition, the community emphasized its desire to maintain its "eclectic" beach town" character in the transitional and residential areas of Downtown. 
Because of limited public rights-of-way widths available, sidewalks in Downtown Flagler Beach have been traditionally devoid of planting strips/amenity zones separating pedestrians from traffic. Physical separation from traffic is important to increase pedestrian comfort and also enhances the aesthetics of an area. Provision of sidewalks/public space should be required for mixed-use buildings within the Downtown Core as discussed in the Downtown Mixed-Use Overlay District guidelines. As defined in the Streetscape Design section, "formal design" elements should incorporate traditional materials in the overall design in order to create an environment that is sensitive to the traditional character of Downtown Flagler Beach. 
Paving is an important unifying element in streetscape design. Using pervious paving materials such as crushed coquina stone and open paving blocks to minimize runoff and increase infiltration is preferred. While resurfacing existing sidewalks, porous concrete or concrete modular pavers with gapped joints that allow water to percolate should be used. 

Illustration 5 
Design Guidelines 
•  Design streets for minimum required pavement based on traffic volume and speed limits. Use available rights-of-way to maintain a clear unobstructed pedestrian network. 
•  Maximum pavement width of twenty-two (22) feet for road with parking on one side of street. 
•  Maximum pavement width of twenty-four (24) feet for road with parking on both sides of the street. 
•  Maximum pavement width of twenty (20) feet for road with no on-street parking. 
•  Where practical, consider locating sidewalks on one side of the street based on the pedestrian and vehicular traffic volumes. 
•  Use tree grates in retail streets to provide ample space for pedestrian circulation on the sidewalks. 
•  Continue the use of traditional/local materials when repairing or replacing sidewalks, including: 
•  Crushed coquina stone and pervious concrete pavers should be used for sidewalks. 
•  Perforated brick pavers could be used at intersections to accentuate pedestrian crossings. 
•  The five (5) foot or ten (10) foot dimension between the ROW and the "Build-To" zone shall be added to the pedestrian area of the ROW and should be designed as an integral part of the public streetscape design for Downtown Mixed-Use Character District. 
•  The design of the streetscape area should match and be an extension of the public ROW streetscape design theme: paving patterns, plant materials, site furnishings, and parking. 
•  The five (5) feet or ten (10) feet between the ROW and the "Build-To" zone must be devoted entirely to pedestrian sidewalk use. 
•  Sidewalks should be designed to be handicapped accessible as set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 

Illustration 6 
II. Street Trees 
Street trees provide shade, buffer wind, and help reduce stormwater runoff in heavy pedestrian traffic areas. Trees also serve as buffers between automobile traffic and pedestrians, creating a more aesthetically pleasing walkable environment. Tree placement should respond to the local conditions and functional character of the uses on the street. Other factors that affect the tree planting include the volume of pedestrians, sidewalk design, visibility for drivers and pedestrians, and the volume of vehicles. 
Considering the climatic conditions prevalent in the City of Flagler Beach, a palette of native species that are cold and salt tolerant, and wind resistant plants is recommended. (Refer to Appendix A, Landscape Palette) 
Design Guidelines 
•  All selected trees should conform to the microclimate, soils, sun, budget and maintenance environment in which they are planted. Plant materials should conform to the standards for Florida No. 1 or better as given in "Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants", Part I, Current Edition, and Part II, State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, or equal thereto. (Refer to Appendix A for a list of appropriate native species recommended by the TCRPC Downtown Charrette Plan) 
•  Consider mature tree size before planting to ensure ample room for trees to grow. Tree spread should take into consideration the available planting area. 
•  Use tree grates instead of planting strips/tree lawns where pedestrian traffic is high to ensure wider sidewalks. 
•  Existing trees and plant material in healthy condition must be protected during construction. 
•  Require one (1) street tree per forty (40) linear feet or fraction thereof on the perimeter public sidewalk to include a tree grate and location approved by the City in the mixed-use and commercial areas. 
•  Trees should not be placed closer than twenty-five (25) feet from the curb at intersections and street corners within the corner triangle. Trees must not interfere with the visibility of traffic control devices especially at intersections.

III. Lighting 
Pedestrian and street lighting play an important role in enhancing the pedestrian experience and greatly improves the quality and safety of streets and public spaces. Pedestrian scaled lighting design is pivotal in improving the visual character of retail oriented areas in Downtown. Pedestrian lighting consists of fixtures less than fourteen (14) feet high and should be based on the uses on a street. Street lighting is equally important in creating a safe environment. FDOT owns and maintains street lighting on Moody Boulevard and A1A. The intent of these guidelines is to encourage effective and innovative lighting to be incorporated as an integral component of each new public and private project. The use of lighting should be integrally designed as part of the built environment and should reflect a balance for the lighting needs with the contextual ambient light level and surrounding night time characteristics of Downtown Flagler Beach. 
Lighting should be designed from an aesthetic and contextual perspective. Sea turtle friendly, low lights of a modest scale should be installed both in private development and public realm improvements. Lights should be located at the four (4) corners of an intersection and should relate to the desired overall character of the Downtown. (Refer to Section 4.04.04 Lighting standards for new development, Land Development Regulations for more information). 
Design Guidelines 
•  Retain the design of the existing lighting fixture. 
•  Metal poles and lighting fixtures should be avoided in outdoor lighting when replacing and/or installing new fixtures. 
•  Lighting should be designed to minimize the illumination cast on adjacent residential areas by directing the lights towards the interior of the property and/or by reducing the wattage or candle power of the lights. 
•  Minimize artificial lighting illuminating along the beach such that the source of light and any reflective surfaces of the fixture should not be directly visible to the beach users. 
•  Lights should not directly or indirectly illuminate the beach during the sea turtle nesting season. 
•  Single luminaires should be preferred over multiple luminaires, which should be considered only for gateway or entry points. 

IV. Signage 
The aesthetic quality of a streetscape design is affected by the visual harmony of the signs as they relate to the overall architecture and functional character of the Downtown. Signage guidelines include private business, public wayfinding and regulatory signage. All signs installed on buildings must conform to Article VII, Signs, of the City's Land Development Regulations. 
V. Street Furniture 
Street furniture is an important functional component of streetscape design to complete the pedestrian environment in a commercial setting. Street furnishings could include a combination of seating, trash receptacles, tree grates, bike racks, and newspaper stands. Maintenance, safety, cost, and comfort are primary considerations in the design and placement of street furniture. Street furniture may be provided when the public right-of-way allows for a clear pedestrian walking zone and separate seating areas. Furniture should also be incorporated in parking lots, public parks and plazas as part of mixed-use developments. 
Design Guidelines 
•  Encourage the use of recyclable material, wind and corrosion resistant street furnishings. Wood, concrete or recycled materials are the preferred materials. 
•  Ensure that pedestrian seating areas are illuminated and does not interfere with plant materials or pedestrian circulation. 
•  Trash receptacles should be easily accessible for pedestrians and trash collection. 

Illustration 10 
VI. Intersection Design 
Signalized intersections and pedestrian crosswalks are currently painted along the primary corridors in the Downtown. Crosswalk materials and patterns could be a critical unifying element of the pedestrian environment in the Downtown. Crosswalk pavement should contrast with the adjacent street pavement at identified locations to reduce the speed of automobile traffic and guide the pedestrians to areas where they can cross the street safely. The City should work with FDOT to institute traffic calming measures along A1A and Moody Boulevard (SR 100) within the Downtown area. 
Design Guidelines 
•  Clear space to handle pedestrian capacities. 
•  Incorporate intersection design elements including: 
•  Visibility to safely negotiate crossing 
•  Legibility of all directional information 
•  Accessibility and freedom from obstructions 
•  Separation from traffic 
•  Code based ramps and landings 
•  Traffic calming features should be utilized where traffic data and neighborhood consensus warrants. 
•  Consider raised brick crosswalk at identified intersections on A1A Corridor. 
•  Consider crosswalks with midblock pedestrian refuges along Moody Boulevard between Central Avenue and Daytona Avenue, if feasible. 

Illustration 11 

Illustration 12 
The street sections illustrated show typical conditions that should be adjusted at the major roadways and secondary streets in the Downtown. 
Oceanshore Boulevard (A1A) 
Oceanshore Boulevard or A1A serves as the primary entrance to the City of Flagler Beach accommodating large volumes of traffic through the downtown. The A1A is a designated Florida Scenic Highway providing enhanced views and access to the Atlantic shoreline. Streetscape features should be designed to incorporate elements such as bulb-outs, speed tables to buffer pedestrians from traffic impacts, detached sidewalks with tree grates, improved beach access points, on-street parking and landscaping. 
Moody Boulevard (SR 100) 
Moody Boulevard connects the downtown with I-95 and the Bunnell and Palm Coast via the SR 100 Intracoastal Bridge. Currently, Moody Boulevard lacks pedestrian character and physically bisects the northern and southern parts of the Downtown. Streetscape treatment should emphasize well-designed pedestrian crosswalks linking the north and south sides of the roadway. This should also include landscaped medians, street lighting, tree planting, and where possible trees defined by grates in the sidewalk. 
Central Avenue 
Central Avenue is the local collector connecting the Downtown with the residential neighborhoods. The two-lane roadway provides the main pedestrian connections to a variety of uses including public uses (Flagler Beach Museum, Veteran's Park, City Hall, Farmer's Market). The existing streetscape exhibits a combination of formal and informal elements in certain sections including sidewalks, street furniture, and on-street parking. The use of similar materials, extension of sidewalks, landscaping and street trees will help unify the overall image of the Downtown. 

Illustration 13 
Parking 
Parking is the most influential element in designing an efficient automobile and pedestrian traffic circulation system. During the Downtown Master Plan public workshops, the lack of convenient parking was among the primary concerns expressed by the residents and business owners. A combination of on-street parking, public parking surface lots and shared parking provisions should be incorporated to address the parking demand for Downtown Flagler Beach. Although the right-of-way widths in the Downtown are limited, on-street parking can be accommodated within most of the Downtown Mixed-Use District and A1A Commercial Retail Corridor without interrupting the sidewalk network. The parking lane also provides another layer of separation between the pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
The City of Flagler Beach Land Development Regulations address the parking and landscaping requirements for each zone district and use. All buildings and land uses, including a change, expansion or renovation of a building or change in land use, shall provide parking areas in accordance with the Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements, Section 2.06.02.1, Land Development Regulations and Section 5.04.00, Landscaping, Land Development Regulations. 
Design Guidelines 
On-Street Parking 
•  Maximize on-street parking within the public right-of-way employing a combination of innovative strategies such as angled and parallel parking spaces, reducing the minimum stall dimensions and establishing a minimum percentage of total spaces to be designed for small cars. 
•  Use materials and textures to delineate parking spaces that reflect the traditional beach town character of the Downtown. Crushed coquina stone and recycled timbers are the preferred materials. 
•  Provide clear signage to direct traffic to on-street parking areas and public parking lots. 
•  When possible minimize curb cuts along street frontage by providing surface parking behind buildings to increase the on-street parking areas. 
•  Parking spaces should provide clear markings to indicate where drivers should park. 

Illustration 14 
Design Guidelines 
Off-Street Parking 
Within the Downtown Mixed-Use District and Downtown A1A Mixed-Use District, a combination of off-street parking and on-street parking in accordance with the Schedule of Off-Street parking requirements, the Combined Use Ordinance and the Downtown Master Plan Parking Plan is permitted to satisfy the parking requirements. On-street parking shall not exceed forty (40) percent of required off-street parking. 
Location 
1.  On-street parking shall be provided along the perimeter of the development parcel, on the public right-of-way. 
2.  Street or sidewalk areas may not be used for off-street parking purposes. Individual ingress and egress drives extending across the public sidewalks and curbs and connecting the off-street parking spaces to the public street areas shall not exceed a maximum of twelve (12) feet for a one-way drive and eighteen (18) feet for a two-way drive. 
3.  Required off-street parking should be located on the same parcel as the uses served. 
4.  Off-street parking shall be limited to the sides or rear of the building(s) and screened from street view with appropriate perimeter landscape material per Section 5.04.02, Criteria for parking lots and vehicular use, Land Development Regulations. No off-street parking shall be located between a building and the adjacent street frontage. 
5.  Joint common access drives and shared parking provisions are encouraged for two (2) or more contiguous interior lots owned exclusively or under separate ownership to enhance two-way access thereby decreasing access width from fifteen (15) feet to twelve (12) feet for each lot. 

Illustration 15 
Parking Design 
1.  Maximum parking stall dimensions for off-street parking and on-street parking should include the following principles: 
a.  Parallel parking space eight (8) by twenty-two (22) feet long constructed of a pervious material approved by the City. 
b.  Sixty (60) degree or less (one-way) and ninety (90) degree (one-way) parking space should have minimum parking dimensions of eight and six-tenths (8.6) feet wide by twenty (20) feet long with an aisle width of eighteen (18) feet. 
c.  Ninety (90) degree (two-way) parking should have a minimum width of eight and six-tenths (8.6) feet by eighteen (18) feet. The minimum aisle width in this case should be twenty-two (22) feet. 
d.  One (1) foot continuous concrete strip to separate the adjacent parking space from the traffic way and to maintain the integrity of the asphalt edge of street pavement extending the length of the designated parallel parking strip. 
e.  Parking space strips separated by hard-surface material (e.g. concrete, pavers) extending the full width of the parking space per City approval. 
3.  Shared parking requirements. The use of shared parking shall be encouraged when the development is under the control of a single owner/developer and contains commercial, retail, office, institutional or public uses. 
4.  Parking lot design and layout as per Section 5.04.00 Landscaping, Land Development Regulations. 
5.  Parking should be located so that it does not break the continuity along the sidewalk. 
Vehicular Circulation 
1.  Curb cut access to property from front property line should be minimized and where possible shared parking should be encouraged. 
2.  Vehicular access should be provided, where possible, from side streets, rear streets, alleys or adjacent properties only. 
3.  Internal access drives should join together existing public streets and should line up with adjacent private drives. 
4.  Internal parking lots should connect with adjacent parking lots where possible. 

Illustration 16 
Public Open Space 
•  Provide additional pedestrian area to the major public streetscape adjacent to the property. Sidewalks should be provided, abutting the property frontage extending the length of the property whether or not on-street parking is required. 
•  Sidewalks should be constructed per City approval and should be a minimum of six (6) feet in width. 
•  Provide a pedestrian environment that complements the major public streetscape design. 
•  When properties front on public streets, they shall be designed to provide a continuity of streetscape elements. The frontage yard between the building and the property line shall be designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic, seating or other use deemed suitable by approval of the Planning and Architectural Review Board. 
•  Provide visual and physical access to adjacent pedestrian areas. 
•  Open Space such as urban plazas and internal walkways should be encouraged connecting the A1A Retail Corridor and the Downtown Mixed-Use District. 
Service, Refuse and Delivery Design 
Location 
1.  Service, refuse, and delivery areas should be located to the rear of the buildings with convenient vehicular access, unless facing a single-family residence or the front of another building; in which case service areas shall be shielded from view of adjacent buildings. 
2.  Locate trash storage, loading, and truck parking so as to minimize visibility from the street/sidewalk and building entrances. Avoid locating service and loading areas along important view corridors and pedestrian traffic areas. 
Screening 
1.  All exterior trash receptacles should be screened from view. 
2.  Screen loading docks and truck parking from public view using building mass, free-standing walls, and/or landscaping. 
3.  Ensure that all utility equipment is located, sized, and designed to be as inconspicuous as possible. All utility runs should be located underground, wherever possible. 

Illustration 17 
Landscaping 
Applicability 
The landscape standards discussed below apply to all projects and parking lots within the Downtown Mixed-Use District and the Downtown A1A Mixed-Use Corridor. These guidelines are not applicable to the Residential Neighborhoods. Landscaping features within the "overlay character districts" should be designed and installed in compliance with Section 5.04.00 Landscaping, Land Development Regulations. These guidelines are intended to supplement the City's existing codes relating to the landscaping requirements. 
Design Guidelines 
•  Landscaping improvements in the area between the building and the property line abutting the public sidewalk should utilize native vegetation and plantings approved by the Planning and Architectural Review Board. 
•  Street trees should be included in the planting strips in all new developments and public realm improvements. (Refer to II, Street Trees). 
•  Groundcovers in planting areas shall be consistent with adopted Streetscape Design Guidelines. 
•  Parking lots next to sidewalks visible from public right-of-way or adjacent residential areas should be dense enough to screen from headlight glare and the movement of traffic generated by vehicles using the parking area. 
•  Barriers and buffers should be designed such that they encourage internal pedestrian movement and vehicular movement between adjacent mixed-use properties. 
•  Off-street parking shall have at least ten (10) percent of the total gross parking area devoted to living landscape, which includes grass, ground cover, plants, shrubs and trees. The gross parking area is to be measured from the edge of the parking and/or driveway paving and sidewalks, extended five (5) feet in all directions, but is not to include any area enclosed by the building or covered by a building overhang. 
•  When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way or when the subject property abuts the intersection of two (2) or more public rights-of-way, all landscaping shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility, provided they are located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except required grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three (3) feet from the edge of any accessway pavement or sidewalk or walk path. 
Architectural Styles 
This section illustrates a conceptual approach to establish minimum architectural standards for future development projects. The primary goal of the Design Guidelines is to ensure that each individual site design, architectural and streetscape project contribute to the positive image of Downtown Flagler Beach. 
The building elements outlined are inspired from a study of historic buildings in Downtown Flagler Beach and should be incorporated to enhance the area's unique and authentic character. The architect/developer is encouraged to provide innovative design solutions which may not meet the exact details of the guidelines. However, it is the responsibility of the architect to convince the City and the Planning and Architectural Review Board that the proposed design solutions are compatible with the traditional architectural character of the adjacent properties. 
Appropriate Architectural Styles 
While the architectural requirements do not recommend a specific design theme for buildings, it is encouraged that projects proposed in the Study Area must select one (1) of the four (4) main architectural styles in each Character District. In order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community, it is recommended to incorporate a combination of architectural styles on any combination of buildings that exceed one hundred fifty (150) linear feet of frontage on a single lot, or combination of lots, the enforcement of which, is subject to approval by the Planning Director and the City of Flagler Beach Planning and Architectural Board. The four (4) architectural styles recommended for the Study Area include: 
•  Florida Frame Vernacular 
•  Key West Caribbean Style 
•  Bungalow Style 
•  Classic Revival 

Illustration 18

Classic Revival 
From 1890-1930, the Classic Revival style was associated with major public buildings and private residences designed by trained architects. 
This style can be seen in a number of different building types within the State of Florida. Some were built as early as 1890's but this style did not gain wider popularity until the early 1900's. Over the following decades Classic Revival influenced the design of both commercial and public buildings such as courthouses and especially banks. This style can be seen in the Old Moody Hotel building. (Refer to illustration below.) 
Characteristics

CHAPTER 3. DOWNTOWN MIXED-USE DISTRICT 
Downtown Mixed-Use District 
The Downtown Mixed-Use Overlay Character District includes all lands situated between the area defined in the map on the Downtown Mixed-Use District Boundary Map. The area illustrated in the Map is defined by the CRA Boundary to the north, South 5th Street to the south, Flagler Avenue to the west, and properties east of Central Avenue, half a block west of A1A form the eastern extent. The Downtown Mixed-Use District is anticipated to support a mix of active uses at street level and low-rise medium density residential uses on the upper floors. New commercial only development in the Downtown Mixed-Use District should be consistent with the architectural and site design principles established for the Downtown Mixed-Use District. 
Goals 
The urban design goals for this district are: 
1.  Enhance the pedestrian scale environment while retaining the eclectic beach town character. 
2.  Develop strong linkages between the residential neighborhoods and the Downtown. 
3.  Create a harmonious character that incorporates the City's historical and cultural heritage. 
4.  Provide flexible site development principles while maintaining a high level of aesthetic element. 
5.  Maintain a sense of connection with the traditional single-family houses while accommodating a mix of residential and beach oriented commercial uses. 
Scope 
The Downtown Mixed-Use District contains varying types of lot sizes and configurations ranging from parcels fronting the arterial roads and secondary streets to interior lots and vacant lots covering the entire blocks. The development proposals should be evaluated on a site-specific level because of the variations in lot sizes and orientation and the unique conditions presented by each individual parcel. The following lot configurations have been taken into consideration in the development of design guidelines for the Downtown Mixed-Use District: 
1.  Interior Lots-fifty (50) feet by one hundred (100) feet 
2.  Corner Lots 
3.  Frontage along major arterial roads (Moody Boulevard) 
4.  Redevelopment opportunities at block level

Site Design 
The intent of the site planning guidelines is to develop a system of planning criteria that would direct the future development of Downtown Flagler Beach in a more ordered environment. The guidelines aim to create an urban design framework and definition for the Downtown that provides a civic and cultural quality of life for the citizens. In addition, the guidelines reinforce and enhance the public realm improvements within the Downtown and encourage new development to provide a unified system of parking and vehicular connectivity.

Building Design 
The built environment is vital in maintaining an area's visual integrity and unique character. Traditionally sized and smaller scaled buildings help to establish a pedestrian scale and also maintain the character of the Downtown. The guidelines discussed in this section are applicable primarily to properties located in the Downtown Mixed-Use Overlay District. 
Guidelines 
•  All new development, additions and/or renovations should reflect the traditional development patterns and strive to encourage an efficient pedestrian oriented environment. 
•  New buildings should incorporate a clear division between street level and upper floors through a change of architectural elements, materials, and/or color. 
•  Use architectural features to accentuate the eclectic character of Downtown Flagler Beach when possible. When possible relate entries, window lines, awnings and canopies, and sign locations to adjacent buildings. 
•  Relate to adjoining residential neighborhoods with scale, detail and material at the edges of the Downtown Mixed-Use District. 

Illustration 39 
I. Massing 
Intent 
Buildings that appear similar in mass and scale to other buildings in the Downtown will help to maintain the unique beach town character. It is important to maintain a variety of heights to create visual interest. One-, two- and three-story buildings should form the primary architectural character of the Downtown, with taller architectural elements located at corner buildings to emphasize the importance of intersections and create diversity in scale and character. 
•  In order to minimize the perceived size of a building, step down its height toward the street, neighboring structures and the rear of the lot. 
•  In order to break up the perceived mass of structure, divide it into modules that are similar in size to buildings seen traditionally. 
Guideline: Vertical Setbacks 
1.  Front: There should be a minimum setback of six (6) feet between the second and third floor of the building, when possible. 
2.  Side facing a street: There should be a minimum setback of six (6) feet between the second and third floor of the building, when possible. 
3.  Side facing a property line: Between the second and third floor of the building, no minimum setback is required. 
4.  Rear: Between the second and third floor of the building, no minimum setback is required. 
Bands of Composition 
1.  Buildings should be designed to establish the following three (3) bands of vertical composition: 
Base (one (1) story), 
Mid-section (second and third stories), 
Top (Roof) 
Illustration 40 
II. Building Height 
Building heights are identified by the number of stories above grade and is measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade at the center of the front of the building to: 
1.  The highest point of the roof surface for a flat roof 
2.  To the deck line of a mansard roof 
3.  To the mean height level between eaves and ridge for gable, hip and gambrel roofs 
Design Guidelines 
•  Building height shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet above the finished grade for flat roofs and mean height level between eaves and ridge for pitched, gable and hipped roofs. 
•  The ground floor shall not be less than ten (10) feet from the finished floor to finished ceiling. Above the ground floor, a story is defined as a habitable level no more than twelve (12) feet in height, the additional height will count as an additional story. 
•  The proportional relationship of height and width should be consistent between adjacent structures. 
•  The height of buildings should not drastically alter the scale of the Downtown.

Illustration 42 
III. Facade Guidelines 
Guideline: Facade Composition 
There should be a side setback adjacent to the property line of five (5) feet for buildings with a front facade longer than one hundred (100) feet. 
Buildings on a single lot or combination of lots shall not exceed a continuous massing longer than one hundred fifty (150) feet. In order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community, no single architecture style shall be duplicated on any combination of buildings that exceed one hundred fifty (150) linear feet of frontage on a single lot or a combination of lots. 
On the ground floor of the primary facade, there shall be a minimum of two (2) breaks for every forty (40) feet of front elevation. 
Guideline: Relationship to Existing Building 
If a new building is to be placed adjacent to an existing taller building, then the part of the new building that is closest to the existing building should be the tallest part of the new building's elevation, unless the existing building is considered obsolete or non-conforming. 
If a new building is to be placed adjacent to an existing shorter building, then the part of the new building that is closest to the existing building should be the shortest part of the new building's elevation, unless the existing building is considered obsolete or non-conforming. 
Illustration 43 
III. Facade Guidelines 
Guideline: Fenestrations 
Blank Wall Guidelines 
Walls or portions of walls where windows are not provided shall have architectural treatment wherever they face adjacent streets or adjacent residential areas. At least three (3) of the following elements shall be incorporated into a design to achieve the mitigation of the visual impact of the blank wall areas. 
•  Horizontal architectural banding at story breaks 
•  Horizontal siding 
•  Vertical and diagonal clapboards 
•  Projecting canopies 
•  Projecting eaves 
Guideline: Fenestration Ratio 
Encourage largely transparent, open and inviting facades at the lower levels (ground floor) of the building to accentuate pedestrian environment. 
Encourage a greater ratio of solid wall to window allowing for more variety of architectural material and elements at the upper floors. Approximately twenty-five (25) to forty (40) percent window to wall ratio is desirable in the facade area for each building facade area adjoining a street. 
Illustration 44 
IV. Roofline Treatment 
Roofs should be an integral part of the architectural design and form of the buildings in the Downtown. 
a.  Guideline: Overall Roof Design. Variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to and reduce the massing of buildings. Roof features should be in scale with building mass and should complement the character of adjoining or adjacent buildings and neighborhoods. Roofing material should be constructed of durable high quality materials in order to enhance the appearance and attractiveness of the community. 
b.  Guideline: Roof Edge and Parapet Treatments. For buildings with a sloping roof: The roof edge or parapet should have a vertical change (minimum of three (3) feet) from the dominant roof design at least once per forty (40) feet on the first floor. At least one (1) such change should be located on a primary facade adjacent to a collector or arterial right-of-way. 
c.  Guideline: Roofline Breaks. For buildings adjacent to public streets, there should be a minimum of two (2) roofline breaks per forty (40) feet of frontage above the first floor. 

Illustration 45 
V. Architectural Elements 
Roof Eaves 
The roof eaves may encroach a maximum of five (5) feet on all setback lines. 
Balconies 
Balconies may be built six (6) feet into the front and side vertical setbacks above second floor. 
Awnings, Arcades and Canopies 
Awnings and Canopies on the first floor may encroach five (5) feet into the setback if the bottom of the awning is ten (10) feet above the sidewalk and they should be built within the build-to zone of the front and side setbacks. 
Columns, Arches, Piers, Railings and Balustrades 
Columns and piers shall be spaced at intervals of no more than twenty (20) feet. 
Exterior Materials 
The following materials are encouraged for exterior building construction: 
1.  Stucco 
2.  Brick

CHAPTER 4. DOWNTOWN A1A RETAIL DISTRICT 
Downtown A1A Retail Corridor 
The Downtown A1A Retail Corridor includes all properties situated along Oceanshore Boulevard (A1A) between 9th Street North and 9th Street South, identified as commercial uses in the Future Land Use Map. The District is appropriate for low-rise mixed-use buildings that encourage street level uses. Several properties in this district are located seaward from the Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL). This unique condition limits the development of mixed-use buildings in the Downtown A1A Retail District and the Master Plan anticipates the A1A as the primary retail street for Downtown Flagler Beach. Buildings have to be developed at the sidewalk edge and have transparent storefronts to enhance the pedestrian environment. 
The following guidelines presents design principles and alternatives for physical improvements to new private development in the established retail corridor for Downtown Flagler Beach. 
Goals 
The urban design goals for this district are: 
1.  Enhancing the pedestrian experience at the street level while retaining the existing beach town character with a variety of architectural styles. 
2.  Locate on-site parking to minimize visibility from the sidewalk. 
3.  Develop the ground floor level of a building to encourage pedestrian activity. 
4.  Provide guidelines for new development and renovations that reflect the traditional historic character of the Downtown while establishing a more efficient land use and circulation pattern. 


Site Design 
1.  Building Placement 
Interior Lot 
Location 
1.  Locate buildings to the front of the property at the sidewalk edge. 
2.  Develop the ground floor level of a building level to encourage pedestrian activity. 
3.  Maximize street frontage for the building. 
Corner Lot 
1.  Buildings on corner lots should be oriented to the street corner and the pedestrian street. 
2.  Maximize the street frontage of the building. 
3.  Building corner design at intersecting streets of corner lots shall be situated on a diagonal axis to establish architectural character and building frontage ingress/egress and to accommodate a line of vision for vehicular traffic from two (2) streets. 
2.  Minimum Lot Size: None 
3.  Build-To Line 
Build-to lines are established for each property to ensure that building placements clearly define street edges and corners. The build-to line is the line parallel to the property line along which the facade of the building must be located. The maximum front build-to line requirements shall apply to the first story of the building, and higher portions of the building maybe stepped back further from the front property line. 
Front Line: Zero (0) feet 
Side Line: Build to property line on one (1) side, twenty (20) feet on other side. 
Rear Line: Build-to determined by building location and arrangement of parking. 

4.  Building Frontage 
1.  Buildings should be located at or within zero feet of the property line adjoining the street for no less than sixty-five (65) percent of street frontage. When the building is an addition to an existing structure, street frontage should be determined by the total building frontage including the original structure. 
2.  Corner lots should apply the sixty-five (65) percent requirement to the entire perimeter frontage, provided that the build to requirement is met on the majority of any given street frontage. 
5.  Parking 
•  Parking should not be located such that it interrupts the storefront continuity along the sidewalk. 
•  On-site parking should be located behind buildings or to the side of the building, when possible. 
•  Encourage shared parking between adjacent uses, accessed from the rear of the property on corner lots. 
•  Driveways serving on-site parking should be avoided on A1A. When unavoidable, such driveways should have minimal width and should be clearly defined and visible to pedestrians from the sidewalk. 
Maximum amount of off-street parking permitted for all uses in the Downtown A1A Retail District should conform to Section 2.06.02.1 Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements. [For off-site parking layout and design refer to Chapter 2 Area Wide Guidelines, VI Intersection Design, Parking Design Guidelines.] 


I. Massing 
Intent 
Buildings that appear similar in mass and scale to other buildings in the Downtown will help to maintain the human scale of the Downtown's built environment. It is important to maintain a variety of heights to create visual interest. One- and two-storied buildings should form the primary architectural character of the Downtown, with taller architectural elements located at corner buildings to emphasize the importance of intersections and create diversity in scale and character. 
A building's scale is created by the size of the units of construction and architectural details in relationship to the human scale. The size of a building, or more precisely the building's mass in relationship to open spaces, windows, doors, porches and balconies should be compatible with other buildings in a visually related field. The first and second floors should have more detail and frequency of pattern than the upper floors of a building due to the fact that these lower floors are directly adjacent to the viewer's eye. 
•  In order to minimize the perceived size of a building, step down its height toward the street, neighboring structures and the rear of the lot. 
•  In order to break up the perceived mass of structure, divide it into modules that are similar in size to buildings seen traditionally. 


II. Building Height 
Building heights are identified by the number of stories above grade and is measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade at the center of the front of the building to: 
1.  The highest point of the roof surface for a flat roof 
2.  To the deck line of a mansard roof 
3.  To the mean height level between eaves and ridge for gable, hip and gambrel roofs 
Design Guidelines 
•  Building height shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet above the finished grade for flat roofs and mean height level between eaves and ridge for pitched, gable and hipped roofs. 
•  The ground floor shall not be less than ten (10) feet from the finished floor to finished ceiling. Above the ground floor, a story is defined as a habitable level no more than twelve (12) feet in height, the additional height will count as an additional story. 
•  The proportional relationship of height and width should be consistent between adjacent structures. 
•  The height of buildings should not drastically alter the scale of the Downtown. 
III. Facade Guidelines 
Building facades play a basic role in the visual character of the primary retail district. Storefronts, signs, window displays and color are all integral elements of the design. Collectively improved, these elements create visual order. The facade should be intentionally designed to integrate storefront, sign and window display space into the overall fabric of the building exterior. As individual buildings stand side-by-side, visual harmony is created by the similar structural components of the buildings of various styles, age and appearance. Over the years isolated changes in facades, storefronts and signs have altered their visual relationships and have contributed to the eclectic character reflected in today's commercial business district. With proper design attention, a building's appearance from the street can be improved. Attractive individual commercial structures and signs, both old and new, are the basic building blocks of visual order. 

Guideline: Vertical Setbacks 
1.  Front: Between the second and third floor of the building, there should be a minimum setback of six (6) feet when possible. 
2.  Side facing a street: Between the second and third floor of the building, there should be a minimum setback of six (6) feet when possible. 
3.  Side facing a property line: Between the second and third floor of the building, no minimum setback is required. 
4.  Rear: Between the second and third floor of the building, no minimum setback is required. 
Bands of Composition 
1.  Buildings should be designed to establish the following three (3) bands of vertical composition: 
Base (one (1) story), 
Mid-section (second and third stories), 
Top (roof). 
Guideline: Facade Composition 
Buildings on a single lot or combination of lots shall not exceed a continuous massing longer than fifty (50) feet. In order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community, no single architecture style shall be duplicated on any combination of buildings that exceed fifty (50) linear feet of frontage on a single lot or a combination of lots. 
On the ground floor of the primary facade, there shall be a minimum of one (1) break for every fifty (50) feet of front elevation. 
The first floor or the primary facades of a building shall, at a minimum, utilize windows between the heights of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the walkway grade. 

Guideline: Ground Floor Composition 
The ground floor facade should contain a minimum of three (3) of the following facade design elements (one of which must be awnings/canopy): 
1.  Overhangs 
2.  Arcade 
3.  Raised cornice parapets over the doors 
4.  Projected canopies 
5.  Awnings/Canopies 
6.  Projecting Sill 
Guideline: Fenestration Ratio 
Encourage largely transparent, open and inviting facades at the lower levels (ground floor) of the building to accentuate pedestrian environment. 
Encourage a greater ratio of solid wall to window allowing for more variety of architectural material and elements at the upper floors. Approximately twenty-five (25) to forty (40) percent window to wall ratio is desirable in the facade area for each building facade area adjoining a street. 


IV. Architectural Elements 
Roof Eaves 
The roof eaves may extend five (5) feet into the building setback within the property. 
Balconies 
Balconies may be built six (6) feet into the front and side vertical setbacks above the second floor. 
Awnings, Arcades and Canopies 
Awnings, arcades and canopies on the first floor may extend five (5) feet into the building setback if the bottom of the awning is ten (10) feet above the sidewalk and they should be built within the build-to zone of the front and side setbacks. 
Exterior Materials 
The following materials are encouraged for exterior building construction: 
1.  Stucco 
2.  Brick 
3.  Concrete masonry units, e.g. Hardiplank 
4.  Stone 
5.  Wood, Clapboard siding 
6.  Tiles 
The following materials are prohibited for exterior building construction: 
1.  Plastic siding 
2.  Corrugated or reflective metal panels 
3.  Smooth or ribbed-faced concrete block 
4.  Wood sheeting 

CHAPTER 5. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS 
Residential Neighborhood District 
Surrounding Downtown Flagler Beach's commercial retail and mixed-use areas are traditional single-family neighborhoods. The neighborhoods reflect the traditional "eclectic" beach town character of Flagler Beach and should be preserved in all new residential development. These guidelines attempt to identify the design principles and provide guidance with respect to neighborhood context and basic design elements to develop new projects. Although the guidelines do not prescribe any architectural style, it is recommended that new development should be built upon the traditional architectural styles discussed in Chapter 2, Architectural Styles. 
Goals 
The urban design goals for this district are: 
1.  Preserve the traditional character of the residential neighborhoods incorporating design elements that reinforce a historic connection. 
2.  Enhance the sense of public and private open space through sensitive placement of building additions and new structure. 


Illustration 8 
Design Guidelines 
•  Preserve a sense of open space in front, side and rear yards. 
•  Site the mass of the structure to the rear of the lot. 
•  Orient the primary entry of a primary building to the street. 
•  Clearly define the primary entrance by using a raised front porch as a functional space oriented to the street. 
•  Align the front and sides of new buildings with other structures in the neighborhood. 
•  For a lot on an alley, locate parking in a garage or detached carport near the alley edge and accessed from the alley. 
•  For a lot not accessible from an alley, locate parking to the rear of the lot with a driveway accessed from the street. 
•  Required parking spaces should be located in the rear half of the building. 
•  Parking for the primary residence should comply with existing code requirements. 
•  Minimize the visual impact of a driveway. 
•  Plan parking areas and driveways in a manner that minimizes the number of curb cuts on the block. 
•  The design of new development or addition should take into consideration existing trees. Property owners should comply with the City's Tree Preservation Ordinance with regard to Landmark Trees. 
•  Maintain the traditional scale and width of alleys where existing. 
•  Screen parking from public view. 
•  Locate secondary structures to the rear of the lot, and along an alleyway when feasible.

Section 2.06.08.6 Liveaboard vessels in marinas. 
(a)  Liveaboard vessels are permitted only in marinas which have received a special exception for liveaboard vessel use pursuant to Section 2.06.01 and this section. 
(b)  In addition to the criteria for grant of a special exception provided in Section 2.06.01, an applicant has the burden of satisfying all of the following minimum criteria by competent substantial evidence: 
1)  The owner of the marina has the ability to, and shall, come into compliance with all of the requirements set forth herein. 
2)  The number of liveaboard vessels requested is no more than the equivalent of ten density units per acre, calculated by the following formula; provided, however, that no more than fifty (50) percent of the wet boat slips shall be designated for liveaboard vessels. 
Formula for calculating maximum density for liveaboard vessels: 
Number of linear feet of shoreline of the upland property multiplied by the length of the longest dock on upland property, divided by 43,560 (number of square feet in an acre). The quotient is equivalent to acreage. No more than ten liveaboard vessels per equivalent acre shall be granted. 
Example: 1,000 linear feet of shoreline x 150-foot dock = 150,000 
150,000 divided by 43,560 = 3.4 equivalent acres. 
Maximum number of liveaboard vessels allowed: 34* 
*Provided, however, that, if 34 is more than fifty (50) percent of the wet slips, the maximum liveaboard vessels shall be fifty (50) percent of the total number of wet slips. 
3)  Local infrastructure has adequate capacity to support the proposed number of liveaboard vessels. 
4)  Parking for the proposed number of liveaboard vessels shall be calculated in the same way as parking for medium density residential, and the adjacent upland property owned by the applicant must have adequate parking capacity for such liveaboard vessels, in addition to having parking capacity for other uses of the marina. 
5)  Applicant must have a permit from the State for the number of liveaboard vessels for which a special exception is sought. 
(c)  Once the applicant has met this burden, the burden shifts to any opposing party to demonstrate by competent, substantial evidence that the special exception does not meet the minimum criteria or is adverse to the public interest. After consideration of a special exception application for liveaboard vessels at a marina, the city commission may approve, approve with modifications, approve with conditions, or deny the application based on the consideration contained in Section 2.06.01 and herein. 
(d)  A special exception granted pursuant this section may be subject to review at any time and may be revoked after notice to the owner and any lessee at a public hearing by the city commission. The city commission may revoke the special exception permit upon a finding that there have been material violations of any of the criteria set forth in this section or material violations of any conditions of approval, or that the conduct of the owner and any lessee constitutes a public nuisance. The city may institute legal or equitable proceedings to revoke the special exception permit. No applicant who has had a special exception permit revoked shall be allowed to apply for another special exception permit for two (2) years after the revocation date. 
Section 2.06.08.7 Minimum requirements for marinas permitting vessels used for habitation. 
The owner of any marina shall not permit any vessel which is used for habitation to be tied or docked at such marina unless all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The requirements of all applicable laws, codes, and regulations, such as those governing parking, public health, public safety, sanitation, including marine sanitation, and the environment are met. 
2.  Marinas at which vessels used for habitation are docked shall provide an American National Standards Institute approved flammables cabinet of sufficient size for the storage of flammable materials. 
3.  Any marina which allows vessels used for habitation to dock at the facility and which exist on the date this section is enacted shall come into compliance with this section within twelve (12) months from the date of enactment of this Ordinance. 
4.  On shore restroom facilities are available at the marina, which facilities shall comply with all applicable zoning and code regulations. If compliance with this regulation would require the relocation of an existing exterior wall of a principal building, it shall be waived by the city only if the property owner can demonstrate that the proposed restroom facility is no larger than necessary to meet Florida Building Code requirements and the requirements of this section and complies with the zoning regulations to the greatest extent possible as determined by the city. 
Section 2.06.08.8. Floating structures. 
Except as otherwise provided by federal or state law, houseboats which are not self-propelled (cannot be moved under their own power), floating structures, and barges may not be tied or docked in any zoning district in the city. 
Section 2.06.08.9. Bottle clubs. 
    Bottle clubs as defined in Section 2.02.00 are prohibited in all zoning districts of the city.

Those public utility entities which have adopted internal tree or vegetation protection rules and regulations may file a copy of the same with the city manger or designee and so long as such rules and regulations meet or exceed the protections afforded by this ordinance and the utility continues to abide by the same then the city manager or designee may grant an exemption to such utility from the terms of this section. In any event the city manager or designee shall monitor such utility from time to time to see that its internal rules are being complied with and if not may remove any exemption granted pursuant to this section. To the extent any fee sought to be imposed hereby will be offset by a reduction in the city's entitlement to franchise or utility tax funds or fees such tree removal permit fee shall be waived. There will be no fee charged for such onsite inspections by the city manager or designee as he may deem necessary pursuant to this section.

In the event the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional sixty-one (61) days within which to (i) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (ii) dismantle and remove the tower. The owner of the real property shall be ultimately responsible for all costs of dismantling and removal, and in the event the tower is not removed within sixty (60) days of abandonment, the city may proceed to do so and assess the costs against the real property. The lien of such assessment shall bear interest, have priority and be collectable, at the same rate and in like manner as provided for special assessments by Florida law. At the earlier of sixty-one (61) days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any special exception, or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
All towers on public lands require the posting with the city of a performance bond in an amount sufficient to ensure costs of removal prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(20)  Finished color. Communication towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall have either a galvanized finish or be painted a noncontrasting blue, gray or black finish. The color should be selected so as to minimize the equipment's visibility. 
(21)  Birds of prey nesting. New freestanding communication towers shall incorporate a design that provides an integral nesting platform to direct the most likely site for birds of prey nesting to a location on the tower which will reduce the risk of interference with tower equipment and maintenance. 
(22)  Aircraft hazard. Communication towers shall not encroach into or through an established, public or private airport approach path, as established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Each application to construct a communication tower shall include proof of application for approval from the FAA and shall be submitted with each special exception application for a communication tower. Based upon the location or height of a proposed tower, the city may require a statement of no objection from the Flagler County Airport Authority. A building permit for an approved communication tower shall not be issued until FAA approval is obtained. 
(23)  Approval required from other governmental agencies. Each special exception, or building permit application where a permitted use, for a communication tower shall include written approval or a statement of no objection from other federal, state or county agencies that regulate communication tower siting, design, and construction.

All proposed communication towers shall comply with current standards of the Federal Communications Commission for nonionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER) and electromagnetic fields (EMF). Each special exception application or site plan application for a communication tower shall include preliminary or certified documentation or a statement from a Florida-registered engineer or other professional accepted by the city, indicating compliance with these standards. The city may hire a consultant to evaluate the required NIER or EMF documentation. The fee charged by the consultant shall be paid by the applicant. In the event only a preliminary statement is submitted with the application, a final, certified statement will be provided and approved by the city prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(25)  High voltage and "No Trespassing" warning signs: 
(a)  If high voltage is necessary for the operation of the communications tower or any accessory structures, "HIGH VOLTAGE-DANGER" warning signs shall be permanently attached to the fence or wall and shall be spaced not more than forty (40) feet apart. 
(b)  "NO TRESPASSING" warning signs shall be permanently attached to the fence or wall and shall be spaced not more than forty (40) feet apart. 
(c)  The letters for the "HIGH VOLTAGE", "DANGER" and "NO TRESPASSING" warning signs shall be at least six (6) inches in height. The two (2) warning signs may be combined into one (1) sign. The warning signs shall be installed at least five (5) feet above the finished grade of the fence. 
(d)  The warning signs may be attached to freestanding poles if the content of the signs may be obstructed by landscaping. 
(26)  Equipment storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the communication tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
(27)  Leaseholds. The applicant shall submit proof that the lease between the applicant and the landlord contains a provision that the landowner is responsible for the removal of the communication facilities in the event the applicant fails to remove them upon abandonment. 
(28)  Public facilities. If the city determines that there is a governmental or public safety need, the city commission may grant specific waivers to this section in order to allow the construction of a public safety or governmental communication tower or communication antenna. 
(29)  Environmental assessments. The applicant shall submit to the city a copy of environmental statements and environmental assessments and studies when such reports are required by regional, state or federal agency. 
(30)  Reports. The owner or operator of each freestanding ground mounted communication tower or antenna shall annually submit a report to the city indicating the number of carriers or services and appearance of the facility. The annual report shall include an 8" × 10" color photograph of two (2) opposing views of the facility and a list of all antennas and equipment shelters and providers served by the facility. A copy of the renewed Federal Communications Commission license, as applicable, shall be included in the report. The report shall include a copy of the most recent structural certification from a licensed engineer and identify anticipated maintenance or modifications to the facility. The city may periodically request an annual report at other times during the year to verify the appearance and safety of the facility or to determine whether modifications have been made without city approval. 
(31)  Approval revocation. Where a special exception(s) is not met within the time set forth in the terms of approval, the approval shall be revoked effective the expiration of the time period set forth in the applicable special exception, and the structure(s) shall be deemed abandoned and must be removed within sixty (60) days thereof. 
(32)  Wiring plan. A conceptual wiring plan showing the fiberoptic lines and wires connecting the applicant's equipment and facilities together and identifying the owner of the lines and wires as well as the public property traversed shall be submitted with the tower or antenna application. Thereafter, a final wiring plan shall be submitted with building permit application. Copies of the conceptual and final wiring plans shall be provided to the city manager or his/her designee. 
Sec. 2.10.04 - Application fee. 
    For any request for a variance, or special exception to the requirements of Sections 2.10.02 or 2.10.03, the applicant shall submit an application fee at such amount as deemed sufficient and appropriate by the city, to be used to obtain technological expertise to assist city staff in evaluating the request.

ARTICLE III. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 3.00.00. - Declaration of intent and purpose. 
    The concurrency management system shall measure the potential impact of any development permit application upon the established minimum acceptable levels of service (LOS) and shall control the issuance of development orders/permits dependent upon the ability of the infrastructure (potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, roads and recreational facilities) to support the proposed development. 
Sec. 3.01.00 - Relationship of this article to the comprehensive plan. 
    This article implements the following goals, objectives and policies of the Flagler Beach Comprehensive Plan 2000: 
(1)  Future land use element: 
Objective A.1.1 
Policy A.1.1.1 
Policy A.1.1.2 
Policy A.1.1.3 
Policy A.1.1.4 
Policy A.1.1.5 
Policy A.1.1.6 
Policy A.1.1.7 
(2)  Traffic circulation element: 
Objective B.1.3 
Policy B.1.3.1 
Policy B.1.3.2 
Policy B.1.3.3 
Policy B.1.3.4 
(3)  Public facilities element: 
Policy D.1.1.1 
Objective D.1.2 
Policy D.1.2.1 
Policy D.1.2.2 
Policy D.1.4.1 
(4)  Recreation and open space element: 
Policy F.1.1.1 
Sec. 3.02.00 - Definitions. 
    Availability or available, with regard to the provision of facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of development, means that at a minimum the facilities and services will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in Rule 9J-5.0055(2), Florida Administrative Code. 
    Capital improvement means physical assets constructed or purchased to provide, improve or replace a public facility and which are large scale and high in cost. The cost of a capital improvement is generally nonrecurring and may require multiyear financing. For the purposes of this rule, physical assets which have been identified as existing or projected needs in the individual comprehensive plan elements shall be considered capital improvements. 
    Certification of concurrency is a document prepared by the office of the building official which certifies that sufficient infrastructure resources are available to meet the requirements of a proposed development. 
    Concurrency means that the necessary public facilities and services to maintain the adopted level of service standards are available when the impacts of development occur. 
    Concurrency management system means the procedures and/or process that the local government will utilize to assure that development orders and permits are not issued unless the necessary facilities and services are available concurrent with the impacts of development. 
    Development order includes building permits, approved DRIs, approved subdivision plans. 
    Impact means the effect of development on infrastructure resources. 
    Infrastructure includes potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, roads and recreational facilities. 
    Level of service (LOS) is the amount of an infrastructure resource established by the comprehensive plan as the minimum amount acceptable by the city to support citizen needs. 
Sec. 3.03.00. - Procedures for application and evaluation. 
(a)  Application. 
(1)  Application for a concurrency evaluation concurrent with a request for a land use change amendment. 
Any party requesting a change of land use must provide the city with sufficient information to determine the practicality of effecting such a change. The party making such a request must provide the following information to the city building official, on a form provided by the city and pay a fee established by resolution of the city commission which may be amended as experience dictates: 
a.  Applicant name, address and telephone number. 
b.  Owner name, address and telephone number. 
c.  General location of parcel. 
d.  Number of acres or fraction thereof. 
e.  Existing land use designation. 
f.  Proposed land use designation. 
g.  Number of units to be developed: by type. 
h.  Roads serving site. 
i.  Recreational facilities serving site. 
j.  Will site be served by central water? sewer? 
k.  Is site in one hundred-year flood zone. 
l.  Does site contain critical habitat for endangered/threatened species. 
m.  Will proposed change affect beach accessibility. 
n.  Stated reason for requested change. 
Approval of an application for a land use change amendment to the comprehensive plan does not reserve infrastructure capacity for future development. 
(2)  Application for a certificate of concurrency prior to approval of a site plan, subdivision plat or building. 
Any party requesting a certificate of concurrency in conjunction with or prior to application for site plan, subdivision plat or building permit approval, must provide the city planning and zoning director with the fourteen (14) items of information required with an application for a change of land use plus the following three (3) items of information and pay a fee prescribed by the city commission: 
a.  Legal description of the property. 
b.  Current zoning. 
c.  If potable water/sanitary sewer is to be provided by the city, the applicant must provide sufficient information for the city to determine gallon-per-day demand on city facilities to meet development requirements. 
Once a certificate of concurrency is issued for a proposed development, the development must proceed at a level consistent with the information on which the concurrency evaluation was based. If, during any stage in the development process, the applicant increases the density or intensity of the development, the certificate of concurrency will be canceled and an additional fee must be paid for the city to conduct a new concurrency evaluation and issue a new certificate of concurrency based upon the revised application. 
(b)  Criteria for concurrency evaluation. The following criteria shall be applied to determine whether levels of service available for the five (5) critical components of infrastructure (potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, recreation and roads) are adequate to support the proposed development: 
(1)  Traffic circulation (roads): 
a.  The capacity for transportation facilities shall be evaluated using Exhibit B, "Maximum Peak Hour Volume for each LOS by facility type." 
b.  The impact on the transportation network shall be determined using the trip generation standards cited in the ITE Trip Generation Manual (latest edition). 
c.  The impact of traffic generated by a development on local roads shall be evaluated for its impact on the nearest point of ingress/egress to a road designated as "the system" in the city's comprehensive plan. 
d.  The calculation of impact for purpose of issuing a certificate of concurrency shall be based upon one hundred (100) percent building of the proposed development. A certificate of concurrency may be issued for a single (or more) phase of development if the development order specifies a phased development schedule. 
(2)  Sanitary sewer: 
a.  The impact of a proposed development on the city's sanitary sewer facilities shall be calculated by first establishing available capacity which shall be determined by subtracting the currently committed capacity (those demands already on-line plus demands for which a certificate of concurrency already has been issued) from the design capacity of the treatment facilities; and second, subtracting anticipated demand of the proposed development from available capacity to determine impact. 
b.  The impact on the treatment plant shall be determined utilizing the city's LOS standard for sanitary sewer of 119 gcd. 
c.  Where septic tanks are to be utilized for sanitary sewer effluent disposal pending hook-up to the central sanitary sewer system, the Flagler County Health Services Division shall utilize the standards of Chapter 10 D-6 F.A.C. to determine acceptability of the application. The applicant shall submit a certificate from the Flagler County Health Department that certifies the site is or can be made suitable for septic tank operation before a certificate of concurrency may be issued. 
(3)  Potable water: 
a.  The impact of a proposed development on the city's potable water facilities shall be calculated in a manner as described in Section 3.03.00(b)(2)(a) for sanitary sewer determination. 
b.  The impact on the treatment plant shall be determined utilizing the city's LOS standard for potable water of 125 gcd. 
c.  Where private wells are to be utilized pending hook-up to the city's potable water system, the standards of the St. Johns River Water Management District and applicable state regulations shall apply and proof of compliance with these regulations shall be required prior to the issuance of a certificate of concurrency. 
(4)  Drainage facilities: The adequacy of drainage facilities for proposed developments shall be determined at the time of engineering review based upon the City of Flagler Beach LOS criteria for drainage as identified in the Public Facilities Element Policies D.1.2.1 and D.2.2.6. 
(5)  Recreation facilities and open space: 
a.  The adequacy of open space shall be based upon the city's open space LOS of twenty-five (25) acres per one thousand (1,000) population; developed recreational facilities shall be based upon the number and availability of recreational facilities LOS as shown in the Table F-2 of the city's comprehensive plan recreation element. 
b.  The impact of a proposed development on the city's open space or recreation LOS shall be calculated in a manner as described in Section 3.03.00(b)(2)(a) for sanitary sewer determination. 
Sec. 3.04.00. - Determination of concurrency finding. 
(a)  Schedule of availability. In order to pass the test of concurrency, components of infrastructure must be available to the proposed development in accordance with the following schedule taken from Chapter 9J-5.0055: 
(1)  9J-5.0055(2)(a). For potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage, at a minimum infrastructure must satisfy the following standards to meet the concurrency requirement: 
a.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued; or 
b.  A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur; or 
c.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a permit is issued; or 
d.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement that includes the provisions of Rules 9J-5.0055(2)(a)a.-3. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
(2)  9J-5.0055(2)(b). For open space and recreation the proposed development must satisfy the following standards to meet the concurrency requirement: 
a.  Comply with the standards defined above for potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage; or 
b.  At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the development permit; or 
c.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable agreement which requires the commencement of the actual construction of the facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development permit. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380. 
(3)  9J-0055(2)(c). For roads designated in the adopted comprehensive plan, the proposed development must meet the standards identified in subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(b)  Finding of deficiency. If the concurrency evaluation test finds that a proposed development will cause a deficiency on any public facility or service for which a LOS has been established, the city reserves the authority to take any of the following actions: 
(1)  Deny or defer the development proposal, 
(2)  Cause the development request to be modified to achieve consistency with the city's minimum LOS, or 
(3)  Process the application as a conditional development permit subject to later review and modification. 
(c)  Finding of concurrency. If the concurrency evaluation test finds the proposed development meets concurrency requirements a certificate of concurrency is issued by the building official and the request for development approval may proceed through to site plan, subdivision or building permit approval. 
Sec. 3.05.00. - Period of concurrency validation. 
(a)  Schedule of reserved resources. When a certificate of concurrency is issued, the infrastructure resources required by the proposed development are removed from the available category and placed in the reserved category of infrastructure resources. This reservation of resources is approved for a limited period in accordance with the schedule presented below: 
(1)  For a site development plan approval, the finding shall remain valid for a period not to exceed six (6) months, except where the intensiveness of the approved use on the most recent concurrency evaluation is exceeded. In the latter instances, another concurrency evaluation test shall be required. However, the validity period may be extended administratively for two (2) six-month periods upon a showing of a good faith effort to proceed. The standards for establishing a good faith effort to proceed shall be subsequently established by resolution by the city commission. 
(2)  For a residential subdivision, or phase or unit thereof, including residential subdivision phases of planned unit developments, the finding shall remain valid for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months from the date of the construction permit's approval, providing the work authorized proceeds in a timely manner as prescribed by the city commission. 
(3)  For an individual single-family lot or parcel, the finding shall remain valid for twenty-four (24) months, provided a construction building permit is obtained within that timeframe, and work authorized proceeds in a timely manner. Lots included within subdivisions which have not passed a concurrency evaluation or where the concurrency evaluation and vesting period has expired are included in this category. 
(4)  For a commercial, industrial or multifamily building permit, the finding shall remain valid for thirty-six (36) months, provided a construction building permit is obtained within that timeframe, and work authorized proceeds in a timely manner. 
(b)  Expiration of concurrency approval. Where any of the applicable timeframes, as set forth in subsections (a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) above, expire, a new concurrency evaluation shall be required with all applicable fees once again paid to the city. 
Sec. 3.06.00. - Operating procedures of the concurrency management system. 
(a)  Maintaining level of service records. The concurrency management system shall maintain a cumulative record of the level of service capacity which is (1) in use, (2) in reserve, or (3) available. This record shall be available to the public at the office of the city building official. 
(b)  Monitoring. The building official shall maintain all records of the status of infrastructure commitment. Records will be received quarterly to ensure that developments having committed use of resources remain functional and that projects having reserved use of resources are proceeding within allocated schedules. When committed resources are no longer required or when projects with reserved resources are not proceeding on schedule, these resources will be returned to the category of available resources. 
(c)  Exceptions. The following development activities are exempt from the provisions of this article: 
(1)  Construction of public transportation, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, roads, and/or recreational facilities determined by the city commission as providing for public health, safety or welfare; 
(2)  Accessory structures to established principal land uses provided the principal land use in place and functional; 
(3)  Any on-going development of regional impact or other vested development as determined by the city commission on advice of legal counsel; and 
(4)  Single-family homes on lots of record prior to the date of enactment of this article. 
(d)  Appeal and penalty. Any party aggrieved by the administrative interpretation or administrative enforcement of any section of this article may appeal the subject specification to the city commission in public hearing. 
    Any party proceeding with a development without the issuance of a certificate of concurrency shall be subject to a fine and/or requirement to demolish unapproved developed structures. 
Sec. 3.07.00. - Proportionate Fair-Share Transportation Program. 
Sec. 3.07.01. - Declaration of intent and purpose. 
    The City of Flagler Beach must comply with the Fair-Share Mitigation Statutes, F.S. § 163.3180(16), and institute a fair-share mitigation program and governing ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.02. - Findings. 
    The City of Flagler Beach finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the City of Flagler Beach Proportionate Fair-Share Program. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.03. - Applicability. 
    The Proportionate Fair-Share Program shall apply to all developments in the City of Flagler Beach that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the City of Flagler Beach Concurrency Management System (CMS), including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of Section 3.07.05 the Proportionate Fair-Share Program, does not apply to Developments of Regional Impact (DRI's) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in the City of Flagler Beach Concurrency Management System Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.04. - Definitions. 
    The City of Flagler Beach will update the Land Development Regulations at the earliest opportunity to provide for the new definition of concurrency which has been revised as follows: "transportation facilities needed to serve new development shall be in place or under actual construction within three (3) years after the local government approves a building permit or its functional equivalent that results in traffic generation" (F.S. § 163.3180(2)(c). 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.05. - General requirements. 
(l)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(a)  The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and applicable Land Development Regulations. 
(b)  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Flagler Beach Capital Improvement Element (CIE) or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the City of Flagler Beach transportation CMS. The provisions of subsection 3.07.05(2) may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the local government CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long term CMS, where the following apply: 
(a)  The city adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the appropriate city official, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this section. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten (10) years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
(b)  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Flagler Beach CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still enter into a binding Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the Comprehensive Plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system at the next annual Capital Improvements Element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways and those of the FDOT for the state highway system.

Sec. 3.07.06. - Intergovernmental coordination. 
    Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element of the City of Flagler Beach Comprehensive Plan and applicable policies in Northeast Florida Regional Council's regional plan, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.07. - Application process. 
(1)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program pursuant to the requirements of Section 3.07.05. 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) then the FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) and the following: 
(a)  Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
(b)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(c)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(d)  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
(e)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(f)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
(g)  Copy of concurrency application. 
(4)  The city manager or designee shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within ten (10) business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the Proportionate Fair-Share Program as indicated in Section 3.07.05, then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten (10) business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The city manager may, in his/her discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed sixty (60) days to cure such efficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the (SIS) requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than sixty (60) days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than fourteen (14) days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city commission meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval.

(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.08. - Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(l)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out or a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS. 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = S [[(Development Trips i )/(SV Increase i )] x Cost i ] 
Where: 
Development Trips i = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV Increase i = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per Section 3.07.05; 
Cost i = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i" Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT Work Program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one (1) of the following methods: 
(a)  An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted by two (2) percent; or 
(b)  The most recent issue of FDOT "Transportation" Costs as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT Work Program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT District. 
(5)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(6)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at one hundred (100) percent of the most recent assessed value by the Flagler County Property Appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city, and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.09. - Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against transportation impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local government's impact fee ordinance. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement as they become due per the City of Flagler Beach Impact Fee Ordinance. If the applicant's Proportionate Fair-Share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the city impact fee ordinance. 
(3)  Major projects not included within the local government's impact fee ordinance or created under subsection 3.07.05(2)(a) and (b) which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the local government's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(4)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the local impact fee ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.10. - Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement the applicant shall receive a City of Flagler Beach Certificate of Concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within eighteen (18) months of the execution of the Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the Proportionate Fair-Share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to Section 3.07.08 and adjusted accordingly. 
(3)  All developer improvements authorized under this section must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order maybe subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be non-refundable. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.11. - Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(l)  Proportionate Fair-Share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of schedule improvements in the City of Flagler Beach CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement. At the discretion of the local government, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection 3.07.05(2)(b). 
    Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an Interlocal Agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(3)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under Section 3.07.08, the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one (1) or more of the following methods: 
(a)  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution. A portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the City of Flagler Beach. 
(b)  An account may be established for the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
(c)  The city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through the payment or some contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 2006-28, § 1, 11-30-06) 
Sec. 3.07.12. - Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the city may enter an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(2)  A development application submitted to the city subject to a concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section: 
(a)  All or part of the proposed development is located within one (1) mile of the area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of an adjacent local government; and 
(b)  Using its own concurrency analysis procedures, the city concludes that additional traffic from the proposed development would use five (5) percent or more of the adopted peak hour LOS maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government (an impacted regional facility); and 
(c)  The impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by the adjacent local government, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to Section 3.07.12.(2)(a)-(c), the city shall notify the applicant and the affected local adjacent government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
(a)  The adjacent local government shall have up to ninety (90) days in which to notify the city of a proposed fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180(16). Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this section, then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair-share requirements of the city. 
(b)  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the city, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied. The city may require the adjacent local government to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant.

(C)  Intent. The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

Secs. 5.00.13-5.00.20. - Reserved. 
Sec. 5.01.00. - Coastal Zone Construction. 
Sec. 5.01.01. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the coastal construction code is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of Flagler Beach which front on the Atlantic Ocean. These standards are intended to specifically address design features which affect the structural stability of the beach, dunes, and topography of adjacent properties. The coastal construction code is site specific to the coastal building zone as defined in this article and is not applicable to other locations. 
Sec. 5.01.02. - Definitions. 
    The following terms are defined for general use in the coastal construction code: 
    Beach means the zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low waterline to the place where there is marked change in material or physiographic form, or to the line of permanent vegetation, usually the effective limit of storm waves. "Beach" is alternatively termed "shore." 
    Breakaway wall or frangible wall means a partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces, but will fail under hydrostatic, wave and run-up forces associated with the design storm surge. Under such conditions the wall shall fail in a manner such that it breaks up into components that will minimize the potential for damage to life or adjacent property. 
    Building support structure means any structure which supports floor, wall or column loads and transmits them to the foundation. The term shall include beams, grade beams or joists and includes the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles, columns or footings. 
    Coastal barrier islands means geological features which are completely surrounded by marine waters that front upon the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay or Strait of Florida and are composed of quartz sands, clays, limestone, oolite, rock, coral, coquina, sediment or other material, including soil disposal, which features lie above the line of mean high water. Mainland areas which were separated from the mainland by artificial channelization for the purpose of assisting marine commerce shall not be considered coastal barrier islands. (This definition has no application within the city limits.) 
    Coastal building zone means the area east of the Intracoastal Waterway and west of the Atlantic Ocean, with elevations as established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance rate maps. 
    Column action means the potential elastic instability in piles or columns resulting in axial or lateral bending of the member due to compressive stress. 
    Construction means the carrying out of any activity relating to any building, clearing, filling or excavation of any structure or material. When appropriate to the context, "construction" refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. 
    Dune means a mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized, lying landward of the beach and deposited by natural or artificial means. 
    Major structure includes but is not limited to residential buildings including mobile homes, commercial, institutional, industrial and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones. 
    Mean high waterline means the intersection of the tidal plane of mean high water with the shore. Mean high water is the average height of high waters over the nineteen-year period. 
State Law reference- Similar definition, F.S. § 177.27(15). 
    Minor structure includes but is not limited to pile-supported, elevated dune and beach walkover structures; beach access ramps and walkways; stairways; pile-supported, elevated viewing platforms, gazebos and boardwalks; lifeguard support stands; public and private bathhouses; sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts and other uncovered paved areas; earth retaining walls; sand fences, privacy fences, ornamental walls, ornamental garden structures, aviaries and other ornamental construction. It shall be a characteristic of minor structures that they are considered to be expendable under design wind, wave and storm forces. Such structures are also required to conform with the provisions of Section 5.01.28 et seq. 
    NGVD means National Geodetic Vertical Datum, a geodetic datum established by the National Ocean Service and frequently referred to as the 1929 Mean Sea Level Datum. 
    Nonhabitable major structure includes but it not limited to swimming pools; parking garages; pipelines; piers; canals, lakes, ditches, drainage structures and other water retention structures; water and sewage treatment plants; electrical power plants, transmission and distribution lines, transformer pads, vaults and substations; roads, bridges, streets and highways; underground storage tanks; communications buildings and towers; and flagpoles and signs over fifteen (15) feet in height. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds a cumulative total of fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either, any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places. 
Sec. 5.01.03. - Scope. 
(a)  New construction. The requirements of this coastal construction code shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone in the city: 
(1)  The new construction of, or improvement to major structures, nonhabitable major structures and minor structures as defined in this article; 
(2)  Construction which would change or alter the character of the shoreline (e.g. excavation, grading, paving). The coastal construction code does not apply to minor work in the nature of normal beach cleaning or debris removal. 
(b)  Existing structures. The requirements of this article shall not apply to existing structures, structures under construction or structures for which a valid and unexpired municipal or county building permit was issued prior to September 25, 1986. 
(c)  Construction seaward of mean high waterline. Structures or construction extending seaward of the mean high waterline which are regulated by F.S. § 161.041 (e.g. groins, jetties, moles, breakwaters, seawalls, revetments, beach nourishment, inlet dredging, etc.), are specifically exempt from the provisions of this article. In addition, the coastal construction code does not apply to piers, pipelines or outfalls which are regulated pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 161.053. 
Sec. 5.01.04. - Applications for permits. 
    Applications for building permits for all construction in the coastal building zone shall be certified by the applicant. Such certification shall state that the design plans and specifications for the construction are in compliance with the criteria established by this coastal construction code. All such certifications must bear the notarized signature of the applicant. 
Sec. 5.01.05. - References. 
    Assistance in determining the design parameters and methodologies necessary to comply with the requirements of this article may be obtained from: 
(1)  Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 4th edition, 1984.

Sec. 5.01.06. - Conflicts. 
    In the event of a conflict between this chapter and other chapters of this Code, the requirements resulting in more restrictive design shall apply. No provisions in this chapter shall be construed to permit any construction in any area prohibited by local city, county or state regulation. 
Secs. 5.01.07-5.01.20. - Reserved. 
Sec. 5.01.21. - Construction Requirements. 
Sec. 5.01.22. - Design parameters. 
    General construction within the coastal building zone shall meet the requirement of this article. All structures shall be designed so as to minimize damage to life, property and the natural environment. Assistance in determining the design parameters to minimize such damage may be found in the reference documents listed in Section 5.01.05. Building permits for major structures shall not be issued unless the applicant has provided to the city certification from the design engineer or architect that the foundation design in construction standards has taken into consideration erosion computations based on the Florida Department of Natural Resources' studies provided to the city in conjunction with the adoption of the proposed coastal construction control line; except, however, if the applicant for the building permit shall have filed with the application a certified copy of a recorded covenant and restriction, acknowledging awareness of the Florida Department of Natural Resources' studies (received by the city on October 5, 1987, as the University of Florida Storm Surge Profile for Flagler County Coastal Areas) and the recommended design in construction standards warranted thereby, and agrees that if such standards are not met, that the City of Flagler Beach, Florida, shall be held harmless from the consequences of failing to meet such construction and design standards or from any damages or liability arising from the design and construction of such major structure, such agreement to be binding on the applicant, the owners of the subject property, and all future assigns and heirs of the applicant coming into possession or ownership of the subject property, then a building permit may be issued upon certification from the design engineer or architect (who shall not have a financial interest in the subject property) that the foundation design and construction standards have taken into consideration the design parameters found in the aforesaid reference documents, except for the October 5th, University of Florida Storm Surge Profiles. 
Sec. 5.01.23. - Structural requirements for major structures. 
(a)  Foundations. All major structures shall be anchored to their foundations in such a manner as to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral displacement. Foundation design and construction shall consider all anticipated loads resulting from design storm conditions, including wave, hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads acting simultaneously with dead loads. Erosion computations for foundation design shall account for all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces, including localized scour. The erosion computations required by this paragraph do not apply landward of coastal construction control lines which have been established or updated since June 30, 1980. Upon request, the Department of Natural Resources may provide information and guidance as to those areas within the coastal building zone where the erosion and scour of a one-hundred-year storm event is applicable. 
(1)  Pile foundations shall be required for buildings located in Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance rate map "V" (velocity) zones or where impacted by wave action. 
a.  Pile dimensions, spacing and embedment shall be designed consistent with the requirements of the site, taking into account all vertical, lateral, erosion and scour-producing forces. 
b.  Piles shall be driven to a penetration which achieves adequate bearing capacity taking into consideration the anticipated loss of soil above the design grade. 
c.  In addition to the normal foundation analysis, the pile foundation analysis shall consider piles in column action, where appropriate, from the bottom of the support structure to the design grade. 
d.  Consideration shall also be given to the degree of exposure to wave attack and the resulting impact loads on lateral or diagonal bracing between piles. 
(2)  Monolithic foundations may be permitted in Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance rate map "A" or "B" zones or in locations not impacted by wave action. 
a.  Monolithic foundations may be used if soil conditions permit and if located at an elevation which minimizes their effect on the beach and adjacent properties. Due consideration shall be given to their vulnerability to erosion under design storm conditions. 
b.  If a monolithic footer foundation is used, the maximum elevation of the top of the footer is to be below the design scour depth (see Chapter 5.28, Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 4th edition, 1984) unless positive methods are provided to prevent scour. 
c.  Other types of spread footings such as running footers or pads may be permitted when positive methods are provided to prevent scour. 
d.  The intent of the above is to allow slabs on fill. 
(b)  Understructures in "V" zones. No substantial walls or partitions shall be constructed below the level of the first finished floor. This does not preclude the construction of: 
(1)  Stairways; 
(2)  Shearwalls essentially perpendicular to breaking waves; 
(3)  Shearwalls essentially parallel to breaking waves which do not exceed a maximum of twenty (20) percent of the building length; 
(4)  Wind or sand screens constructed of fabric or wire mesh; 
(5)  Light open lattice partitions with individual wooden lattice strips no greater than three-fourths-inch thick or three (3) inches wide; 
(6)  Elevator shafts; 
(7)  Breakaway or frangible walls; or 
(8)  Substantial walls constructed above the wave action and storm surge expected under design storm conditions. 
(c)  Building and floor elevations in "V" zones. The minimum elevation for the underside of the building support structure, excluding foundation, shall be above the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed on the storm surge with dynamic wave setup expected under design storm conditions. The elevation of the storm surge with dynamic wave setup shall be either the elevation established by the Florida Department of Natural Resources Coastal Construction Control Line Study or the base flood elevation for the specific area established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as determined by the design engineer. 
(d)  Erosion and design grade in "A" zones and "V" zones. The elevation of the soil surface to be used in the design of foundations, calculation of pile reactions and bearing capacities shall not be greater than that which would result from the erosion reasonably anticipated as a result of design storm conditions. Calculation of the design grade shall take into account localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Erosion computations for foundation design shall consider all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces. 
(e)  Wave force design in "V" zones. 
(1)  Calculations for wave forces resulting from design storm conditions on building foundations and superstructures may be based upon the minimum criteria and methods prescribed in the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Design Manual, NAVFAC DM-26, U.S. Department of Navy; Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Department of the Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Department of the Army Coastal Engineering Research Center's technical papers and reports; the technical and design memoranda of the Division of Beaches and Shores, Florida Department of Natural Resources; or other professionally recognized methodologies which produce equivalent design criteria. 
(2)  Breaking, broken and nonbreaking waves shall be considered as applicable. Design wave loading analysis shall consider vertical uplift pressures and all lateral pressures to include impact as well as dynamic loading and the harmonic intensification resulting from repetitive waves. 
(f)  Hydrostatic loads in "V" zones. Calculations for hydrostatic loads shall consider the maximum water pressure resulting from a fully peaked, breaking wave superimposed upon the design storm surge with dynamic wave setup. Both free and hydrostatic loads shall be considered. Hydrostatic loads which are confined shall be determined using the maximum elevation to which the confined water would freely rise if unconfined. Vertical hydrostatic loads shall be considered both vertically downward and upward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of major structures (e.g. floors, slabs, roofs, walls). Lateral hydrostatic loads shall be considered as forces acting horizontally above and below grade on vertical or inclined surfaces. Hydrostatic loads on irregular or curved geometric surfaces shall be determined by considering the separate vertical and horizontal components acting simultaneously under the distribution of the hydrostatic pressures. 
(g)  Hydrodynamic loads. Hydrodynamic loads shall consider the maximum water pressures resulting from the motion of the water mass associated with the design storm. Full intensity loading shall be applied on all structural surfaces above the design grade which would affect the flow velocities. 
(h)  Design conditions. 
(1)  Foundations for all major structures shall be designed for the horizontal and vertical pressures generated by wave forces between the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed upon the storm surge and the stable soil elevation of the site. 
(2)  All major structures, including mobile homes, shall at a minimum size be designed and constructed in accordance with section 1205 or the 1986 revisions to the 1985 Standard Building Code, as published by the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., using a fastest mile-wind velocity of one hundred ten (110) miles per hour. Horizontal wind velocity pressures shall not be less than the values given below:

where: P = pressure in pounds/square foot 
V = 140 mph 
H = height above grade in feet 
(3)  Appropriate shape factors shall be applied for resistance against overturning and uplift as required elsewhere in this code. Internal pressures on internal walls, ceilings and floors resulting from damaged windows or doors shall also be considered in the design unless the specified windows and doors have been tested by an approved testing agency and have been shown to be capable of withstanding the design pressures required in this article. 
(4)  Mobile homes conform to the Federal Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards or the Uniform Standards Code ANSI book A-119.1, pursuant to F.S. § 320.823, in addition to the other requirements contained in this article. 
Sec. 5.01.24. - Structural requirements for nonhabitable major structures. 
    Nonhabitable major structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of Section 5.01.23 on structural requirements for major structures, except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found elsewhere in this code and shall conform to minimum building codes in effect. All sewage treatment and public water supply systems shall be flood proofed to prevent infiltration of surface water anticipated under design storm conditions. Underground utilities, excluding pad transformers and vaults, shall be flood proofed to prevent infiltration of surface water expected under design storm conditions or shall otherwise be designed to function when submerged under such storm conditions. 
Sec. 5.01.25. - Structural requirements for minor structures. 
    Minor structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of Section 5.01.23 on structural requirements for major structures, except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found elsewhere in this article and the requirements of all minimum state building codes in effect. 
Sec. 5.01.26. - Location of construction. 
    Construction, except for elevated walkways, lifeguard support stands, piers, beach access ramps, gazebos and coastal or shore protection structures, shall be located a sufficient distance landward of the beach to permit natural shoreline fluctuations and to preserve dune stability. Construction, including excavation, may occur to the extent that the natural storm buffering and protection capability of the dune is not diminished. 
Sec. 5.01.27. - Public access. 
    Where the public has established an access way through private lands to lands seaward of mean high tide or waterline by prescription, prescriptive easement, or any other legal means, development or construction shall not interfere with such right of access unless a comparable alternative access way is provided. The developer shall have the right to improve, consolidate, or relocate such public access ways so long as they are: 
(1)  Of substantially similar quality and convenience to the public; 
(2)  Approved by the city, per Section 5.01.28 et seq., and approved by the Department of Natural Resources whenever improvements are involved seaward of the coastal construction control lines; and 
(3)  Consistent with the coastal management element of the local comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to F.S. § 163.3178.

Sec. 5.03.87. - Impact Fee. 
Sec. 5.03.88. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Combination accounts. Accounts that contain both residential and commercial facilities served through a common meter may be treated as nonresidential. 
    Equivalent living unit. The following is a definition of equivalent living unit (E.L.U.) 
(1)  Residential-Single-family. Each single-family residence served by the city through a single sewer service and/or water meter shall be one (1) equivalent living unit. 
(2)  Residential-Rooms, combinations of rooms, etc. Each residential room, combination of rooms, apartment, or prepared mobile home space, that includes connection points for sewer and/or water service that is owner-occupied, offered separately for rent as a rental unit, or vacant, shall be one (1) equivalent living unit. 
(3)  Nonresidential, commercial and industrial. For nonresidential uses not specifically defined elsewhere in this article, the number of equivalent living units shall be computed by the building official using the fixture unit count as defined in the following table: 
Fixture Units E.L.U. Fixture Units E.L.U.   1- 15 1  241- 340  8  16- 30 2  341- 480  9  31- 60 3  481- 620 10  61- 80 4  621- 800 11  81-100 5  801-1000 12 101-160 6 1001-1300 13 161-240 7 1301-1650 14  
For each additional increment of seven hundred fifty (750) fixture units, add one (1) E.L.U. 
    Expansion of an existing connection. If a building permit is issued for an existing connection which will increase water or sewer demand, or if a building changes from residential to nonresidential occupancy, the total number of E.L.U.'s for the old and new parts of the facility shall be computed as outlined in the definition of "equivalent living unit." The number of new E.L.U.'s shall be determined by subtracting the old E.L.U.'s from the total number of E.L.U.'s in the entire facility. The impact fee will be assessed on the number of new E.L.U.'s. As an example, if an existing building contained one hundred fifty (150) fixture units and it was expanded to three hundred (300) fixture units, the impact fee would equal (8 E.L.U.'s-6 E.L.U.'s) or 2 E.L.U.'s. 
    Sanitary sewer facilities. A sanitary sewer system includes two (2) broad categories or subsystems, which are: 
(1)  Primary systems: 
a.  Plant facilities: 
i.  Treatment plants; 
ii.  Effluent disposal facilities.

    Beneficiaries of drainage service means all developed real properties within the city, which benefit by the provision of maintenance, operation and improvements of the stormwater control system. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of adequate systems of collection. conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater, the reduction of hazard to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff, improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions and improvements to the water quality in the storm and surface water system and its receiving waters. 
    Commercial unit means any building or facility used other than as a dwelling unit or for industrial purposes and which has not been converted to equivalent dwelling units. 
    Contributors of drainage waters shall include all developed real properties within the city. 
    Developed means any property altered in appearance by removal of vegetation, grading of the ground surface and construction of a structure or impervious surface. 
    Director means the director of the stormwater utility, appointed or designated by the city manager. 
    Impervious surfaces means those hard-surfaced areas which either prevent or retard the entry of water into the soil mantle, as it entered under natural conditions prior to development, and/or cause water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from that present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas and other surfaces which similarly impact the natural infiltration or runoff patterns which existed prior to development. For the purpose of calculating the amount of impervious area, the city shall consider porous and semi-porous materials such as open paver bricks and gravel. Manufacturer and supplier information on the materials provided by the applicant/developer shall be used by the city in determining the effective reduction in impervious area. Pervious concrete, pervious asphalt, compacted shell, macadam, mortared brick and other similar materials shall be considered impervious.

Sec. 5.03.124. - Impervious surface calculation. 
(a)  All developed property, except single-family residences, in the city shall have their square footage impervious area calculated in order to establish their single-family unit equivalency. 
(b)  The city commission has determined that property not used for single-family dwellings is furnished service in proportion to the amount of the property's impervious surface and that for each two thousand forty-nine (2,049) square feet of impervious surface the property is furnished service equivalent to that furnished a single-family unit. The minimum service charge shall be that established for a single-family unit. 
(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04) 
Sec. 5.03.125. - Appeal of impervious surface calculation. 
    Any person disagreeing with the calculation of impervious surface as determined by the utility may appeal such determination to the city manager.

(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04) 
Sec. 5.03.126. - Utility fee established. 
(a)  Subject to the provisions of this article, there is hereby imposed on each and every developed lot or parcel of land within the city a stormwater utility fee. This fee is deemed reasonable and is necessary to pay for the operation, maintenance, administration and capital improvements of the existing city stormwater drainage facilities and the operation, maintenance, administration and capital improvements of such future stormwater discharge facilities as may be established within the city and to pay for the design, right-of-way acquisition and construction or reconstruction of stormwater drainage facilities to the extent that such costs have been determined to be the responsibility of developed properties and outlined in Section 5.03.129. All of the proceeds of this fee are deemed to be in payment for use of the city stormwater drainage system. Future fees shall be established by resolution of the city commission. The initial fee shall be set as four dollars ($4.00) per single-family unit. 
(b)  Monthly service charges for commercial units are based on the square footage of impervious area. The total square footage of impervious area shall be divided by two thousand forty-nine (2,049) square feet. The result shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. (Examples: 0-2,049 sq. ft equals one ERU; 2,049.1-3,073.5 sq. ft equals one ERU; 3,073.6-5,122.5 sq. ft equals two ERU; 5,122.6-7,171.5 equals three ERU, etc.) 
(c)  The utility fee for nonresidential developed property may be reduced by a credit of twenty (20) percent if the property is serviced by a privately operated and maintained stormwater management system for which a permit has been issued by the St. Johns River Water Management District ("district"), pursuant to Florida Administrative Code Chapter 40C-42. 
(1)  Initial eligibility for the credit must be demonstrated by the property owner or non-owner user by providing the director with a copy of the operation permit issued by the district, as-built construction drawings and drainage calculations of the permitted system sealed by a state registered professional engineer, and documentation that the stormwater management system meets the legal operation and maintenance entity requirements of the district. 
(2)  A credit established and granted hereunder shall be effective for a period of five (5) years. The credit may be renewed every five (5) years by submission to the director of an inspection report certified by a state registered professional engineer certifying that the stormwater management system is operating as designed and a statement of what operational maintenance has been performed on the system. Failure of the property owner or non-owner user to submit the report every five (5) years, as required herein, shall automatically result in the loss of the twenty (20) percent credit provided hereunder. 
(3)  The city manager or designee shall be responsible for verifying or disallowing any credit for on-site stormwater management system. The city manager or designee's decision shall be in writing. The decision of the city manager or designee disallowing the fee credit may be appealed to the city commission within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision. The decision of the city commission on the appeal shall be final. 
(4)  Any utility customer found by the city to be entitled to a credit under this section, who has paid any stormwater fees under protest prior to April 22, 2010, shall be entitled to a refund consistent with this section. 
(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04; Ord. No. 2010-05, § 2, 5-13-10) 
Sec. 5.03.127. - Fee collection. 
(a)  The stormwater utility fee shall be billed and collected with the monthly utility bill for those lots or parcels of land utilizing city utilities and billed and collected separately as stormwater utility fees for those lots or parcels of land and owners thereof not utilizing other city utilities. All such bills for stormwater utility fees shall be rendered monthly in accordance with Section 5.03.265, Rendering of regular monthly bills, and Section 5.03.40, Determination of billing date, and shall become due and payable in accordance with Section 5.03.35, Delinquent bills; penalty; discontinuance or disconnection of service; turn-on charge; reconnection charge, and Section 5.03.64, Payment of bills; discontinuance for nonpayment. The stormwater utility fee is part of a consolidated statement for utility customers which is generally paid by a single payment. If a partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied pro rata to each account billed on the consolidated statement in the proportion that an individual account bears to the total consolidated statement of all current charges for all accounts. The stormwater utility fee may be prorated on a customer's initial and final utility bill to reflect actual days of service. 
(b)  Any charge due hereunder which shall not be paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the city. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance (Section 5.03.35, Delinquent bills; penalty; discontinuance or disconnection of service; turn-on charge; reconnection charge.) of the city, failure of any user of city utilities within the city to pay such charges promptly when due shall subject such user to discontinuance of utility services and the city manager of the city is hereby empowered and directed to enforce this provision as to any and all delinquent users. 
(c)  All stormwater utility fees assessed pursuant to this article shall be a lien upon the property to which such fee is associated from the date such fee becomes due until such fee is paid. The owner of every building, premises, lot or house shall be obligated to pay the fee for all service provided for his premises, which obligation may be enforced by the city by action at law or suit to enforce the lien in the same manner as the foreclosure of mortgages. In the event of such action, the city shall be entitled to recover all court costs and reasonable attorney fees for such collection. In the case that a tenant in possession of any premises or buildings shall pay such charges, it shall relieve the land owner from such obligation and lien; but the city shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for the payment of such charges. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the application of this article, and the failure of any owner to learn that he purchased property against which a lien for stormwater utility fees exists shall in no way affect his responsibility for such payment. 
(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04) 
Sec. 5.03.128. - Exceptions. 
    The following land uses are exempt from stormwater utility fees: 
(1)  Public rights-of-way. 
(2)  Vacant unimproved land in its natural state. 
(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04) 
Sec. 5.03.129. - Fund management. 
(a)  All stormwater utility fees collected by the city shall be paid into an enterprise fund which is hereby created, to be known as the stormwater management fund. Such fund shall be used for the purpose of paying the cost of stormwater drainage facilities to be constructed in the various storm drainage basins and paying the costs of operation, administration and maintenance of the stormwater drainage facilities of the city. To the extent that the stormwater management fees collected are insufficient to construct the needed stormwater drainage facilities, the cost of the same may be paid from such city fund as may be determined by the city commission, but the city commission may order the reimbursement of such fund if additional fees are thereafter collected. When the fund has surplus dollars on hand in excess of current needs, the surplus dollars will be invested to return the highest yield consistent with proper safeguards. 
(b)  The fees and charges paid shall not be used for general or other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for the equitable share of the cost of accounting, management and government thereof. Other than as described above, the fees and charges shall be used solely to pay for the cost of operation, repair, maintenance, improvement, renewal, replacement, design, right-of-way acquisition, and construction of public stormwater drainage facilities and costs incidental thereto, and/or to make any debt service, reserve or other payments required by any resolution or ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds or other obligations for such purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2004-35, § 1, 12-16-04) 
Sec. 5.04.00. - Landscaping/Trees. 
Section 5.04.01 General criteria. 
A.  Emphasis shall be placed upon landscaping as a means of achieving beauty in the community. It will be required on all projects, and in some projects and areas, it will be the primary tool available. 
B.  Landscape design and planning shall be integrated with the overall area design concept and not be considered merely as an after thought. Toward this end, proposed landscaping schemes will be evaluated as to their relationship to the existing natural landscape, developed and other proposed landscape, including those on adjacent properties and street rights-of-way and the building or buildings existed and proposed. 
C.  The existing natural landscape character shall be preserved whenever possible. As an example of this, in an area containing a stand of trees, the developer should preserve as many of these trees as possible and further landscape in a complementary manner, rather than destroy the existing trees and replant with a type of vegetation foreign to the immediate natural environment. 
D.  Landscaping includes not only trees and plantings, but paving, benches, fountains, exterior lighting fixtures, fences, and any other item or exterior furniture. All items of the landscape are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value, and must complement the whole. 
E.  One (1) of the uses of landscaping will be to screen. It is the masking out or concealing of any objectionable area. The achievement of this is left to the designer, whether by walls, fences, mounds of earth, or vegetation. It must be complimentary to the whole as outlined above. Screening shall be employed in parking lots, and to mask from the public view of adjacent properties such service areas as trash and garbage areas, outside equipment of unaesthetic character, and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood. Screening of air conditioning units and other mechanical equipment shall be accomplished in a manner that does not interfere with the proper operation and/or maintenance of such equipment. 
F.  Landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impact its aesthetic character when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties. This is to include view from high rise and bridges. 
G.  All landscaping and plantings designated on the plans approved by the planning and architectural review board shall be installed in accordance with the specified height, spread and quality before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
H.  Xeriscape landscaping techniques using native vegetation shall be required landscaping for all new construction. 
I.  Plant materials used shall conform to the standards for Florida No. 1 or better as given in "Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants", Part I, Current Edition, and Part II, State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, or equal thereto. Grass sod shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. 
J.  Grass areas may be sodded, plugged, spread or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. Seed where used shall be of a variety which will produce complete coverage within ninety (90) days from sowing. Where other than solid sod or grass seed is used, nurse grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until coverage is otherwise achieved. 
K.  Installation-All landscaping shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and according to accepted good planting procedures with the quality of plant materials as described. All elements of landscaping shall be installed so as to meet all other applicable ordinances and code requirements. 
L.  Landscaped areas shall require protections from vehicular encroachment. Car stops shall be placed at least three (3) feet from the edge of such landscaped areas. Where a wheel stop or curb is utilized, the paved area between the curb/wheel stop and the end of the parking space may be omitted, provided it is landscaped in addition to the required landscaping provided. Car stops shall be located so as to prevent damage to any trees, fences, shrubs or landscaping by automobiles. 
M.  Maintenance-The owner, occupant, tenant and the respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. Landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Any dead vegetation and landscaping material shall be promptly replaced with healthy, living plantings. 
N.  All landscaped areas shall be provided with an approved irrigation system. 
O.  Drainage-Adequate drainage is the responsibility of the property owner and must be accomplished according to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and wherever possible through natural means such as grassy swales. 
P.  All landscaping materials shall be either bonded or guaranteed by the owner of the premises for a period of one (1) year after the approval or acceptance thereof by the city. 
Section 5.04.02 Criteria for parking lots and vehicular use areas. 
(A)  Parking lots and other vehicular use areas are to be designed as an aesthetic asset to a neighborhood and to the building, group of buildings, or facility they serve. A parking lot is to be considered an outside space, a transitional space which is located between the access (such as roads) and the building, group of buildings or other outside spaces, which it serves. The parking lot, because it is viewed from above as well as at eye level, should be designed accordingly. 
(B)  Parking lots, vehicular use areas, and their parked vehicles are to be effectively screened from the public view and from adjacent property and in a manner that is attractive and compatible with safety, the neighborhood, and facilities served. 
(C)  The atmosphere within the parking lot and vehicular use area is to be park-like rather than the harsh hardstand of paving. Trees are of primary importance in the landscape. They are not to be minimized in either height or quantity. The tree imparts, especially in a relatively flat area, a sense of three-dimensional space. It casts shadows that reduce the monotony of the expense of paving and creates a refuge from the tropical sun. The pavement is to be more than wall to wall asphalt. It is recommended that pavement be varied in texture or color designating lanes for automobile traffic, pedestrian walks and parking spaces. Bright colored pavement is to be used only with restraint. In order to create a pleasant atmosphere it is recommended that consideration be given to sculpture, fountains, gardens, pools and benches. Design emphasis is to be given to the entrances and exits to the lot. Trash, refuse and unaesthetic storage and mechanical equipment should be screened from the parking lot. 
(D)  Lighting is to be designed not only from the standpoint of safety and resistance to vandalism, but for visual effect. It should avoid any annoyance to the neighbors from brightness or glare. It should not impart a prison-like atmosphere. Low lights of a modest scale can be used along with feature lighting emphasizing plants, trees, barriers, entrances and exits. The fixtures are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic qualities. They are to be considered furniture of the parking lot visible both day and night. 
(E)  Minimum requirements for off-street parking and other vehicular use areas: 
(1)  All areas used for the display of parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and all land upon vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use, hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular uses," including but not limited to activities of a drive-in nature such as, filling stations, grocery and dairy stores, banks, restaurants, and the like, shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided. 
(2)  Ten (10) percent minimum of the gross parking area is to be devoted to living landscaping, which includes grass, ground cover, plants, shrubs and trees. The gross parking area is to be measured from the edge of the parking and/or driveway paving and sidewalks, extended five (5) feet in all directions, but is not to include any area enclosed by the building or covered by a building overhang. 
(3)  Perimeter screening: All parking lots and vehicular use areas shall be screened from all abutting properties and/or rights-of-way with a wall, fence, hedge or other durable landscape barrier. Any living barrier shall be established in a two-foot minimum wide planting strip. This living barrier shall be at least thirty (30) inches high at time of planting and shall attain a minimum height of three (3) feet one (1) year after planting. A non-living barrier shall be a minimum of three (3) feet high at time of installation. In addition, one (1) tree in each forty (40) linear feet or fraction thereof shall be provided in the perimeter landscape planting area. Trees referred to in this section shall be of a species common to North Central Florida and having an average mature spread of crown of greater than fifteen (15) feet and having trunk(s) which can be maintained in a clean condition over five (5) feet of clear wood. Trees having an average mature spread of crown less than fifteen (15) feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a fifteen-foot crown of spread. Trees species shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet overall height immediately after planting. Hedges, where installed, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid, visual screen thirty-six (36) inches high within a maximum of one (1) year after time of planting. The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other approved landscape treatment excluding paving. All property other than the required landscaped strip lying between the right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area shall be landscaped with at least grass or other ground cover. This shall include the off-property swale between the actual pavement of a public street or alley and the right-of-way/property line. Appropriate provisions of this section may be waived in the following situation: 
Where a proposed parking area or other vehicular use area abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier it may be used to satisfy the landscape barrier requirements of the subsection provided that said existing barrier meets all applicable standards of this ordinance and protection against vehicular encroachment is provided for hedges. 
(4)  Interior landscaping: Interior areas of parking lots shall contain planter islands located so as to best relieve the expanse of paving. A maximum of twelve (12) parking spaces in a row will be permitted without a planter island.

Section 5.05.03.02 Basic standards. 
All categories of development shall require the preparation of a stormwater management plan. Stormwater management system design shall conform with the following performance standards: 
1.  Stormwater runoff shall be subjected to best management practice prior to discharge into natural or artificial drainage systems. Best management practice shall mean a practice or combination of practices determined by the city to be the most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing the amount of pollution generated by the project to a level compatible with Florida water quality standards found in chapter 17-3, Florida Administrative Code. 
2.  No site alteration shall cause siltation of wetlands, pollution of downstream wetlands or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands. 
3.  No site alteration shall allow water to become a health hazard or contribute to the breeding of mosquitoes. 
4.  All site alteration activities shall provide for such water retention and settling structures and flow attenuation devices as may be necessary to insure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met. No site alteration shall result in any net reduction of available floodplain storage. 
5.  Design of water retention and detention structures and flow attenuation devices shall be subject to the approval of the city pursuant to the standards hereof. Detention structures shall be designed to release runoff to the downstream drainage system over a period of time so as not to exceed the capacity of the existing downstream system. The design of water retention and detention structures and flow attenuation devices shall be in compliance with the standard construction details. 
6.  In order to maintain good water quality in stormwater management detention ponds and maximize the provision of fish and wildlife habitat, stormwater management systems with permanently wet detention ponds should be designed, operated and maintained so as to resemble a natural pond to the greatest extent practicable. A natural pond design should include: a littoral zone comprised of native emergent and submersed aquatic macrophytic vegetation; a deep open water limnetic zone free of rooted emergent and submersed vegetation; and, where feasible, an upland buffer of native trees, shrubs and understory vegetation. 
7.  A positive drainage system shall be provided which will not adversely impact downstream owners or adjacent lands, including rain gutter system on the structure as needed. 
8.  Where possible, natural vegetation shall be used as a component of the drainage system. The water table should not be manipulated so as to endanger natural vegetation beneficial to water quality unless natural vegetation can be replanted and survive with a lowered water table condition. 
9.  Runoff from higher adjacent lands shall be considered and provisions for conveyance of such runoff shall be included in the drainage plan. 
10.  Runoff shall be treated to remove oil and floatable solids before discharge from the site in a manner approved by the city. 
11.  Erosion by wind or water shall be prevented by the developer throughout the construction process. 
12.  Direct discharge to class II waters is prohibited. A workable filter system approved by the city must be provided prior to any discharge to class II waters. 
13.  For the purpose of this section, it is presumed that the lowering of the water table for the purpose of constructing detention/retention basins and for the purpose of permanently protecting road construction does not conflict with the stated objectives of this section if all of the following are met: 
a.  The development site is not in an area known to the city, based on data collected and interpreted by the U.S. Geological Survey, the St. Johns River Water Management District, the city and other professional investigators, as important to recharge or to prevention of discharge to the Floridan aquifer. 
b.  The proposed lowering of the water table shall be over no more than fifteen (15) percent of the site to a depth of five (5) feet below the surface of the existing undisturbed ground, or an equivalent volume, said area to be measured at the overflow elevation of the retention areas(s). 
c.  If ditches, underdrains or similar devices are used to lower the water table, the lateral volumetric effect will be calculated, and the volume will be deducted from that allowed for retention areas. 
d.  The high water table may be lowered up to two (2) feet below the undisturbed ground in the vicinity of roads for the purpose of protecting the sub-base and base of the roadway and/or for the purpose of preventing mosquito breeding in the roadside swales. 
e.  The lowering of the water table has no adverse effect on wetlands off site vegetation as defined herein. 
f.  The lowering of the water table does not increase flows to the detriment of neighboring lands. 
14.  For project sizes greater than one (1) acre of disturbed area, the applicant shall acquire permit coverage from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program and provide proof of such to the city prior to construction. 
Section 5.05.03.03 Additional standards. 
1.  Category II development-The minimum volume of retention to be provided shall be equivalent to one (1) inch of runoff over the entire project area and two (2) inches of runoff over the entire project area if within the Mirror Lake Watershed Overlay District. For certain soil conditions or ground water table conditions which do not permit the percolation of this volume within the five days following a storm event, the city may approve detention with filtration systems in lieu of retention. 
2.  Category III development-Stormwater management plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer or landscape architect licensed in the State of Florida and shall conform to: 
a.  Category II development requirements. 
b.  The discharge hydrograph produced for the developed or redeveloped site shall not exceed, in terms of peak flow and total volume, the hydrograph produced by conditions existing before development or redevelopment for a twenty-four-hour, twenty-five-year frequency storm, if this provision will be met through detention of the difference between said volumes, said volume difference shall be released over not less than a twenty-four-hour nor greater than a seventy-two-hour period of time. Runoff rates and volumes resulting from the project, in excess of existing amounts, shall be accommodated on-site. Off-site retention may be permitted if, in the opinion of the city, the recharge requirements of this section are met. 
c.  Peak discharge one hundred-year storm. The peak discharge resulting from a twenty-four-hour, one hundred-year frequency storm on the developed or redeveloped site shall not exceed the peak discharge resulting from a one hundred-year frequency storm for existing conditions on the site for flood prone areas as determined by the city. 
d.  Runoff computations. Runoff computations shall be based on the most critical situation (rainfall duration, distribution and antecedent soil moisture condition) and conform to the methods described in the Florida Department of Transportation Drainage Manual, latest edition, and the St. Johns River Water Management District Regulation of Stormwater Management Systems. 
3.  Category IV development-City shall defer to permitting by St. Johns River Water Management District.

Sec. 7.00.00. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article [is] to promote the public health, safety and general welfare through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign regulations. No part of these regulations shall be construed to favor commercial speech over non-commercial speech, nor restrict speech on the basis of content, viewpoint or message. Also these sign regulations reduce signage conflicts, promote traffic and pedestrian safety and increase the aesthetic value and economic viability of the city by classifying and regulating the location, size, type and number of signs and related matters in a content-neutral manner. 
    These sign regulations are especially intended to reach the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and safety. The City of Flagler Beach is a coastal community located in Flagler County and encompasses several miles of waterfront property. The economic base of the city is enhanced by tourism. In order to preserve and promote the city as a desirable community in which to live, vacation and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of primary importance. These sign regulations have been prepared with the purpose of enhancing the visual environment of the city and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended to: 
A.  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; 
B.  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
C.  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
D.  Promote the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
E.  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height and excessive size (area) of signs, which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
F.  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
G.  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use and function to which they pertain; 
H.  Curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business; 
I.  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
J.  Categorize signs based upon the function that they serve and tailor the regulation of signs based upon their function;
