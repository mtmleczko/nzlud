PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the Village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, of a general and permanent nature. The ordinances contained herein constitute a republication of the 1973 Village Code together with amendments thereto through October 5, 1987. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 19 is 19-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-4 and 1-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-4.1, 1-4.2 and 1-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Robert L. Laslie, Vice President Supplements, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Sec. 4-6. - Prohibited sales and possession. 
(a)  (1)  No licensee nor any officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of such licensee shall sell, give, or deliver alcoholic liquor to any person under the age of 21 years or to any intoxicated person, except as provided below. 
(2)  No person, after purchasing or otherwise obtaining alcoholic liquor, shall sell, give, or deliver such alcoholic liquor to another person under the age of 21 years, except in the performance of a religious ceremony or service. The violation of any such provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 and not more than $300.00.

(3)  For the purpose of preventing the violation of this section, any licensee, or his agent or employee, or a representative, agent, or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State, shall refuse to sell, deliver, or serve alcoholic beverages to any person who is unable to produce adequate written evidence of identity and of the fact that he or she is over the age of 21 years, if requested by the licensee, agent, employee, or representative. 
Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or an identification card issued to a member of the Armed Forces. Proof that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent, or the representative, agent, or employee of the express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this state demanded, was shown and reasonably relied upon such written evidence in any transaction forbidden by this section is an affirmative defense in any criminal prosecution therefore or to any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license based thereon. It shall not, however, be an affirmative defense if the agent or employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent. If a false or fraudulent Illinois driver's license or Illinois identification card is presented by a person less than 21 years of age to a licensee or the licensee's agent or employee for the purpose of ordering, purchasing, attempting to purchase, or otherwise obtaining or attempting to obtain the serving of any alcoholic beverage, the law enforcement officer or agency investigating the incident shall, upon the conviction of the person who presented the fraudulent license or identification, make a report of the matter to the secretary of state on a form provided by the secretary of state. However, no agent or employee of the licensee or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this state shall be disciplined or discharged for selling or furnishing liquor to a person under 21 years of age if the agent or employee demanded and was shown, before furnishing liquor to a person under 21 years of age, adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person issued by a federal, state, county or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including but not limited to a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces. This paragraph, however, shall not apply if the agent or employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent. Any person under the age of 21 years who has any alcoholic beverage in his or her possession on any street or highway or in any public place or in any place open to the public is guilty of violating this section. The violation of any such provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 and not more than $300.00. Each day any violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense. 
a.-1  It is unlawful for any parent or guardian to permit his or her residence to be used by an invitee of the parent's child or the guardian's ward, if the invitee is under the age of 21, in a manner that constitutes a violation of this section. A parent or guardian is deemed to have permitted his or her residence to be used in violation of this section if he or she knowingly authorizes, enables, or permits such use to occur by failing to control access to either the residence or the alcoholic liquor maintained in the residence. Any person who violates this subsection a.-1 shall receive a fine of $500.00. Nothing in this subsection a.-1 shall be construed to prohibit the giving of alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years in the performance of a religious ceremony or service. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in this section whoever violates this section shall, in addition to other penalties provided for in this Act, be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. 
c.  Any person shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor where he or she knowingly permits a gathering at a residence which he or she occupies of two or more persons where any one or more of the persons is under 21 years of age and the following factors also apply: 
1.  The person occupying the residence knows that any such person under the age of 21 is in possession of or is consuming any alcoholic beverage; and 
2.  The possession or consumption of the alcohol by the person under 21 is not otherwise permitted by this Act. 
For the purposes of this subsection c. where the residence has an owner and a tenant or lessee, there is a rebuttable presumption that the residence is occupied only by the tenant or lessee. 
d.  Any person who rents a hotel or motel room from the proprietor or agent thereof for the purpose of or with the knowledge that such room shall be used for the consumption of alcoholic liquor by persons under the age of 21 years shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. 
e.  Except as otherwise provided in this Act, any person who has alcoholic liquor in his or her possession on public school district property on school days or at events on public school district property when children are present is guilty of a petty offense, unless the alcoholic liquor (i) is in the original container with the seal unbroken and is in the possession of a person who is not otherwise legally prohibited from possessing the alcoholic liquor or (ii) is in the possession of a person in or for the performance of a religious service or ceremony authorized by the school board.

    Compensatory storage. The NFIP floodway standard in 44 CFR 60.3 (d) restricts new development from obstructing the flow of water and increasing flood heights. However, this provision does not address the need to maintain flood storage. Especially in flat areas, the floodplain provides a valuable function by storing floodwaters. When fill or buildings are placed in the flood fringe, the flood storage areas are lost and flood heights will go up because there is less room for the floodwaters. This is particularly important in smaller watersheds which respond sooner to changes in the topography. One approach that may be used to address this issue is to require compensatory storage to offset any loss of flood storage capacity. Some communities adopt more restrictive standards that regulate the amount of fill or buildings that can displace floodwater in the flood fringe. Community rating system credits are available for communities that adopt compensatory storage requirements.

(1)  Determine and vary the requirements and regulations of this article in harmony with their general purpose and intent, where the appropriate entity makes written findings of fact in accordance with the standards herein after prescribed and further, find that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of requirements and regulations of this article. 
(2)  Uphold, modify or overrule the decision of the appropriate official. 
(3)  A written application for a variance from the requirements of this article or an appeal of a decision by the appropriate official, shall be filed within 30 days of the time when a reasonably prudent person should have become aware of the need or when owner, contractor, lessee, or operator was first made aware of the need for the variance or the decision of the appropriate official. The application shall fully state the grounds of the request and the facts relied upon by the applicant. Said application for a variance shall be verified by an Illinois licensed professional engineer. Each application shall be filed with the appropriate official or the building department. The appropriate official will review and transmit recommendations to the planning commission, which shall review such recommendations prior to granting or denying the variance. 
    Minutes of the hearing process shall be recorded and written findings shall be made on each of the criteria and made public for all variance decisions, and shall be filed with the village clerk. The costs of the hearing shall be born by the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-52. - Variances. 
    The Village of Bourbonnais shall not vary the requirements and regulations of this article unless evidence is presented that prove that: 
(1)  The land in question is of such shape or size or is affected by such physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations or record, that it is impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all of the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare, environment or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject property and is unique to the subject site and not generally applicable to other properties in the village. 
(3)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on each application for variance within 30 days after receipt of the application for a variance. The applicant of the variance shall notify all adjoining property owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, no later than five prior to the hearing date.

ARTICLE VII. - POST CONSTRUCTION RUNOFF CONTROL 

Sec. 12-91. - Best management practices hierarchy. 
(a)  Many developments result in the net addition of impervious area on the site. This increase of impervious surface area on a site directly affects the increase in the volume of stormwater runoff. The stormwater is unable to infiltrate into the ground and results in an overall increase in the volume of stormwater discharge from the site. The best management practices hierarchy is a process of systematically approaching the planning and design of the site with the intent to minimize the volume of stormwater discharge from the site. This may be accomplished by two basic strategies: 
(1)  Reduce the amount of impervious surface area, thereby reducing runoff; and 
(2)  Utilize the landscape to naturally filter and absorb runoff before it leaves the development site. 
(b)  In the preparation of site development plans and final engineering plans for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features that minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant should include a narrative report describing how the runoff reduction hierarchy was used in evaluating the existing conditions and developing the stormwater management plan for the site. The report shall state how each component was considered for reducing the runoff volume according to the priority explicit in the hierarchy. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include site design features that are consistent with the following hierarchy: 
(1)  Preserving regulatory floodplains, flood prone and wetland areas. 
(2)  Minimizing impervious surfaces on the property. 
(3)  Utilizing stormwater wetlands, grassed swales and vegetated filter strips infiltrating runoff on-site . 
(4)  Providing stormwater retention facilities. 
(5)  Providing wet bottom or wetland detention facilities. 
(6)  Providing dry bottom detention facilities. 
(7)  Constructing storm sewers. 
(8)  Protecting water quality through multiple uses.

ARTICLE VIII. - HYDROLOGIC DESIGN CRITERIA 

Sec. 12-101. - Release rates. 
(a)  The drainage system for new developments or redevelopments meeting the requirements of a Class 2 grading and drainage permit shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the total property under development for the two-year and 100-year, storm events. The allowable release rates for the two design storms are as follows: 
Event frequency Maximum release rate (cfs/acre) 2-year Existing Site Peak Rate 100-year Existing Site Peak Rate  
(b)  The applicant/developer shall provide analysis that proves the controlled release rate of stormwater runoff shall not exceed the existing safe capacity of the downstream channel or storm sewer system nor shall it exceed the existing peak release rate. If it is determined by the village that the downstream (receiving) storm drainage system may not safely convey the allowable release rate(s), the release rate(s) shall be lowered such that the receiving system can safely handle the detention pond discharge. The applicant may be required to provide documentation that downstream capacity is adequate to convey the peak rate of discharge at the review engineer's discretion. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-102. - Storm drainage system design and evaluation. 
(a)  The minor drainage system shall be designed to convey the ten-year event peak rate of stormwater runoff. The system shall convey the peak rate of flow without exceeding the open channel flow capacity of the system's storm sewer piping. The channel/swale system to convey through the development overland, from the development and all off-site tributary access. 
(b)  The major drainage system shall be designed to safely convey the 100-year event peak rate of stormwater runoff. (See section 12-107.) 
(c)  The storm drainage system shall not result in cross connections between different storm drainage systems. If found during on-site construction, a meeting shall be held with village officials and the village engineer to determine if other alternatives exist. The channel/swale system shall be designed to carry the peak rate of the 100-year critical duration storm event, assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas are fully developed and have been saturated with antecedent rainfall (AMC=4). 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-103. - Design methodologies. 
    Minor conveyance systems may be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the major drainage system for sites with a combined site and off-site tributary area up to ten acres. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in this article must be used for major drainage systems with a combined site and off-site tributary area greater than ten acres. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-104. - Positive drainage. 
    All developments must be provided an overland flow path that will convey the stormwater runoff for the 100-year critical duration storm event (assuming all storm sewers are blocked) within designated drainage easements or the public right-of-way with a freeboard of at least one foot. Overland flow paths shall be provided drainage easements unless the flow is contained in the public right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-105. - Freeboard. 
    All habitable structures shall have two-foot of freeboard during the 100-year flood event. Other structures require a one-foot freeboard. All structures are also subject to the applicable Village of Bourbonnais, State, and Federal requirements for development in special flood hazard areas. (See article VII). 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-106. - Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. 
    Runoff hydrographs shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. (Contact the village engineer for a list of currently accepted methods). 
(1)  Rainfall: 
a.  Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70 rainfall distributions. 
b.  When Huffs quartile distributions are used: 
1.  The first quartile point rainfall events shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with a duration of less than 12 hours. 
2.  The third quartile point rainfall distributions shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance systems with a duration greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. 
3.  The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. 
c.  When Huff's quartile distributions are used a critical duration analysis is required. 
d.  The SCS Type II distribution with antecedent moisture condition (AMC = 4) may be used as an alternative to Huff's quartile distributions. 
(2)  Recurrence interval. The design rainfall recurrence interval shall be set by the design application as follows: (Local, county, IDNR, or IDOT design criteria may govern.) 
Detention 2-100 years Emergency Overflow Routing 100 years Bridges 10-25-100 years Swales, Ditches, and Culverts 10-25-100 years  
    Local, IDNR, or IDOT design criteria may govern; subject to approval of appropriate official. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-107. - Use of rational method to calculate design flows. 
    Minor drainage system elements (storm sewers, inlets, gutters, etc.) may be designed using flows calculated using the rational method. Major drainage system elements serving a combined site and off-site drainage area of ten acres or less may also be designed using flows calculated using the rational method. 
(1)  Rainfall intensity: 
a.  Rainfall intensity values used when implementing the rational method shall be selected for the intensity vs. duration table found in section 12-142. 
b.  Rainfall intensity values shall be selected based on a duration equal to the calculated time of concentration. The minimum time of concentration (duration) shall be ten minutes. 
(2)  Rational method coefficient "C": 
a.  Rational method coefficients shall be selected from the table found in section 12-142 or calculated based on a weighted average of these values. 
b.  Other sources may be referenced when conditions are not adequately represented by descriptions and coefficients found in section 12-142. 
(3)  Tabulating calculations. Rational method calculations shall be tabulated in a manner similar to the example found in section 12-142. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-108. - Maintenance considerations. 
(a)  It should be noted that many BMPs require regular maintenance in order to function adequately throughout their design life. Design provisions shall be made to minimize long-term maintenance requirements. In some situations, specific BMPs may be rejected if projected maintenance requirements cannot be met by the property owner, or if the Village of Bourbonnais determines the proposed BMP is too cumbersome, requires extensive maintenance or excess cost. 
(b)  The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Use of native vegetation is strongly encouraged to reduce maintenance, increase wildlife habitat, and to provide other benefits. Wet bottom detention basins shall be provided with alternate outflows, which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal where on-site topography allows. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible. Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(c)  Long-term maintenance also shall include the routine removal of trash, debris and obstructions from the basin outlet structure. Periodic removal of accumulated sediment (e.g., from swales and settling basins) also shall be done to maintain the function and aesthetics of stormwater facilities. At a minimum, sediment shall be removed from trapping devices whenever one foot or more of sediment has accumulated in the basin bottom. Naturally landscaped areas of detention and drainage facilities shall be maintained via controlled burning every one to three years, as needed to control invasive weeds. Where controlled burning is not feasible or allowed, mowing and/or selective herbicide applications shall be performed as needed on an annual basis. All turfed areas shall be mowed on a regular basis to maintain grass height as established by the Village of Bourbonnais. 
(d)  A maintenance plan for the ongoing maintenance of all stormwater management system components, including wetlands, is required prior to plan approval. The plan shall include: 
(1)  Maintenance tasks. 
(2)  The party responsible for performing the maintenance tasks. 
(3)  Descriptions of all permanent public or private access maintenance easements and overland flow paths, and compensatory storage areas. 
(4)  A description of dedicated sources of funding for the required maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-109. - Channel modifications. 
    Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality. The proposed development activity may involve a channel modification for other purposes if it can meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Water quality and other natural functions, including aquatic life, would be improved by the modification or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
(2)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the stream, aquatic life, or body of water affected. 
(3)  Channel modifications will not result in an increase in the base flood elevation or flow velocities. If the village deems necessary, hydraulic calculations shall be provided which detail the pre- and post-development 100-year high water elevations and flow velocities. 
    Channels, modified or not, shall follow section 12-108 (Maintenance considerations) and for planning and long-term maintenance and establish a three-year short-term maintenance program to ensure proper establishment of vegetation. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-110. - Design standards.

Sec. 12-112. - Detention storage requirements. 
(a)  The design storage to be provided in the detention basin shall be based on the need to restrict the runoff from the two-year and 100-year critical duration events to the allowable release rates while providing a minimum of one vertical foot of freeboard for the 100-year event. All detention basin storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods utilizing reservoir routing (also called modified pools or level pool) or equivalent method as described by this article. 
(b)  For facilities with less than five acres of tributary area all onsite, the nomograph relating Detention Volume vs. Percent Impervious (section 12-143) shall be used to calculate the volume of site runoff storage required. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-113. - Waiver of detention requirements. 
    The requirement for stormwater detention and release rate does not apply when: 
(1)  The development is in accord with the approved site plan and is on a lot in a subdivision for which detention is otherwise provided in accordance with this article. 
(2)  The development is on a lot or parcel in a subdivision for which detention was provided and approved prior to the effective date of this article. 
(3)  The requirement for stormwater detention and release rate shall be waived by the village board when determined it is in the best interest of the jurisdiction to require fee in lieu of detention as described in section 12-34. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-114. - Culvert, road and driveway crossings. 
    Following are the special considerations required for the construction of new bridges, culvert crossings, roadway approaches or the reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culvert crossings or roadway approaches. 
(1)  A proposed new structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1-foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood event unless contained within the channel banks, or recorded easements. The evaluation must be submitted to the village engineer for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(2)  The applicant's engineer shall determine if the proposed construction is a dam as defined in 17 IL Adm. Code 3702 (Rules for "Construction and Maintenance of Dams"). If the proposed construction is so defined as a dam, an IDNR-OWR dam safety permit or a letter from IDNR-OWR stating no permit is required shall be submitted to the village engineer prior to the issuance of a grading and drainage permit. 
(3)  If the tributary watershed area is greater than one square mile, the applicant's engineer shall provide the supporting design calculations to the village before submitting to FEMA/IDNR/OWR. Upon approval from the village, a submittal shall be made to FEMA/IDNR/OWR and the village engineer provided with documentation confirming the issuance of the FEMA/IDNR/OWR permit. 
(4)  Velocity increases must be mitigated except that in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of appropriate measures. 
(5)  Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. Furthermore, exit velocity calculations shall also be required for all culvert crossings and erosion protection shall be provided where exit velocities exceed four fps. Minimum culvert size shall be 15 inches. All culverts shall be reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) and have flared end sections or headwalls. 
(6)  For modifications or replacement of existing structures on any stream serving a tributary area of 640 acres or more, the existing structure must first be evaluated in accordance with Illinois Department of Natural Resources Rules 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3700 to determine if the existing structure is a source of flood damage. If the structure is a source of flood damage, the applicant's engineer shall submit justification to allow the damage to continue and evaluate the feasibility of relieving the structure's impact. Modifications or replacement structures shall not increase flood stages compared to the existing condition for all flood events up to and including the base flood event. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-115. - Vegetated filter strips and swales. 
    To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. These BMPs shall be designed to follow criteria in the Illinois Urban Manual. Whenever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and swales comprised of native grasses and forbs before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-116. - General basin design requirements.

(2)  Detention basin storage volume shall be verified to the satisfaction of the appropriate official through as-built surveys or other means. 
(3)  Inflow, outflow and emergency overflow elevations and configurations shall be verified through as-built surveys. 
(4)  Final vegetative cover and permanent erosion control shall be inspected for completeness of cover. 
(5)  The basin will receive final approval upon fulfillment of (2), (3), and (4) above, and any and all other requirements or agreements with the jurisdiction. The anniversary date of maintenance and repair reporting will be recorded as such. 
(6)  All basins must receive final approval within 90 days of the substantial completion as determined by the village of any of the following: 
a.  The first phase (as shown on approved plans) of construction of public utilities and roadways in any approved subdivision project. Detention structures for the ultimate development area must be constructed during the first phase of the project, and approved at its completion unless otherwise agreed to by the village. The detention structures must then be maintained and repaired in conformance with this article, during future construction phases. 
b.  Parking areas, floor slabs and/or other impervious areas (as shown on approved plans, and not including sidewalks) for work on an individual lot requiring an individual permit under this article. Phased construction will be treated as in the above case. 
c.  Mass earthwork or rough grading, if no other phased construction is scheduled to be started within 180 days. 
(7)  Failure to receive final approval as required will be considered a violation of this article. 
(8)  Final approval of the basin shall not constitute acceptance by the village for dedication nor completion of this article's maintenance requirements. 
(c)  Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes, the use of infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and permeable pavement are encouraged. The Illinois Urban Manual contains criteria for the design and use of these practices. An appropriate sediment control device shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Engineering calculations demonstrating infiltration rates shall be included with the application. 
(d)  Side slopes. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than five to one (horizontal to vertical). Certain types of basins have different requirements as defined by this article. Detention basin side slopes above normal pool shall be designed with permanent erosion protection consisting of suitable vegetation or other permanent finish. Topsoil must be provided per specific basin type design criteria (see paragraph G, H, and I). Permanent erosion protection shall be aesthetically suitable to the development or existing surrounding land use. 
(e)  Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing flows in excess of 100-year event at a stage not exceeding one foot above high water level. The top of the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin shall be two-feet above high water level. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year peak inflow rate. Weirs, dams and specialized outflows shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Illinois. 
(f)  Detention basin outlet design. 
(1)  Where the outlet discharges directly to a channel, it is not necessary to consider backwater effects, however the overflow structure shall be placed at least one foot above the 100-year frequency high-water level of the channel. 
(2)  Detention basin outlets shall be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe(s) with a minimum inside diameter of 12 inches. Further restriction to flow may be provided by a restrictor placed upstream of the outlet. This shall be achieved by constructing a concrete wall within a "restrictor manhole." The orifice opening in the restrictor shall have a minimum diameter of four inches. More specialized designs shall be required when release rates require restriction that cannot be achieved by the minimum allowed four-inch diameter orifice opening). The more specialized design shall include provisions to minimize clogging and that tend to self-clean the restrictor. 
(g)  Other design requirements. 
(1)  Bubble up outlets, pumped outlets and other active control structures are prohibited. 
(2)  Temporary erosion techniques shall be used as required to ensure a full stand of cover vegetation in minimum time. 
(h)  Location requirements. 
(1)  Detention basins and their 100-year design high water shall be contained within platted lots or easements dedicated for drainage purposes. 
(2)  Detention basin lots shall have adequate access for maintenance purposes. Exceptions may be made for infill development. 
(3)  A 20-foot minimum setback shall be required from all property lines to the normal pool elevation which is considered to be the elevation of the water level at the permanent depth of the wet bottom detention area. 
(4)  A 12-foot minimum setback shall be required from all property lines to one foot above the high water level. 
(i)  Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. Stormwater runoff from upstream tributary areas to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system. Flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed. If the upstream and off-site tributary area cannot be routed around the site detention area, detailed information shall be provided by the developer's engineer demonstrating why to the village engineer for review and subsequent approval of routing the upstream and off-site area through the site's detention area. 
(j)  Upstream areas not meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this article, tributary to the applicant's property, the following steps shall be followed: 
(1)  The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his/her property using the release rates and procedures described in this article. 
(2)  Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this article, shall be identified. 
(3)  Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property area, total storage and release rates needed for the combined properties shall be computed using the release rates and procedures described in this article. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of computing storage. 
(4)  Once the necessary combined storage is computed the jurisdiction may choose to pay for over-sizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed above. If regional storage is selected by the jurisdiction, the jurisdiction will work with the applicant to implement the requirements of this article. If regional storage is rejected by the village, the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around and not through the applicant's basin whenever practicable as determined by the appropriate official. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his/her basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the provisions of on-stream detention in this article and applicable IDNR and FEMA requirements. 
(k)  Upstream areas meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this article, tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around and not through the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative as determined by the appropriate official. Storage needed for the applicant's property shall be computed as described in this article. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone. 
(l)  Early completion of detention facilities. Where detention or retention is to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program unless otherwise agreed to by the village. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant on a regular basis and before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
(m)  Farmland impacts. All detention basin construction shall examine potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address measures that will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with other relevant permitting. 
(n)  Wet bottom detention basin design. Wet bottom detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
(o)  Wet bottom basin depths. Wet bottom basins shall be at least four feet deep, excluding near-shore zones and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided, the basin depth shall be at least ten feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winterkill. 
(p)  Wet bottom basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet bottom basins shall not be steeper than ten to one horizontal to vertical from one foot below the normal pool stage. Slopes below a depth of eight feet are permitted to be two to one. Other slopes shall be no steeper than four to one. 
    Appropriate soil conditions shall be provided in this shoreline zone. First, compaction of both subsoil and topsoil shall be minimized (i.e., to less than 275 psi). Where subsoil compaction cannot be avoided, it should be disked to a depth of 6-8 inches with a chisel plow before spreading topsoil. Second, a suitable uncompacted topsoil, at a minimum thickness of one foot shall be spread to provide a suitable growing medium for aquatic plants. Coarse soils should have minimal clay content and a high organic. 
    Upper slopes of detention basins (higher than one foot above normal stage and including the upstream side of the embankment) should be no steeper than 5:1. Flatter slopes (i.e., 5:1) are preferred to enhance plant establishment and to facilitate long-term maintenance. 
(q)  Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge per section 12-104. 
(r)  Permanent pool volume. The minimum permanent pool volume in a wet bottom basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year, 24-hour event. The minimum pool depth shall be four feet. 
(s)  Wet bottom basin inlet and outlet orientation. The distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the basin providing that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on topography or other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use baffles or berms in the basin bottom to prevent short-circuiting of low flows. 
(t)  Shoreline vegetation. Water tolerant native vegetation shall be used to landscape the shorelines of wet detention facilities. The selected plants and planting methods shall conform to the soils, hydrology, and water quality conditions present in such facilities, with plants being tolerant of highly variable hydrologic conditions and degraded water quality (e.g., high turbidity and salinity content). Plant selection should conform to the guidance in the Native Plant Guide for Stream and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois (NRCS et al, 1997) which is hereby adopted by reference. 
    Native vegetation is recommended, but not required, for side slopes (higher than one foot above normal stage) of all detention facilities. 
(u)  Soil permeability. Wet bottom basin design shall include an evaluation of soil permeability. A basin liner shall be included in the design if needed to ensure water retention to normal pool elevation. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-117. - Wetland detention basin design. 
    In addition to the other requirements of this article, wetland detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Wetland basin grading. The side slopes of wetland basins (from one foot above the normal pool stage to at least one foot below the normal pool stage) and the basin bottom shall not be steeper than ten to one (horizontal to vertical). Steeper slopes are permitted in settling basins and open water zones near the basin outlet. 
Appropriate soil conditions shall be provided in this shoreline zone. First, compaction of both subsoil and topsoil shall be minimized (i.e., to less than 275 psi). Where subsoil compaction cannot be avoided, it should be worked to a depth of six to eight inches before spreading topsoil. Second, a suitable uncompacted topsoil, at a minimum thickness of one foot shall be spread to provide a suitable growing medium for aquatic plants. Coarse soils with minimal clay content and a high organic content are required. 
Upper slopes of detention basins (higher than one foot above normal stage) should be no steeper than 5:1. Flatter slopes (i.e., 5:1) are preferred to enhance plant establishment and to facilitate long-term maintenance. 
(2)  Wetland vegetation. Water tolerant native vegetation shall be used to landscape the shorelines and bottoms (nonopen water areas) of wetland detention facilities. The selected plants and planting methods shall conform to the soils, hydrology, and water quality conditions present in such facilities, with plants being tolerant of highly variable hydrologic conditions and degraded water quality (e.g., high turbidity and salinity content). Plant selection should conform to the guidance in the Native Plant Guide for Stream and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois (NRCS et al, 1997) which is hereby adopted by reference. 
    Native vegetation is recommended, but not required, for side slopes (higher than one foot above normal stage) of all detention facilities. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-118. - Dry detention basin design. 
    In addition to the other requirements of this article, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Dry basin drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom area may have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the portion of the basin bottom that may have standing water for greater than 72 hours. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. 
(2)  Minimum bottom slope. Dry bottom basins shall have one percent minimum bottom slopes or underdrain systems as approved by the village engineer. Where one percent minimum bottom slope is not possible, proper native vegetation should be considered consistent with the native plant guide. 
(3)  Soil conditions. Appropriate soil conditions shall be provided in the basin. First, compaction of both subsoil and topsoil shall be minimized (i.e., to less than 275 psi). Where subsoil compaction cannot be avoided, it should be worked to a depth of six-eight inches before spreading topsoil. Second, a suitable uncompacted topsoil, at a minimum thickness of one foot shall be spread to provide a suitable growing medium for plants. Coarse soils with minimal clay content and a high organic content are required. 
(4)  Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize re-suspension of pollutants. 
(5)  Dry basin inlet and outlet orientation. Dry basin inlet and outlet orientation shall be the same as for wet bottom detention basin. 
(6)  Temporary sediment trap. A sediment trap shall be constructed at each major inlet to a dry basin during construction. The temporary sediment trap shall be designed in accordance with criteria in the Illinois Urban Manual. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-119. - On-stream detention. 
    On-stream detention basins are discouraged but will be considered if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this article with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and 100-year, critical duration storm events from the property. 
(1)  If on-stream detention is used in watersheds larger than 200 acres, the applicant will use hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase the flood levels for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. 
(2)  Impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention shall: 
a.  Require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program utilizing best management practices for run-off and sediment reduction. This program is necessary to prevent direct discharge to the stream. 
1.  Best management practices (BMPs) for runoff reduction consistent with the hierarchy for minimization of runoff volumes and rates as defined in this article. 
2.  Two-year, 24-hour detention/sedimentation basins for all development consistent with the criteria of temporary sediment trap in the Illinois Urban Manual. 
3.  A program to control nonpoint sources at the source for prior developments constructed without appropriate stormwater BMPs. 
b.  Include a design for appropriate bank stabilization measures, based on flow velocity calculations, and a pre-sedimentation basin. 
c.  Comply with other relevant permitting and/or ordinances. 
(3)  Impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention shall not: 
a.  Prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning. 
b.  Cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat. 
c.  Involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands. 
d.  Increase base flood elevations or high water levels of any adjacent land. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-120. - Protection of wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and depressional storage areas. 
    Wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this article, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds: 
(1)  Detention in wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes or ponds. Existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modifications will maintain or improve their habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions and shall comply with other relevant permitting. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, or other depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage. 
(2)  Sediment control. The existing wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds shall be protected during construction and as further regulated in article V of this chapter. 
(3)  Alteration of drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds. Drainage patterns shall not be altered by development to direct runoff offsite to other than natural drainage outlets existing prior to development. 
(4)  Detention/sedimentation. All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the wetland, river, lake or pond. This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins and shall be maintained throughout the construction process. In addition, the BMP hierarchy defined in section 12-108 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland, river, stream, lake or pond, and as further regulated in article II and article IV of this chapter. 
(5)  Vegetated buffer strip. A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width, vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of a wetland, river, stream, lake or pond. The selected plants and planting methods shall conform to the soils, hydrology, and water quality conditions present in such facilities, with plants being tolerant of highly variable hydrologic conditions and degraded water quality (e.g., high turbidity and salinity content). Plant selection shall conform to the guidance in the native plant guide for stream and stormwater facilities in NE Illinois (NRCS et al, 1997) which is hereby adopted by reference. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-121. - Parking lot detention. 
    If allowed by the governing jurisdiction, the maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed six inches for more than four hours. Parking layout shall be designed such that handicap parking spaces are outside the design flood limits of the parking lot. All measures shall be taken to pond the stormwater runoff in the drive isles before water is allowed to be ponded in the parking stalls. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-122. - Rooftop detention. 
    Rooftop storage of excess stormwater shall be designed and constructed to meet with the village building code. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-123. - Cooperative detention. 
    The village will consider joint detention facilities developed through cooperative efforts that comply with all requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-124. - New channels and channel re-location. 
    The following items are general performance standards for streams and channels and do not excuse a development or re-development from meeting all other requirements of this article. Hydrologic design criteria for new and re-located channels shall be in accordance with section 12-109, (Channel modifications). For channel modifications with an upstream watershed exceeding 100 acres, additional information shall be provided as detailed in section 12-109. 
(1)  Natural streams and channels are to be conserved. The condition and character of "channels" vary from poor to good and from concrete ditches to natural and/or man-made streams. Streams and channels are often in a "disturbed" not "natural" condition prior to development. The methods used to maintain the channel prior to development may no longer be practical. It may be necessary to "improve" the channel to a maintainable condition. Bio-engineering "stream restoration" principals shall be used to do this (e.g. flatter, maintainable side slopes, etc.-Not armoring). 
(2)  Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation shall, where practical, be limited to one side of the channel. 
(3)  Clearing of channel vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(4)  If a stream or channel meeting the definition of waters of the United States is modified, a stream or channel mitigation plan shall be submitted to the appropriate official for review and approval. The plan shall show how the physical characteristics of the modified channel shall meet the existing channel length, cross-section, slope, sinuosity and carrying capacity of the original channel. The plan shall also re-establish vegetation within the channel modification using the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois, NRCS, et al., (as amended) as a minimum standard for the re-vegetation plan. 
(5)  All disturbed areas associated with a channel modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized immediately according to section 12-109. 
(6)  If channels are modified, an approved and effective means to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality must be installed before excavation begins and must be maintained throughout the construction period. 
(7)  New or relocated channels shall be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, shall be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(8)  Streams and channels shall be expected to withstand all events up to the base flood without increased erosion. The use of armoring of banks using bulkheads, rip-rap and other materials shall be avoided. Armoring shall only be used where erosion cannot be prevented in any other way such as use of vegetation or gradual slopes. Such armoring shall have minimal impact on other properties, and the existing land configuration. 
(9)  A minimum maintenance easement of 12 feet from top of bank is required along one side of all channels draining 20 or more acres. All drainage easements shall be accessible to vehicular equipment; however, linear accessibility for vehicular equipment is not required. 
(10)  Channel side slopes shall be stable throughout the entire length and a 5:1 = slope is to be used for channel side slopes. 
(11)  Trapezoidal or parabolic cross sections are preferred over triangular shapes. 
(12)  For vegetative channels, flow velocities within the channel should not exceed the maximum permissible velocities given in table 1 below.

2/ Annuals - use only as temporary protection until permanent vegetation is established. 
3/ Velocities allowed need to reflect depths allowed.  
(13)  Construction vehicles shall cross streams by the means of existing bridges or culverts. Where an existing crossing is not available, a temporary crossing shall be constructed in which: 
a.  The approach roads will be 0.5 feet or less above natural grade. 
b.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall. 
c.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel. 
d.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible in accordance with the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) section upon installation and again upon removal of construction crossings. 
e.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the appropriate official. 
f.  The developer's engineer shall provide supporting calculations and design plans demonstrating that a proposed temporary stream crossing will not result in increased flood elevations during the 100-year critical duration event. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-125. - Storm sewers. 
    The following items are general performance standards for storm sewers and swales and do not excuse development from meeting all other requirements of this chapter. 
(1)  The ten-year design storm shall be used as a minimum for the design of storm sewers, swales and appurtenances. See section 12-142 for sample calculations using the Rational method for storm sewer design. Storm sewers shall have a minimum diameter of 12 inches. Storm sewer design analysis shall be calculated under full flow conditions, unless prior approval from the village engineer is received for an alternate flow condition. 
(2)  Development shall not connect to sanitary sewers as an outflow for the stormwater management system. 
(3)  For agricultural drain tiles (tiles) see section 12-127. 
(4)  All storm sewers shall be located in a public road right-of-way, public utility easements, or maintenance easement of sufficient size to maintain and re-construct the sewer. 
(5)  All on-site stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from all events up to the base flood without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion shall be provided at the inlets and outlets for all pipes, transitions and paved channels. 
(6)  Swales being used as part of the stormwater management system for a development shall be located within a deed or plat restricted area of sufficient size to maintain or reconstruct the swale. 
(7)  Surface outflows onto adjoining properties shall be designed to release as sheet flow using level spreader trenches unless alternative designs are approved by the appropriate official. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-126. - Overland flow paths. 
    Overland flow paths shall convey the entire peak rate of runoff from a 100-year flood event, assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that upstream areas are fully developed. Overland flow paths are surface drainage systems, such as vegetated swales or channels, which are designed to collect flow and allow it to pass through the site without interference. Roadways may also be used as overland flow paths. An overland flow path must be provided through the entire site. The design of an overland flow path must account for the lowest opening of adjacent structures. The lowest opening into habitable structures in the vicinity of the overflow path shall be one-foot above the high water level for the 100-year event. Other structures shall be one-foot above the high water level for the 100-year event. 
    Overland flow paths can be sized using the Manning's equation, unless there is evidence that suggests that backwater effects must be considered. The "overflow elevation" is the elevation of the highwater in the overflow as computed by the Manning's equation. Overland flow paths shall be protected by a recorded covenant to prevent the construction of any obstructions that could impair its function. 
    As a general guide, ponding along flow paths should not exceed nine inches before flowing over local high points. Total depth of flow shall be limited by foundation elevation, building setback, and freeboard requirements. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-127. - Field (farm) drainage tiles. 
    The applicant shall submit a subsurface drainage inventory as required for Class 2 grading and drainage permits (see sections 12-71 through 12-75). The inventory shall locate existing farm drainage tiles by appropriate methods performed by a qualified individual. All existing drain tile lines damaged during the investigation shall be repaired. 
(1)  Information collected during the drainage investigation shall be used to design and develop a stormwater management system that is appropriate for the development and connecting tile lines on adjoining properties. 
(2)  Existing easements for any agricultural drainage systems located underneath areas that will be developed shall be preserved. If no such easement exists, an easement shall be dedicated for access and maintenance as provided for in this article. 
(3)  All agricultural drainage systems that serve upstream areas outside of the development and that are located underneath areas that will be developed shall be replaced with nonperforated conduit or otherwise protected to prevent root blockage. The existing drainage district system may remain in place with the approval of the village. 
(4)  Agricultural drainage systems that, due to development, will be located underneath streets, driveways, and other paved areas as allowed by this article, shall be replaced with conduits meeting the Village of Bourbonnais's standard specifications, as needed to prevent the collapse of the agricultural drainage conduit. 
(5)  Agricultural drainage systems shall be relocated within the development area when required by the appropriate official of the Village of Bourbonnais. Such relocation shall maintain sufficient slope and capacity to prevent sedimentation and to prevent an increase in scouring or structural damage to the conduit provided however the relocated system shall not be required to exceed the slope or capacity of the existing tile. If the system is not under the authority of a drainage district, the appropriate official of the Village of Bourbonnais shall consider the interests of those landowners who are served by the system when drainage systems are relocated. 
(6)  Field tile systems disturbed during the process of development shall be reconnected by those responsible for their disturbance unless the approved drainage plan includes provisions for these. The village shall be notified, a site meeting conducted to determine disposition, a plat of easement created for the pipe and rerouting or repair, as required by the village engineer. 
(7)  Connection of agricultural tiles to stormwater systems shall be discouraged. Where tiles are being connected to these stormwater systems or at points of ingress or egress from the development sites, observation structures or similar maintenance and inspection access structures shall be installed. 
(8)  The development design may utilize, when an easement is granted from the adjoining downstream property owner and where the existing system has adequate capacity and structural integrity, outflow locations that have an existing tile leaving the development site. A subsurface connection to the tile shall be constructed as the primary low flow outlet. A secondary surface outlet shall be designed for outflows exceeding the tile capacity and as a backup system if the downstream tile ceases to function. 
(9)  Surface outflows onto adjoining properties not into a defined channel shall be designed to release as sheet flow using level spreader trenches or alternative designs as approved by the appropriate official. 
(10)  The applicant shall notify adjoining downstream property owners in writing of any proposed stormwater facility outlet location and design. The development design shall utilize where practical and approved by the appropriate official, outflow locations that have an existing tile leaving the development site. A subsurface connection to the tile shall be constructed as a low flow outlet. A surface outlet shall be designed for the development site outflows based on the assumption the downstream tile will cease to function. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-128. - Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3)-General. 
(a)  The area disturbed shall be assumed to include the entire property area unless the applicable plans specifically exclude certain areas from disturbance. 
(b)  The owner bears the responsibility for implementation of the SWP3 and notification of all contractors and utility agencies on the site. 
(c)  SWP3's must be provided for all phases of development, including sanitary sewer construction, storm drainage system construction, waterline, street and sidewalk construction, general grading and the construction of individual homes. The Class 2 grading and drainage permit holder will not be required to provide an SWP3 for the activities of utility agencies. 
(d)  The village may use the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) system of compliance that is outlined in the bureau of design and environment (BDE) design manual. 
(e)  The subsequent owners of individual lots in a subdivision with an approved SWP3 bears the responsibility for continued implementation of the approved SWP3's for all construction activity within or related to the individual lot, excluding construction managed by utility agencies. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-129. - Requirements for utility construction. 
(a)  Utility companies shall be responsible for compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Utility companies shall develop and implement best management practices (BMPs) to prevent the discharge of pollutants on any site of utility construction within the jurisdiction. Disturbed areas shall be minimized, disturbed soil shall be managed and construction site entrances shall be managed to prevent sediment tracking. Sediment tracked onto public streets shall be removed immediately by the utility agency. 
(c)  Prior to entering a construction site, utility agencies shall obtain a copy of any SWP3's for the project from the owner. Any disturbance to BMPs resulting from utility construction shall be repaired immediately by the utility company in compliance with the SWP3. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-130. - Required documentation. 
    A Class 2 grading and drainage permit requires the execution and record maintenance of the following forms and reports (see also the Erosion Control Plan Action Matrix, NPDES Action Matrix - IDOT). The most current version of the standard forms from the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) shall be used. The approved project erosion control documents shall be kept on file at the construction site or at a nearby field office and must be made available to the general public upon request.

(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-133. - General erosion and sediment control design features. 
    The following principles shall apply to all construction undertaken under the authorization of a Class 2 grading and drainage permit. 
(1)  New development or redevelopment shall be designed to limit the potential for erosion. 
(2)  Special precautions shall be taken to protect highly erodable areas and watercourses, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other natural resources. 
(3)  Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond or wetland. Preventive measures shall reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation. 
(4)  The area of disturbance onsite at any one time shall be limited to 20 acres. An additional 20 acres (a maximum of 40 acres of disturbance at any one time) may be stripped in order to balance cut and fill onsite. No additional area may be open without permission of the administrator until the previously disturbed areas have been temporarily or permanently stabilized. All disturbed areas shall be stabilized within 14 days of final grading or when left idle for more than seven days. Maintained haul roads and the area of sediment basins, site runoff storage facilities and any permanently stabilized areas are excluded from this limitation. 
(5)  Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development. 
(6)  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance must be considered. 
(7)  Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on-site or downstream. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and functional as soon as practical during development. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with approved permanent measures within seven calendar days following the end of active disturbance or re-disturbance consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  Appropriate permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding, with nonvegetative measures as a last resort. 
b.  Areas having slopes greater than 12 percent shall be stabilized with sod, mat, or blanket in combination with seeding or equivalent. 
(9)  Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development. 
(10)  All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall be properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water. 
(11)  All construction sites shall provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
(12)  All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be maintained to function as intended until the contributing drainage area has been permanently stabilized at which time they shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-134. - Materials and construction notes. 
    Materials and construction notes for BMPs shall be at least as protective as criteria in the Illinois Urban Manual. In instances where BMPs are not included in the Illinois Urban Manual, criteria found in IDOT standard specifications or other reference manuals may be used with approval of the village. 
(Ord. No. 12-1899, § 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 12-135. - Site evaluations. 
    Use section 12-140 Stormwater inspection checklists developed by Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

(5)  Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible, or as regulated this article. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met. 
a.  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
b.  The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be stabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped. 
c.  Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed under dry conditions and fully stabilized before flow is diverted, incorporating meanders, pool and riffle sequence, and riparian planting. 
(6)  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
(7)  Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 50 feet to a roadway, drainage channel, or abandoned mine. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately surrounding the perimeter of the pile. 
(8)  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent and shall not be deposited into an abandoned mine. 
(9)  Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area.

Erosion control is important on any building site regardless of its size. Usually, principles and methods for controlling erosion and reducing off-site sedimentation are relatively simple and inexpensive. Here are four basic steps to follow when developing a building site. Also see "Erosion Control for Homebuilders" -Village of Bourbonnais Building Department. 
1. Evaluate the Site 
Inventory and evaluate the resources on the lot before building. Location of structures should be based on the lot's natural features. Identify trees that you want to save and vegetation that will remain during construction. Also identify areas where you want to limit construction traffic. Wherever possible, preserve existing vegetation to help control erosion and off-site sedimentation. 
2. Select & Install Initial Erosion/Sediment control Practices 
Determine the specific practices needed, and install them before clearing the site. Among the more commonly used practices are vegetative filter strips, silt fences, gravel drives, and inlet protection. 
3. Develop a Practice Maintenance Program 
Maintenance of all practices is essential for them to function properly. Practices should be inspected twice a week and after each rainfall event. When a problem is identified, repair or replace the practice immediately. If frequent repairs are required, another more substantial practice may need to be selected. In addition, any sediment that is tracked onto the street should be scraped and deposited in a protected area. Do not flush sediment from the street with water. 
4. Re-vegetate the Site 
Establish vegetation as soon as possible. Soils compacted by grading need to be broken up or tilled prior to vegetating or placing sod. A well maintained lot has a higher sale potential. 
I understand that I am responsible for implementing soil erosion and sediment control measures as necessary to control off-site sedimentation. It is understood that submitting this Notice of Intent for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control allows the Village of Bourbonnais -Building Department representative the right to conduct on-site observations of the site throughout the active construction phase. I will comply with the village's written and verbal recommendations regarding soil erosion and sediment control. I will attend a pre-construction meeting to review my plans for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control and will be responsible for notifying the Village of Bourbonnais -Building Department immediately if any changes occur to the plans, schedules, etc. 
I certify that the above stated information is true and correct, and by submitting this Notice of Intent to Control Erosion and Sediment, I agree that all requirements stated above will be met.

Erosion Control for Homebuilders Village of Bourbonnais  
Controlling Erosion is Easy....But Important Because 
Eroding construction sites are the leading cause of water quality problems in Illinois. For every acre under construction, about a dump truck and a half of soil washes into nearby lakes or streams. 
Problems caused by this sediment include: 
Increased Flooding - Sediment build-up lowers the flow capacity of channels causing more frequent flooding in areas that rarely of never flooded in the past. 
Water Quality Impairment - Sediment laden runoff transfers nutrients and other pollutants to downstream lakes and rivers degrading aquatic habitats and increasing costs for water treatment. 
Erosion control is important even for home sites of an acre or less. The material needed are easy to find and relatively inexpensive - straw, silt, fence, stakes, gravel, plastic tubes, and grass seed. Putting these materials to use in a straight forward process. Only a few controls are needed on most sites: 
Financial burden to taxpayers - Sediment that finds its way into streets, storm sewers, and ditches results in additional maintenance costs for local, state, and federal governments. 

Simple... but effective controls include..... 
Preserving existing trees and grasses where possible; 
Silt fence to trap sediment on the down slope sides of the lot and soil piles; 
Soil piles located away from any road or waterways; 
Gravel drive used by all vehicles to limit tracking of mud onto streets; 
Cleanup of sediment carried off-site by vehicles or storms; 
Downspout extenders to prevent erosion from roof runoff; 
Re-vegetating the site as soon as possible. 

WARNING - Extra measures may be needed if your site: 
? Is within 300 feet of a stream or wetland 
? Is within 1000 feet of a lake 
? Has a waterway or ditch 
? Is steep (slope of 12% or more) 
? Received runoff from 10,000 sq. ft. or more of adjacent land 
? Has more than an acre of disturbed ground 
The fact sheet includes the diagram and step-by-step instructions needed by builders on most home sites. Additional controls may be needed for sites that have steep slopes, are adjacent to lakes and streams, receive a lot of runoff from adjacent land, or are larger than an acre. 
Portions of this document were obtained from a publication by the Henry County Soil and Water Conservation District 
SILT FENCES 
Put up before any other work is done. Install on down slope enough to allow water to pond behind fence. Excavate a 6 inches wide by 6 inches deep trench along the contour of the slope. An additional 6 inches of fabric should extend along the bottom of the trench in the upslope direction. Inspect and repair once a week and after every 1/2 inch rain. Remove sediment if deposits reach one third the fence height. Maintain until a lawn is established, then remove. 
SOIL PILES 
Locate away from any down slope street, driveway, stream, lake, wetland, ditch or drainage way. Place a silt fence around all stockpiles. Temporary seeding such as annual rye or winter wheat, is recommend for piles during fall construction season. 
STABILIZED CONSTRUCTION ENTRANCE 
Install a single access "gravel drive" using 2-3 inch aggregate. Lay stone 6 inches deep, at least as wide as the ingress and egress (14 ft. minimum, and extend from the foundation to the street (30 ft. minimum). Use to prevent tracking mud onto the road by all vehicles. Maintain throughout construction. 
SEDIMENT CLEANUP 
By the end of each work day, sweep or scrape up soil tracked onto the road. By the end of the next work day after a storm clean up the soil washed off-site. 
DOWNSPOUT EXTENDERS 
Not required, but highly recommended. Install as soon as gutters and downspouts are complete to prevent erosion from roof runoff. Use plastic drainage pipe to route water to a grassed or paved area. Maintain until a lawn is established. 
STORM SEWER INLET PROTECTION 
Protect on-site storm sewer inlets with silt fences or equivalent measures. Inspect, repair and remove sediment deposits after every storm. 
PRESERVE EXISTING VEGETATION 
Wherever possible, preserve existing trees, shrubs and other vegetation. To prevent root damage, do not grade, place soil piles, or park vehicles near trees marked for preservation. Place plastic mesh or snow fence barriers around trees to protect the area below their branches. 
SEEDING AND MULCHING 
Spread 4-6 inches of topsoil. Fertilize and lime if needed according to soil test, or apply 25 lbs per 1000 square feet of 12-12-12-fertilizer. Seed with an appropriate mix for the site (see table on back page). Rake lightly to cover seed with 1/4 inch of soil - roll lightly. Mulch with straw (90 lbs per 1000 sq. ft.) 
Anchor mulch by punching into the soil, watering or by using netting or other measures on steep slopes. Water gently every day or two to keep soil moist. Less watering is needed once grass is 2 inches tall. Add maintenance fertilizer annually in split application as needed for seeding. 
SODDING 
Spread 4 to 6 inches of topsoil. Fertilize and lime if needed according to soil test (or apply 10 lb./1,000 sq. ft. of 10-10-10 fertilizer). Lightly water the soil. Lay sod. Tamp or roll lightly. On slopes, lay sod starting at the bottom and work toward the top, laying in a brickwork pattern. Peg each piece down in several places. Initial watering should wet soil 4 inches deep below sod (or until water stands 1 inch deep in a straight-sided container). Then water lightly every day or two to keep soil moist but not saturated for 2 weeks. Generally, the best times to sod or seed are early spring (April 1 - May 15) or fall (Aug. 1 - Sept. 15). Add maintenance fertilizer annually in split application as needed for sod. 
If construction is completed after September 15, final seeding should be delayed. Sod may be laid until November 15. Temporary seed (such as rye or winter wheat) may be planted until November 1 S. Mulch or matting may be applied after November 15, if weather permits. Silt fences must be maintained until final seeding or sodding is completed in spring (by June 1).

MULCHING - Used to provide temporary erosion protection 
Shape and grade as required, while removing all rocks, clods and debris. Spread mulch uniformly at a rate of 90 lbs. per 1,000 square feet of bare ground. No more than 25% of ground should be visible. 
Anchor mulch immediately, using one of the following ways: 
·  Staple degradable plastic, polyester or paper netting over mulch, with a 4-6 inch overlap at edges, installed according to manufacturer's recommendations; 
·  Crimp or punch mulch into soil 2-4 inches by using either a mulch anchoring tool or farm disk operating on the contour of the slope OR by cleating with dozer tracks operating up and down slopes (to prevent tracks forming gullies); 
·  Apply synthetic tackifier, binder or soil stabilizer according to manufacturer's recommendations. 
Maintain adequate coverage by checking after rain events and reapplying when needed. Continue inspections and maintenance until permanent vegetation is established.

(Ord. No. 78-334, 1-16-78) 
Sec. 12-172. - Conflicting laws. 
    All ordinances or parts in conflict with this article are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed and shall have no future application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any violations of such repealed ordinances or parts of ordinances which occurred prior to the effective date of this article may be prosecuted in the manner permitted by law. In case of conflicting requirements the most restrictive shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 78-334, 1-16-78) 
Sec. 12-173. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this article the following definitions are adopted: 
    Base flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood. 
    Base flood elevation. The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the base flood. 
    Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, construction of or substantial improvements to buildings or other structures, the placement of mobile homes, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations. 
    Flooding [Flood] or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Mobile home. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For the purpose of this article it does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. 
    Municipality. The Village of Bourbonnais, Illinois. 
    Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

Crane, Inc., and published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration, is hereby adopted for the purpose of this article and filed in the office of the village clerk. The flood insurance study includes the flood boundary and floodway map which delineates A zones as areas that are susceptible to the base flood, and delineates the floodway, which is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas required to store and convey the flood water of the base flood with no significant increase in the height of the base flood. The flood insurance study data shall take precedence over other base flood elevation data for the purpose of this article. 
(Ord. No. 78-334, 1-16-78) 
Sec. 12-175. - Permit required. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to commence any construction, substantial improvement, subdivision of land, placement of mobile homes, or other substantial development in areas located in an A zone without first obtaining a permit from the building officer. No permit shall be required for normal agricultural pursuits such as the tilling of soil, plowing, or cultivating, nor for such similar landscaping activities which will, when taken whole, not increase the base flood elevation. The building officer shall not issue such permit for any construction, substantial improvement, or other substantial development that does not comply with the provisions of this article or that has been denied a permit required by the federal or state law including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
Sec. 12-176. - Application for permit. 
(a)  Within areas designated as A zones each application for development shall be accompanied by elevations, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest habitable floor measured at the top of the floor, including basement, and in the case of floodproofed structures, the elevation to which it will be floodproofed.

a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall comply with the meaning of the circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or green straight-through arrow indication as if it were shown alone, except that such vehicular traffic may cautiously enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the green turn arrow.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions within this chapter, and consistent with the terms and conditions of 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1.5, no property shall be considered a chronic nuisance if the police investigations described arise from calls for assistance from any victim of domestic abuse or person with a disability.

DIVISION 2. - ABATEMENT PROCEDURES 

Sec. 20-36. - Action to abate. 
    The corporate counsel of the village or the state's attorney of Kankakee County may commence an action to abate public nuisances as described above. Upon being satisfied by affidavits, or other sworn evidence, that an alleged public nuisance exists, the court may without notice or bond enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining such nuisance and may enter an order restraining any defendant from removing or interfering with all property used in connection with the public nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 98-1145, § 2, 4-6-98) 
Sec. 20-37. - Procedure. 
(a)  When the chief of police of the village receives two or more police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a property, the chief of police shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe criminal acts. Upon such findings, the chief may: 
(1)  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
a.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
b.  A statement that the chief of police has information that the property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist or that have occurred. The chief of police shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities leading to the violation; 
c.  Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police within ten days to discuss the nuisance activities. 
(b)  After complying with the notification procedures described herein when the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall: 
(1)  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
a.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
b.  A statement that the chief of police has determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance activities leading to his or her findings; 
c.  Demand that the person in charge respond within ten days to the chief of police and propose a course of action that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities leading to the violation; 
d.  Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place that is likely to give the person in charge notice of the determination by the chief of police; 
e.  A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons are different from the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid; 
f.  A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of police; 
g.  The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this article. 
(2)  If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by the village, pursuant to this article, a person in charge stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a period of not less than ten nor more than 30 days, except in the case of a nuisance activity under section 3 (b)(7), [subsection 20-27(a)(7)] where a search warrant was executed at the property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within 30 days, the chief of police shall request authorization for the corporate counsel to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance; 
(3)  Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the chief of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other documentation which supports legal proceedings to the corporate counsel. 
(c)  When a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the exclusion of any evidence that is otherwise admissible or offered for any other purpose. 
(Ord. No. 98-1145, § 2, 4-6-98) 
Sec. 20-38. - Commencement of action, burden of proof. 
(a)  In an action seeking closure of the chronic nuisance property, the village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(b)  It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care of diligence, determine that the property had become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading of the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(c)  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any of the following factors if they need be found appropriate, and shall site those found applicable: 
(1)  The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to mitigate or correct the problem at the property; 
(2)  Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous; 
(3)  The magnitude or gravity of the problem; 
(4)  The cooperation of the person in charge with the village; 
(5)  The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(Ord. No. 98-1145, § 2, 4-6-98) 
Sec. 20-39. - Emergency closing procedures. 
(a)  In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for such interim relief, as is deemed by the chief of police to be appropriate. In such an event, the notification provision set forth in section 20-29 above need not be complied with, however, the village shall make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing. 
(b)  In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a chronic nuisance property as defined in this section 20-31 [section 20-27], the court may order the remedy set out above. In addition, in the event that it also finds the person in charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating this article and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as provided above. 
(c)  The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property against use of occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If used herein, costs mean these costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the property, as well as, tenant relocation costs. 
(d)  The company affecting the closure shall prepare a statement of cost and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
(e)  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the village. 
(f)  A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into the property, after either: 
(1)  The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the chief of police's determination as described above. 
(2)  Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought pursuant to this section. 
(3)  Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.

(Ord. No. 06-1574, § 1, 6-12-06) 
Sec. 30-9. - Design standards. 
(a)  Streets. 
(1)  All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(2)  Where such is not shown on the general development plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
a.  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
b.  Conform to a plan for the area or neighborhood approved or adopted by the plan commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(3)  Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(4)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed highway or primary thoroughfare, as shown on the general development plan, the plan commission may require marginal access streets; reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation, at least ten feet wide, along the rear property line; deep lots with rear service alleys; or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(5)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or highway, the plan commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such railroad or highway, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(6)  Reserve strips controlling access to streets or alleys shall be prohibited. 
(7)  All street intersections and confluences should encourage safe traffic flow. 
(8)  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
(9)  Tangents shall be introduced between reverse horizontal curves on all streets (see "Minimum Standards for Street Design" herein). 
(10)  When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure clear sight distances (see "Minimum Standards for Street Design" herein). 
(11)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60 degrees. 
(12)  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius as specified in "Minimum Standards for Street Design" herein. The plan commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded corners. 
(13)  Street right-of-way widths shall be as specified in "Minimum Standards for Street Design" herein. 
(14)  Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the plan commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(15)  Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs), designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than 500 feet from the intersection of the origin through the center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside pavement diameter of at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 112 feet. 
(16)  No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be projected wherever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the plan commission. 
(17)  Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in "Minimum Standards for Street Design" herein. 
(18)  Street grades shall provide proper relation between the street and the first floor elevation of the houses or buildings and permit convenient and economical access to and drainage of the lots. 
(19)  In addition to meeting these minimum design standards, all roadways shall meet or exceed AASHTO standards.

(b)  Alleys. 
(1)  Alleys shall be provided in commercial, business, and industrial districts, except that the plan commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
(2)  Alleys in residential areas shall not be permitted, except where deemed necessary and on the recommendation of the plan commission. 
(3)  The width of an alley, where permitted, shall be 30 feet. 
(4)  Alley intersections and sharp changes in alley alignment shall be avoided, but, where necessary, corners may be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(5)  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as determined by the plan commission. 
(c)  Easements. 
(1)  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 12 feet wide, except easements dedicated solely as street light easements which may be eight feet wide. 
(2)  Easements shall be designed to provide continuity from block to block. 
(3)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such water course and shall include such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and as determined by the village engineer. A minimum of ten feet shall be provided on either side of the ditch measured from the top of the bank away from the centerline of the drainageway. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. 
(d)  Blocks. 
(1)  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
b.  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions within the corporate limits of the village. 
c.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(2)  Block lengths shall not exceed 1,500 feet, or be less than 600 feet. 
(3)  Pedestrian crosswalk right-of-ways not less than ten feet wide shall be required where deemed necessary by the plan commission to provide for pedestrian circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities. 
(4)  Blocks or portions thereof intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designated as such, and the plan shall show adequate off-street areas to provide for parking, loading docks, and other such facilities. 
(e)  Lots. 
(1)  The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. 
(2)  Lot dimensions and areas shall conform to the requirements of the Bourbonnais Zoning Ordinance where applicable, but in no case shall a lot for residential purposes in a new subdivision be less than 50 feet wide at the building line, nor less than 6,000 square feet in area. However: 
a.  Residential lots where not served by public sanitary sewers and water supply shall be not less than 100 feet wide at the building line nor less than 20,000 square feet in area. Where either public sanitary sewers or water supply is provided, a lot shall be not less than 80 feet wide nor less than 10,000 square feet in area or as outlined by the county health department. 
b.  Where unusual soil conditions or other physical factors exist which may impair the health and safety of the residents of the neighborhood in which a or the Kankakee County Public Health Department, the plan commission may increase lot area requirements as may be necessary. 
c.  Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site and to afford the minimum usable area required in this chapter or the Bourbonnais zoning ordinance for front, rear, and side yards. 
d.  Depths and widths of lots or properties reserved or laid out for commercial, business, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required in the Bourbonnais Zoning Ordinance. 
(3)  Corner lots for residential use shall have a minimum of ten percent extra width to permit appropriate building setback from and to permit appropriate orientation to both streets on which they abut. 
(4)  All lots shall abut on a publicly-dedicated street and/or an easement dedicated for a roadway. 
(5)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from highways or primary thoroughfares or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such highways and primary thoroughfares or other disadvantageous use. 
(6)  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(f)  Building setback lines. Building setback lines in residential areas of new subdivisions shall conform to the front yard provisions of the Bourbonnais Zoning Ordinance, except that in no case shall the building setback line be less than 25 feet from the front property line. A corner lot shall maintain not less than the minimum building setback lines required on both streets on which the lot abuts. 
(g)  Parks, schools, and public areas. As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a final plat of resubdivision or of a final development plan (including a planned unit development), each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land and donate money for public park and recreational uses to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village in accordance with the following criteria and formulae: 
(1)  Criteria for requiring park and recreational land dedication and cash payments. 
a.  Requirements and population ratio. The ultimate population of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be ten acres of land per thousand of ultimate population in a subdivision or planned unit development, plus the sum of cash per dwelling unit as outlined in "appendix exhibit C". (Appendix exhibit C is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the village clerk). 
In the event the ultimate population of a subdivision or planned unit development will be less than or greater than 1,000 persons, the amount of land required for dedication will be determined by using the ratio of six acres per 1,000 population as the determining standard. (See appendix exhibit C.) 
The money contribution shall be used by the village for park land acquisition, park site preparation and construction, equipment and other related improvement costs. 
b.  Location. A location which will serve the entire development is most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the development. 
c.  Retention requirements. Land dedication required by this chapter may include land required for drainage or retention purposes pending approval of the village engineer, park board and plan commission. 
d.  Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for private use, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public land service. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the board of trustees be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the board of trustees based upon the needs of the estimated population and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. 
In general, a substitution of "private" open space for park and recreation land will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the board of trustees, and before any credit is given for "private" open space areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee in form satisfactory to the board of trustees, that those "private" open space areas will be permanently maintained for such use. Private "swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When an adjustment for "private" open space areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park and recreation land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(2)  Criteria for requiring a contribution to cash in lieu of park and recreation land. Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational land use, or when land for park and recreation use cannot be made contiguous to existing or proposed sites as designated by the village master plan, the village, upon recommendation of the board of trustees shall require the subdivider or developer to pay cash contributions in lieu of the land dedication that would have been required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation use shall be held in trust by the village solely for the acquisition of land for parks and recreation which will be available to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing park and recreation facilities within the village which already serve such needs. It shall be the policy of the village to use its best efforts to use the cash contributions in the general area of the development for which they were contributed. 
a.  Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated for park and recreation purposes. It has been determined that fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is as follows: 
$25,000.00 per acre; 
and the applicable figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto with the board of trustees. 
In the event of any such objection, the subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of in his development or other evidence thereof and a final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the board of trustees based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be obtained by the board of trustees, the village park board, or others. The fair market value shall be reviewed and adjusted annually commencing one year after the adoption of this chapter. The board of trustees will review fair market value annually to accurately reflect land value within the village and within the planning jurisdiction of the village. In the event that the board of trustees fails to review and adjust the fair market value on an annual basis, such value shall automatically increase at a rate of the assessed value of land per annum commencing on each anniversary of adoption of this chapter. In any event, if the board of trustees fails to review and adjust the fair market value on an annual basis, such failure shall not be deemed to invalidate this chapter, or any parts thereof.

Notes: 
1.  Developers are required to donate land for each unit to be constructed. 
2.  This donation will be made in either actual acreage per the schedule in column A or as cash in lieu of land per the schedule in column B, or as a combination thereof, as determined by the village board. 
3.  Developers are also required to contribute for equipment and site development, as outlined in schedule in column C. 
(3)  Criteria for requiring dedication and a contribution. There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
a.  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for land for park and recreation use. That portion of the land within the subdivision or planned unit development falling within the park and recreational use location shall be dedicated as a site, as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 
b.  A major part of the local park and recreation land has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to complete the site. The small portion shall be dedicated and a cash contribution shall be required in lieu of any additional land that would have been required for dedication. 
(4)  Density formula. A document entitled "Population Per Unit-Naperville, Illinois", prepared by Associated Municipal Consultants Inc., is attached as "appendix exhibit C" and incorporated herein by reference. Such table is generally indicative of current and short-range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres and land or cash contribution thereof. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over period of time; therefore, the table shall be updated every two years, if deemed necessary in the opinion of the board of trustees, after passage of this chapter, to reflect the latest table published by Associated Municipal Consultants or any comparably reliable source. If the board of trustees fails to renew said table and update same, such failure shall not be deemed to invalidate this chapter or any parts thereof. A subdivider or developer may file with the board of trustees a written objection to the table listed herein. In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to such table, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event a determination of the density formula to be used in calculating the dedication or contribution required herein shall be made by the board of trustees after review of such demographic information. 
(5)  Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan or the designation by the village calls for a larger amount of land for park or recreational use in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the subdivider or developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider's or developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase (or condemnation) by the village in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Municipal Code. 
(6)  Combining with adjoining developments. Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than 40 acres, park and recreation lands which are to be dedicated should be, where possible, and in the best interests of the village, combined with dedications from the adjoining developments in order to produce usable park lands and thereby minimize the hardship on a particular subdivider or developer. 
(7)  Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose. A subdivider or developer shall allow the village to have access to proposed sites for the purpose of conducting soil boring tests. 
(8)  Combining park and recreation land and land for a school site. Wherever possible, and whenever in the best interests of the village and the effected school district, land dedication for park and recreation sites shall be contiguous to land dedicated for a school site. 
(9)  Time of conveyance or payment. 
a.  Conveyance. A subdivider or developer shall convey to the village the land required under this chapter at the time of final approval by the board of trustees of the subdivision or resubdivision plat, or final development plan by the delivery of the following documents: 
1.  A good and sufficient trustee's or warranty deed conveying fee simple title free and clear of all encumbrances (except liens or encumbrances dischargeable by cash accompanying said deed) except for current real estate taxes; 
2.  Preliminary commitment for title insurance issued by a title insurance company acceptable to the board of trustees covering a date not more than 30 days prior to the date of conveyance in the amount of the fair market value of the land to be conveyed as established herein, subject only to the matters hereof, and to such other matters acceptable to the board of trustees; 
3.  An affidavit of title to the real estate; 
4.  Completed Illinois Department of Revenue and Kankakee County real estate declarations; 
5.  A deposit of money sufficient to cover the real estate taxes for the entire year in which the deed is delivered; and 
6.  A plat of survey containing thereon the legal description of the property to be conveyed and any other matters which may be required by the village engineer. 
b.  Payment. Cash contributions required under this chapter shall be paid as follows: 
1.  One hundred percent of the sum determined shall be paid at the time of final approval of the plat of subdivision, resubdivision or final development plan or otherwise provided to the village in the village's sole discretion by agreement between the developer and the village. 
In no event shall the balance due to the village be paid more than three years from the final approval of developer's project. 
2.  It shall be the duty of the village treasurer to establish regulations and procedures for the collection and administration of the cash contributions required under this chapter. 
(10)  Credit for land and cash or contribution of cash in lieu of land given under annexation agreements. If a subdivider or developer has given land and a contribution of money or a contribution of cash in lieu of land as part of an annexation agreement and thereafter the subdivider or developer or their successors submit a plan of subdivision or resubdivision or final development plan which will increase the density of population in those areas covered by the annexation agreement, then the subdivider or developer shall be required to make an additional contribution of park and recreation land, or of cash in lieu thereof as outlined above. The additional land or cash in lieu of land to be contributed shall be the difference between that land or cash in lieu of land required as determined from the plat of subdivision or resubdivision or final development plan and that land or cash in lieu of land previously contributed under the annexation agreement. 
(11)  Developer agreements. The village may enter into a developer agreement with any subdivider or developer which sets forth the time and manner of compliance with the terms of this chapter and implementation of any other provisions of the village's subdivision regulations. If any developer agreement has been previously entered into between the village and a subdivider and that agreement remains in full force and effect, the provisions of that agreement shall control and this chapter shall have no force and effect, provided that subdivider complies with the terms of such agreement; also, if an agreement specifies a dollar amount that the subdivider is required to pay to the village then this chapter shall have no force or effect. In all other cases, the subdivider is required to pay fees pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and the village shall utilize the fees set forth herein to determine the appropriate exaction amount, less credits, if any. Further, if the development contemplated by a subdivider or developer has increased the population density in excess of the amount previously estimated by reason of resubdivision or rezoning, then the developer agreement previously entered into between the subdivider and the village shall be amended and the subdivider or developer shall pay an additional pro-rata fee based on the fee schedule set forth in this chapter.

(DRAFT) 
I.  INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS/PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
Contractor qualifications. Contractor(s) must possess a minimum of five years experience with native prairie and wetland seed installation. Proof of successful completion of a minimum of five native wetland and prairie installation projects within the last three years with a scope that is equal or greater in complexity as the project. Each of the five projects must involve a minimum of three acres or greater of native prairie and/or wetland seed installation and 3,000 or greater live native plugs. Accompanying references are required to be submitted with the pre-qualification information. 
Installation Performance Standards Completion Schedule: 
Work Component Start Date Completion Date Preplant preparation (herbicide, mowing, raking) April 15 May 1 Native seed installation (no earlier than one week postherbicide application) May 1 June 15 Live plug installation May 1 July 1 Erosion control blanket installation May 1 June 15  
Top soil installation/preparation (requirement for excavation/mass grading contractor). This work shall consist of the furnishing and replacing of 12 inches of topsoil in the areas proposed for planting under this contract. 
At least 12 inches of topsoil shall be placed over all disturbed areas, except areas below the safety ledge of the proposed basin and areas designated for hardscape preparation. Provide a natural friable topsoil of the region, rich in organic matter, without any material toxic to plant growth and of uniform quality, free of large roots, sticks, hard clay, weeds, brush, stones over one inch in maximum dimension or other litter or waste products. Provide topsoil containing no decomposed stone, salts or alkali, and not less than 15 parts per million of available nitrates, three parts per million of available phosphorus, 15 parts per million of potash, and having a pH of not less than 6.0 nor more than 7.2 at a depth of eight inches below the surface of the field from which it is removed. Provide topsoil with a mechanical analysis as follows: 
Sieve Percentage Passing 1 inch 100 1/4-inch 97-100 No. 100 40-60  
The topsoil shall be incorporated into the subsoil by placing half of the depth, discing it in, and placing the remaining depth of soil. A soil ripping/decompaction process shall be utilized to achieve the acceptable soil compaction parameters. Soil compaction shall be measured with a penetrometer to a depth of 12 inches. 
One measurement shall be made for every 400 square feet. If readings average greater than 250 psi, then the soil shall be ripped again to a depth of 12 feet using methods approved by the site supervisor. All disturbed areas shall be covered with the required topsoil and meet the maximum compaction criteria prior to completion of the mass excavation. 
Seed stock requirement. 
Quality. All seed installed must meet a minimum of 75 percent PLS (pure live seed) per species as verified by independent laboratory test results. Test results can be no more than 12 months old. Contractor must provide verification of test results prior to install. 
Seed source. All seed must be from a verifiable source within a 150-mile radius of the project. Contractor must provide verification of seed source prior to install. 
Seeding installations with associated performance standards will include the following: 
Prescribed seed and plug installation. This work shall consist of delivery and professional installation of preapproved and designer-prescribed seeding schedules as indicated on the plans. 
Low-maintenance fescue. Plan specified area denoted as "low profile fescue" shall be finished, groomed and raked prior to seed installation so as to provide a smooth, even finish grade free from debris or irregularities. All standing vegetation shall be 100 percent killed (by aerial cover quantified by visual observation of dead or dying plant cover) via Round-Up(r) application a minimum of one week prior to installation. 
Contractor is responsible to prevent "drift" or overspray into neighboring areas not denoted as "low profile fescue" on specified plans. Prescribed seed mix shall be installed according to seed installation noted in plan. Contractor shall guarantee 80 percent aerial coverage of prescribed temporary seed crop and 20 percent aerial coverage of "native permanent" seeded species by the end of the first growing season (October 15). 
Contractor shall guarantee 45 percent aerial coverage of native "permanent" seeded species with 100 percent representation of all prescribed species by the end of the second growing season (October 15). 
Basic tall grass prairie, low profile prairie, or wet-mesic prairie. Plan specified areas, denoted as "basic tall grass prairie, low profile prairie, or wet-mesic prairie," shall be finished graded and groomed prior to seed installation. Standing vegetation shall be 100 percent killed (by aerial cover quantified by visual observation of dead or dying plant cover) via Round-Up(r) application a minimum of one week prior to installation. Contractor is responsible to prevent drift overspray into non-designated areas. Prescribed seed mix shall be installed according to seed installation notes provided in plan. 
Contractor is responsible to prevent "drift" or overspray into neighboring areas not denoted as "low profile fescue" on specified plans. Prescribed seed mix shall be installed according to seed installation noted in plan. Contractor shall guarantee 80 percent aerial coverage of prescribed temporary seed crop and 20 percent aerial coverage of "native permanent" seeded species by the end of the first growing season (October 15). 
Contractor shall guarantee 45 percent aerial coverage of native "permanent" seeded species with 100 percent representation of all prescribed species by the end of the second growing season (October 15). 
Plug installations (pond emergent, wet-mesic prairie). This work shall include deliver and installation of plan specified plant plugs within areas denoted on the owner's planting plan. Areas designated for plug planting shall be 100 percent killed (by aerial coverage quantified by visual observation) via Rodeo(r) application a minimum of one week prior to planting. All debris shall be removed prior to planting including woody debris floating at the pond edges. 
Plant plugs shall bear live, healthy, above-surface growth consisting of true leaves, not seed leaves, upon delivery. Plug containers or tray compartments shall be a minimum of two and one-quarter inch wide and four-and-one-half-inch depth with a healthy, disease-free root stock. 
Installation of plugs in "planting pods" or appropriate zones based on species will be coordinated in the field with owner's designer. Contractor is responsible and will provide for goose exclusion to prevent waterfowl herbivory of installed plugs. The owner will approve the method chosen by the contractor. 
Contractor shall guarantee 70 percent survival (by number) of all planted plugs with 100 percent representation of all prescribed species (by number) by the end of the first year following installation (July 1, 2002). 
II.  Three-year maintenance plan. The objective of this management plan is to provide requirements for maintenance activities for the various native landscaping areas installed around and within the pond during the initial three years following installation. Once this three-year mark has been reached and all plant assemblages have developed satisfactorily, a permanent site-specific maintenance plan will be developed. 
Low-maintenance fescue. 
 All fescue areas shall be inspected and policed for litter and debris prior to each mowing. 
 Mowing should occur approximately once a month to a height of four to six inches. Care should be taken to never remove more than one-third of the top growth. Fescue grasses will often produce seed-heads in mid to late spring. To maintain a more manicured lawn-like appearance, mow at four inches when seed-heads appear. 
 Fertilizer is not recommended for this turf, and should be applied sparingly if used at all. 
 Once established, water only during dry periods. Occasional, thorough soakings are preferred over frequent light sprinklings. 
 All sidewalks, curb lines, concrete slabs and planting bed edges shall be mechanically edged as needed to maintain a neat, clean appearance (approximately twice per month). Low visibility areas such as road shoulders, outlying tree circles, bed edges, etc., may be chemically contained, but at no time will there be more than one-half inch of visual desiccated plant growth along the contained areas. 
 Trimming shall be performed around all road signs, guard posts, trees, shrubs, utility poles and other obstacles paying special care to not damage trees and shrubs. The grass to be trimmed shall not be trimmed to less than the desired height of cut determined by the mowing operation. 
Natural areas maintenance. Maintenance for the prairie and emergent wetland areas will be the same for the first three years, due to the fact that all of these areas have closely related plant assemblages and will all consistently in the same stage of development as one another. For prevention and control of particular non-native species, please refer to the attached Vegetation Management Guidelines (appendix A). These guidelines detail appropriate methods of control for many of the most common offensive species. 
Maintenance for these three areas will be as follows: 
Year 1 (same year as initial installation). 
Spot herbicide control. Trained applicators shall police entire site to identify and control aggressive non-native and invasive species. Applications will be as needed and should be according to recommendations found in the attached vegetation control guidelines. 
Site mowing. Bushog-style mower should be used to mow all accessible areas to a height of six inches to prevent encroachment of woody species. Areas too wet for mechanical equipment to access will be avoided. Two mowing events should occur each year; one in late May/early June and one in early November. 
Year 2. 
Spot herbicide control. Same as Year 1. 
Site mowing. Initial site mowing should be completed in late May/early June. If sufficient fuel load has developed to conduct a fall prescribed burn, then burning should take place in lieu of the November mowing event. If sufficient fuel load does not exist, then site should be mowed a second time in November. 
Enhancement plantings. Installation of supplemental live plugs will occur in June. Planting will be performed by qualified contractors as defined under specifications. 
Possible supplemental reseeding. By late in the growing season of Year 1, an accurate assessment of the success of the initial native seeding will be possible. If the plant communities are not developing to a level commensurate with the expectations of both the owner and their restoration consultant, re-seeding will be required. The species to be reseeded will either be identical to the original species list or will be selected by a qualified restoration consultant for suitability to the most current site conditions. 
Possible prescribed burning. If sufficient fuel load has developed, the owner shall enlist the services of a trained and experienced prescribed burn contractor to perform a prescribed burn of the prairie and wetland areas of the site. If weather conditions allow, burning should take place in mid- to late November. If weather conditions prevent this from occurring, the burn shall take place in spring of Year 3. 
Year 3. 
Spot herbicide control. Same as Year 1. 
Mowing or prescribed burning. Same as Year 2. 
After three years of establishment, it is expected that the only activity required for prolonged health of the natural areas of the site will be prescribed burning or annual mowing in the fall. Prescribed burning is the ideal management technique for long-term prairie and wetland health, and will be the only form of action required on three- to five-year intervals to maintain these areas indefinitely. 
The following species are the most likely to invade native establishment areas on the site and should be monitored. Should any of these appear on the site, appropriate control activities should be engaged as described in appendix A (Vegetation Management Guidelines). 
Prairie Habitats Common burdock (Arctium minus) Smooth brome (Bromus inermis) Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) Common teasel (Dipsacus sylvestrii) Tall sweet clover (Melilotus alba) Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis) Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) Wet-Mesic and Emergent Habitats Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) Common reed (Phragmites australis) Eastern cottonwood (tree) (Populus deltoides) Willow (shrub) (Salix spp.) Cattail (Typha spp.)  
Emergent habitats continued. Based upon observations of similar detention basin plantings during the first season following installation, it is anticipated that plant survival and shoreline colonization of pond and stream emergent species will be highly successful. When provided with proper hydrology and substrate conditions, these plantings require virtually no maintenance activities. The most critical recommended action is to control aggressive cattails, which commonly invade the site immediately following initial planting. Cattail removal should occur according to the following procedure: 
 The cattail stand shall be first treated in mid- to late May. All cattails shall be cut low to the ground. A systemic herbicide shall be applied to the cut cattail stumps with a wicking applicator. 
 For each 1,000 ft 2 of cattail stand surface area treated, the recommended herbicide and application rate is four and one-half Tbsp. (2.25 fl. oz.) aquatic glyphosate (RODEO) and 3 Tbsp. nonionic surfactant (X-77 or equivalent) in two and one-fourth gallons of water. 
 If standing water is present, cattails shall be cut as low as possible below the water line to attempt to kill the plant by suffocation. Herbicide shall not be applied to plants that are cut below the water line. Cattail plants shall not be allowed to progress beyond the early flowering stage. 
 Cattail stand maintenance shall continue through the first growing season, as deemed necessary by the wetland consultant, depending on the regrowth of the removed specimens. 
This activity is will need to be performed most heavily in the first year. Some light treatment may be required during the Year 2. It is anticipated that following the Year 2 season, the native plant communities installed in these areas will have developed sufficient densities to out-compete cattails attempting to become established. If necessary, the Year 2 treatment will consist of wick application of standing cattails during early summer utilizing the same Glyphosate mix described above. 
III.  Three-year monitoring/success criteria 
Year 1. Owner shall guarantee an average 80 percent aerial coverage of prescribed temporary seed crop and average 20 percent aerial coverage of "native permanent" seeded and plugged species by the end of the first growing season within all native planting zones. 
Year 2. Owner shall guarantee an average 45 percent aerial coverage of native "permanent" seeded and plugged species with 90 percent (by number) representation of prescribed species by the end of the second growing season. 
Year 3. Owner shall guarantee an average 80 percent aerial coverage of noninvasive native species throughout all native planting zones with 90 percent (by number) representation of all prescribed species by the end of the third growing season. Not more than an average ten percent aerial coverage may consist of exotic/invasive species listed in appendix A. 
Attachment Appendix A 
Vegetation Management Guideline 
Control Techniques 
Scientific Name Common Name Burn Mechanical Chemical Biological Recommendations Alliaria petiolata Garlic mustard Intense and thorough fall or spring burns. Cut flowering stems at ground level and remove. If done in full flower, plants will not resprout. Otherwise, pull entire plants, including roots, and remove from site. Glyphosate treatment in dormant season (spring or fall). Triclopyr (Garlon 3A) and clopyralid are selective broadleaf herbicides, which can be used during the dormant season to control basal rosettes, during late fall or early spring (to avoid nontargets). Possible fungal pathogens such as Fusarium solani may be possible in the near future. Hoffman and Kearns suggested possible use by 2005. Site specific, though a combination of hand-cutting, pulling, intense burning, and herbicide treatment for several years will probably be needed. Management should be continued until seed bank is exhausted. Arctium minus Common burdock Annual burn regime. A biennial weed that can be cut/removed after flowering. Hand pull 1st-yr plants, getting roots. Triclopyr (Garlon 3A) and clopyralid are selective broadleaf herbicides that can be used during the dormant season to control basal rosettes (late fall or early spring). Spot apply glyphosate, avoiding nontargets. Early fall and/or late spring burn, followed with selective herbicide treatment. Hand-pull when applicable. Bromus inermis Smooth brome Late spring burn, repeated annually or biennially. Need fire-adapted seed bank to compete to out-compete brome. Fire is ineffective when brome is dormant. If applicable, dig up clumps by hand. Mowing is not recommended. Black plastic is also an option. Glyphosate treatment in early spring/late fall when natives are dormant. Or, apply Fusilade 2000 (selective grass herbicide) following spring burn. Eliminate seed source from entering into project site. A combination of late spring burns, followed up with a selective glyphosate treatment before natives emerge. Plants supposedly have alleopathic tendencies, so hate it. Centaurea maculosa Spotted knapweed High intensity burn. WI DNR stated that a "hot" burn reduces population anywhere from 5-90%. Repeat annually, reseeding with native competition. Small infestations can be removed by digging or pulling. This is best done where the soil is moist, removing entire root. Mowing has not proven effective, plants simply flower at a lower height. Mowing just after flowering but prior to seed maturation is optional for areas with little other vegetation. Foliar triclopyr (3%) in water-soluble formulation. Picloram at 0.25-0.5 lbs/ac applied in spring or fall for best results (takes 2-3 yrs). Dicamba at 1-2 lbs/ac, applied annually for at least 2 yrs. Clopyralid at .25 lbs/ac and/or clopyralid at .19 lbs/ac + 2,4-D at 1 lb. (WIDNR) "Several biological controls exist, including two root mining months, a flower moth, and a root mining beetle. Most promising are the two seed-head attacking flies Urophora affinis and U. quadrifasciata. Congruently, these two gall flies have reduced seed production 95% in experimental populations." (WINDR) Consult USDA for details. Detect early and remove pioneering plants. A combination of herbicide treatment, used in conjunction with an intense fire regime. Cirsium arvense Canada thistle Perform late spring burn. Early spring burns will increase sprouting and reproduction. May burns will show increase in thistle 1st yr, though 2nd-yr abundance should be lowered. Immediate reductions occur following June burns. Repeated mowing, cutting, pulling (3 per yr)-July, Aug., Sept. recommended, or at 21-day intervals for 3-4 years. When plants are in full bloom, cut close to ground and remove. Low viability when cut after flowering. Done on a regular basis, mowing can prevent seed set while also stressing the plant. Ideal herbicide treatment is when plants area 6-10" tall, glyphosate or clopyralid (selective broadleaf herbicide) at recommended rates. Fall or spring applications evoke best translocation, as do younger plants. Avoid nontargets by using spot application and/or wicking method. Addition of a nitrogen fertilizer and/or plant growth regulators (i.e. morphactins) are also highly recommended. 2,4-D, glyphosate, alyphosphate, and picloram have high ratings of effectiveness. Thistle is most sensitive to 2,4-D at bud stage. Burn late spring or early fall Dactylis glomerata Orchard grass Late spring burn, repeated annually or biennially. Need fire-adapted seed bank to compete to out-compete orchard grass. Fire is ineffective when brome is dormant. If applicable, dig up clumps by hand. Mowing is not recommended. Black plastic is also an option. Glyphosate treatment in early spring/late fall when native plants are dormant. Or, apply Fusilade 2000 (selective grass herbicide) following spring burn. Eliminate seed source from entering into project site. A combination of late spring burns, followed up with a selective glyphosate treatment before natives emerge. Dioscorea oppositifolia Chinese yam Cut-stem treatment using glyphosate (and/or triclopyr?) Trial by error. Little is known about this plant. Dipsacus sylvestris Common teasel Late spring burn for sparse populations. Hand dig rosettes with dandelion digger, getting entire root. If in flowering stage, cut and remove plants. Seeds will continue to develop and mature even after cutting. Spot apply or wick with triclopyr, clopyralid, 2,4-D amine, and/or glyphosate. Triclopyr and clopyralid are both selective broadleaf herbicide. Treat basal rosettes in early spring or late fall to avoid impact on desirable plants. N/A Chemically treat basal rosettes in early spring or late fall, used in conjunction with a burning regime. Cut-remove flowering plants if infestations are low. Euphorbia esula Leafy spurge Not effective. If hand-pulling, digging, or tilling, remove all roots. Picloram, said to be the most effective, should be applied in late spring and early fall annually (not recommended in high quality areas). Fosamine (Krenite) applied in June and July (when blooming) may also prove effective. Glyphosate and dicamba are other alternatives. Several agents (flies, beetles, fungus, etc...) are being investigated as means of biological control. Goats. Black walnuts have allelopathic effects on plants growth. Picloram readily moves through the soil. Caution should be used when applying due to its high level of soil activity and 4-yr residual. An aggressive, long term approach is needed to exhaust seed bank. Festuca elation Tall fescue Late spring burn, repeated annually or biennially. Need fire-adapted seed bank to out-compete fescue. Fire is ineffective when brome is dormant. If applicable, dig up clumps by hand. Mowing is not recommended. Black plastic is also an option. Glyphosate treatment in early spring/late fall when native are dormant. Or, apply Fusilade 2000 (selective grass herbicide) following spring burn. Eliminate seed source from entering into project site. A combination of late spring burns, followed up with a selective glyphosate treatment before natives emerge. Lonicera tatarica 
Lonicera morrowii 
Lonicera x bella 
Lonicera japonica 
Lonicera maackii Honeysuckle In fire-adapted communities, spring burns, repeated annually or biennially for 5+ years. Burning, overall, will aid in native vegetation establishment, thus increasing competition with honeysuckle. Head-fires recommended. Hand pull younger plants, removing all roots (avoid sensitive areas to lessen reinvasion). Repeated mowing, once in July and once in Sept. recommended. Cut-stump treatment, using either glyphosate (20-50%) or triclopyr. Avoid triclopyr application if rain is in forecast for the following 1-4 days. For best results, treat in late summer, fall, or dormant season. Follow up to control resprouts. Foliar glyphosate in June, just after flowers bloom. Apply fosamine (Krenite) as foliar spray. Resprouting has been documented using cut-stem treatment with tricloyr. Cattle can help control it, though not destroy it. Late fall or winter grazing is best. The European honeysuckle aphid "somewhat" inhibits flower/fruit production, though native ladybug beetles control these aphids. Site specific. A combination of annual spring burns, in conjunction with either mowing/cutting, and/or cut-stump treatment. Seedlings can be treated with a foliar spray. Use glyphosate in early spring or late summer (be selective) or fosamine in August. Lotus corniculatus Bird's foot trefoil ? ? Difficult plant to treat. Foliar treatment of glyphosate in non-sensitive areas. Clopyralid, a selective broadleaf herbicide, may also be used according to label instructions. Cut-stem treatment is an option with low frequency. Lythrum salicaria Purple loosestrife Burn removed plants. If late in flowering stage, spray, and then cut, bag, and remove inflorescence. In low infestation, hand-pull or dig and remove (burn if possible). Another method involves cutting plant and removing it, and then flooding the site. Garlon 3A (foliar triclopyr) or Roundup if water is not present, and/or glyphosate (Rodeo + surface tant + AMS) when water is present. Apply at onset of inflorescence (when flowering 1st begins) using label instructions. Retreat later in summer, following annually for complete control. Avoid over-spray. Complete coverage not necessary for control. Cut-stem treatment can also be used for selective purposes. Galerucella calariensis, G., pusilla (leaf-eating beetles), Hylobius transversovittatus (root-mining weevil), and Nanophyes marmoratus (weevil). For large infestations, peripherally treat infestation, working towards center. This involves long-term management until seed bank is exhausted and native plants are re-established. Treating twice annual for multiple years is highly recommended. Use biological control only specificity of natural area. Melilotus spp Sweet clover Need 2 or more consecutive years of burning. Only 1 year will increase populations. Recommend April burn, followed the next year by May burn. Burns should be hot and complete. Hand-pull in late fall after the 1st-year root-crowns have developed, or in early spring of second year. It helps when ground is moist, removing most of the tap root. Cutting is also effective when done after the lower leaves have died back or at early stages of flowering-before seed set. Glyphosate treatment, though care should be taken to avoid non-targets. A triclopyr application can also be used, a selective broadleaf herbicide. Mecamine at 1% can also be used. A native sweet-clover weevil has been noted in helping to control both yellow and white sweet clover. However, it has been stated that the weevil needs to be in high concentrations to be effective, and is therefore not a reliable form of control. Site specific. 
(1) Combination of cutting and pulling. Follow with late spring burn, followed up with hand-pulling. 
(2) April burn, mow 1st-yr plants in Aug., and burn again in Sept. 
(3) For large populations, burn and hand spray plants (most effective in cotyledon stage). 
(4) Burn April 1st yr and then burn May 2d yr. Myriophyllum spicatum Eurasian water milfoil N/A Mechanical cutters and harvesters are relatively common. Hand cutters work best inshore, used in conjunction with hand pulling. Another option would be to use a diver-operated suction dredge. For colonies under .75 ac or <100 plants, hand pulling may be a viable option. Herbicide treatment is not readily recommended, though 2,4-D, Sonar, and Aquathol have proven effective in milfoil control. If chemicals are to be used, 2,4-D is recommended because of its broadleaf specificity and a high level aquatic monocotism. Eurhychiopsis lecontei, an herbivorous weevil native to North America has been documented to control the exotic milfoil. The fungi Mycoleptidiscus terrestris is also under research. Grass carp have also been introduced, but are not recommended due to environmental implications. If performing mechanical control, care should be taken to avoid fragmentation. Hand pulling is preferred because of selectivity and effectiveness, though is restricted to small populations. 
Eurhychiopsis lecontei, the milfoil weevil. Eurasian water milfoil supposedly lacks a defensive compound that native milfoils evolved, and has proven effective. EnviroScience, Inc., has patented a product called Middfoil, using such biological control. Phalaris arundinacea Reed canary grass Late spring burn to inhibit spread, repeated annually for 5-6 years. Need available native seed source to compete. In small stands, hand-pulling or digging. To control seed production, mow in early to mid-June and early October before seed matures. Disking/plowing may also be used in heavy infestations. Hand-chopping the culms at flowering time may also be used to increase mortality potential. Early spring glyphosate application. Apply before native emergence. If water is present Rodeo + recommended surfactant. N/A Site specific. 
(1) With pure stand of canary grass, burn late spring to remove thatch. Apply glyphosate at 1st emergence. Follow-up treatments will be necessary until seedbank is exhausted. 
(2) Use combination of burning, herbicide, and seed elimination strategies. 
*Increase native plant potential for competition. Phragmites australis Common reed grass Burning in combination with herbicide application. Burning helps in restoring available light for desire plants to compete. It also helps to remove thatch, increasing herbicide contact with leaves. Cutting/pulling/mowing in late July, repeated annually for several years. Remove cut shoots. Black plastic placement over cut stem may also work. Cutting + flooding sequence is another option, when permissible. Glyphosate application. Herbicide control is a 2-yr, 2-step process. Fall application is most effective (e.g., spraying after tasseling). In nonaquatic areas a grass-specific herbicide called fluazifop-P-butyl (product name Fusilade) can be used. Herbicide can be applied by backpack spraying, hand wicking, or tractor wicking (JFN). N/A *Eliminate land disturbances that favors Phragmites development. Burning (or mowing) in conjunction with fall herbicide application for several years. For containment purposes, mowing during the growing season is recommended. Phytolacca americana Pokeweed Poa pratensis Kentucky blue grass Burning effective in late spring, repeated annually. Need fire-tolerant natives to compete. Foliar glyphosate and/or Fusilade 2000 (selective grass herbicide) N/A Late spring burn followed with herbicide treatment. Populus spp Cottonwoods and/or aspen Repeated annual to biennial burns will control aspen within a "few decades." Late spring burn, after flowering, is most effective. Need fuel for "hot" fire, so seed bank release or seed implementation may be needed. Girdling: takes 1-2 years, minimizes resprouting. Best when done in early spring/late summer, removing only bark and phloem, and not xylem. Cutting/mowing twice annually will also help to control infestation. Remove nearby seed sources, if possible. Cut-stem treatment with glyphosate or triclopyr. Recommend treating in dormant fall season or on warm winter days in sensitive areas. Avoid triclopyr application if rain is in forecast for the following 1-4 days. Lower concentration of glyphosate (10-20%) has proven effective. Foliar treatment using fosamine, product name Krenite, is effective for small saplings and suckers. Apply July-Sept. only, using label instructions. Capsule injection method using EZJECT system. One casing every 2" at breast height. N/A Combination of girdling, cut-stem treatment, EZJECT system, fosamine application, and burning. Small saplings can be repeatedly mowed if possible. Site specific. Consider available resources, size of infestation, and size of trees. Rhamnus cathartica 
R. frangula Common buckthorn 
Glossy buckthorn High intensity burns recommended, repeated annually or biennially. Repeated cuttings (twice annually) for 2-3 years in nonsensitive areas. Resprouting is very intensive. Seedlings/small plants can be hand-pulled. Girdling may be done in dormant season and has low impact. Kill starlings. Cut-stem treatment w/glyphosate or triclopyr. Recommend treating in dormant fall season and on warm winter days to avoid/lessen impact to sensitive areas. Avoid triclopyr application if rain is in forecast for the following 1-4 days. Use either sponge application technique and/or a low pressure sprayer when applying to stumps. Another source recommended cutting in spring at leaf expansion, and then use cut-stem treatment in Aug/Sept. Depending on species and size of plant, possibly use the capsule injection method (EZJECT system). One casing every 2" at breast height. Possible fungal and insect pests currently being studied. Dormant season cut-stem treatment. Pathfinder II (triclopyr) has proven very effective. Annual burning regime. Robinia pseudoacacia Black locust Repeated "hot" annual, biennial fires for 6+ years. Initial burns will stimulate resprouting. Repeated mowing, 2-3 per annual growing season. Ineffective long-term. Cut-stem treatment with glyphosate or triclopyr. Avoid triclopyr application if rain is in forecast for the following 1-4 days. Recommend treating in dormant fall season or on warm winter days in sensitive areas. Girdling + herbicide (triclopyr preferred). Basal-bark treatment using triclopyr (Garlon 4 or Pathfinder II). Foliar spray using either fosamine (Krenite) in July-Sept or glyphosate in growing season. Krenite most effective when applied in Aug., and no later than Sept. 15. Such treatment may require follow-up applications. Capsule injection using EZJECT system has also proven effective. 1 casing every 2" at breast height. N/A Site specific. Combination of cut-stem stem, EZJECT (triclopyr capsules) treatment, Krenite, girdling + herbicide, and an aggressive burning regime. Follow-up treatments most likely necessary with any given technique. Use of Tordon RTU (picloram) is not recommended due to environmental hazards and contamination potential. Rosa multiflora Multiflora rose Prescribed burns slow invasion. Late spring burns recommended. 3-6 mowings/cuttings per season for 2-4 years achieves high plant mortality. For light infestations hand pulling/grubbing, removing all roots. Systemic herbicide highly recommended. Foliar treatment during active growing season, using either glyphosate or fosamine. Cut-stump treatment and/or basal bark treatment, using high % glyphosate or triclopyr (an extremely effective basal bark herbicide). Most effective in late growing season (July/Sept) and/or dormant season. Use either a sponge application technique and/or a low pressure sprayer when applying to stumps. Avoid triclopyr application if rain is in forecast for the following 1-4 days. Use fosamine (product name Krenite) application in July-Sept (most effective in Aug.). Rose rosette disease has proven fatal to Rosa species. However, more biological data is needed. See TNC. Cut-stem treatment, followed w/burn regime to promote native vegetation. establishment. Retreatment will most likely be needed. Using fosamine as a foliar spray in August, will also promote control. Salix spp Willow spp. Burn annually for control Need fuel to carry "hot" fire. Mowing twice annually will help control, though not eliminate plant. Cut-stem treatment preferred, using glyphosate and/or triclopyr. Foliar application can be used using glyphosate and/or fosamine (Krenite). Apply Krenite late summer. Capsule injection method, (EZJECT treatment), 1 capsule every 2" at DBH. N/A Cut-stem treatment with selected herbicide. Burn annually until area is controlled. Securigera varia Crown vetch Ulmus pumila Siberian elm Burn annually or biennially in fire-adapted communities. If done right, girdling is very effective, taking 1-2 yrs. If applicable, hand-pull seedlings. Remove nearby sources if possible. Cut-stem treatment in fall or on warm winter days preferred, using glyphosate and/or triclopyr. Foliar glyphosate or fosamine (Krenite) may also be used (avoid non-targets). The capsule injection method using the EZJECT system is another alternative. 1 casing every 2" at breast height. Cut-stem treatment used in conjunction with an annual burn regime to kill resprouts and saplings. Saplings not killed by fire should by hand-pulled or foliar sprayed. Typha angustifolia 
T. x glauca 
T. latifolia Narrow-leaved 
Hybrid cattail 
Broad-leaved Burn to remove thatch, increasing effectiveness of herbicide applications. In standing water, cut dormant stalks beneath water line to drown plant in spring.

This statement shall contain a legal description of the premises served, and the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount. 
(b)  Notice of such lien claim shall be mailed by the village clerk to the owner or occupant of the premises, whenever such bills remain unpaid for a period of 30 days after they have been mailed to the owner's or occupant's last known address. 
(c)  The failure of the village clerk to record such lien claim or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner or occupant to receive such notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid weed abatement bills as outlined herein. 
(d)  Property subject to a lien for such unpaid bills shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in the name of the Village of Bourbonnais.

Editor's note- Reference appendix 2, Applications for sewer permits, has not been set out at length herein but is available in the office of the village clerk. 
Sec. 35-18. - Building sewers and connections. 
(a)  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with, or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the village. 
(b)  All disposal by any person into the sewer system is unlawful except those discharges in compliance with federal standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Act and more stringent state and local standards. 
(c)  When service is desired, the owner or the owner's agent shall make application on a form to be provided by the village. The application shall be supplemented by any specifications, plans or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the village. 
(1)  Connection fee. At the time the application is filed, a connection fee shall be paid to the village as follows: 
a.  Nine hundred dollars per population equivalent for new users whose real estate is located within the corporate limits of the village, or whose property is subject to an annexation agreement 
b.  One thousand, three hundred fifty dollars per population equivalent for new users whose real estate is located outside the corporate limits of the village and not subject to an annexation agreement. 
(2)  Population equivalents. 
a.  For residential users, the number of population equivalent units shall be based upon the IEPA standards as to the number of persons per particular type of residential dwelling unit, as follows: 
Efficiency or studio apartment = 1 P.E. 1-bedroom apartment = 1.5 P.E. 2-bedroom apartment = 3 P.E. 3-bedroom apartment = 3 P.E. Single-family dwelling = 3.5 P.E. Mobile home = 2.25 P.E.  
b.  For commercial or industrial users, the number of population equivalent units shall be the highest number calculated by checking the estimated or known daily sanitary effluent by each of the following three tests: 
1.  Volume of 100 gallons per day = one P.E. 
2.  B.O.D. loading of 0.17 pounds per day = one P.E. 
3.  Suspended solids of 0.20 pounds per day = one P.E. 
c.  For commercial and industrial users, the minimum P.E. shall be no less than four. For the purpose of determining the volume as indicated in [subsection] b.1. above, the village records of water usage for similar establishments shall be averaged. If no similar establishments exist within the village, the applicant shall be charged the minimum of four P.E. Should the first six-month history of water usage indicate that P.E. is greater than four, this charge shall be adjusted upward to reflect the actual P.E. as soon as a six-month history of water usage becomes available. 
(3)  Inspection fee. At the time the application is filed, an inspection fee of $50.00 shall be paid to the village. 
(d)  A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sewer connection shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage facilities, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load. 
(e)  All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
(f)  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the building sewer from the front of the building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. 
(g)  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found to be sound and serviceable, on examination and test by the village. 
(h)  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the village. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in the most recently released specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials, "Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice," and "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois" shall apply. 
(i)  In all buildings in which the lowest fixture is less than three feet above the rim of the nearest sanitary sewer system manhole lid, a village-approved backwater valve shall be installed and/or be lifted or pumped by means approved by the Illinois Plumbing Code, and discharged to the building sewer. 
The building sewer shall be brought to the building at a depth of 12 inches to 24 inches below finished grade. 
(j)  No person(s) shall make connection of roof down spouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain, which in turn is connected directly or indirectly, to a public sanitary sewer. 
(1)  Certificate of compliance. Effective upon passage and publication of this article, at every change of ownership of any occupied building which is in any way connected to the Bourbonnais Sanitary Sewer System, whether located inside or outside the corporate limits of the village, including residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, educational, recreation, or group use, it shall be the duty of the grantor to certify by an inspection by the village and a certificate of compliance from the village, before change of ownership, to the new owner that there are no illegal connections to the village sanitary sewer system. Failure to comply with this section shall be punishable as set forth herein. 
(2)  Correction. In the event that a property is found to be in violation of subsection (j) hereinabove, then such illegal connection shall be corrected immediately to the satisfaction of the village authorities, but no more than 30 days after the finding of a violation. 
(3)  Violations. The failure of a property owner to obtain a certificate of compliance from the village and/or correct the illegal connection shall also be considered as a violation of subsection (j). 
(4)  Penalties. The illegal connection of a property to the village sanitary sewer system or the failure to obtain a certificate of compliance shall be considered punishable pursuant to the penalties section 35-23 of the village Code of Ordinances. 
(5)  Disconnection. In addition to the penalties assessed under section 35-23, if the illegal connection to the sanitary sewer is not corrected within 90 days after its finding, then the village may disconnect the property from the sanitary sewer system thereby discontinuing service to the property. 
Before disconnecting the service, the village shall notify the owner and service user on the property in writing of the village's intention to disconnect the property from the sewer system. The owner or system user shall be given 30 days from the date of the notice to correct the illegal connection and pay the fines, all costs and charges imposed by the village. 
All notices sent under this article shall be sent by certified mail or delivered by personal service to the occupant of the property or owner. 
The costs for disconnection shall be considered as a lien on the property and shall not be less than the actual costs incurred by the village for the disconnection, together with attorney's fees, expenses and an administrative fee of 15 percent of said costs incurred by the village in enforcing these provisions. 
Services shall not be reinstated until the fines, costs for disconnection, administrative and service charges and attorney's fees are paid in full, including costs to the village for reconnection of the sanitary sewer system to the property. 
(6)  Authority. Authority for inspection by village authorities or their authorized agents is set forth in this section 35-21. 
(7)  Liens. If any property is found to be in violation of these provisions by reason of an illegal connection or failure to obtain a certificate of compliance and the fine remains unpaid for 90 days after it has been ordered paid, the village treasurer shall file with the Kankakee County Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien against the property. 
The lien statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid fine and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all interest, charges, service fees, disconnection fees and reconnection fees subsequent to the period covered by the bill. 
A lien is created under the preceding sentence only if the municipality sends to the owner or owners of record of the real estate on which the services required: (1) A copy of the delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the fine or other notice sufficient to inform the owner or owners of record that the find has become delinquent; (2) A notice the unpaid fine may create a lien on the real estate which receives the unpaid services. 
Notice of lien. After service of said notice upon the owner or owners, if the fine remains unpaid, the village shall file with the county recorder of deeds, a notice of lien claim. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting out: (1) a description of such real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, and (2) the amount of money due for such fine, and (3) the date when such amount became delinquent. The village shall also cause to be mailed a copy of the notice of lien to the owner or owners of record of the real estate as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number. The failure of the village to record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid fines. 
Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid fines shall be sold for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay fines, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid 90 days and a lien has been recorded. The village attorney is also authorized to sue the occupant or user of the real estate in a civil action to recover money due (for fines) and attorney's fees incurred in collecting the delinquency. 
(k)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code, or other applicable rules and regulations of the village, or the procedures set forth in the most recently released specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials, "Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice," and "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois." All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Village of Bourbonnais before installation. 
(l)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the village when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the village or its representative. 
(m)  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village.

(2)  Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant. 
(3)  Any waters or wastes giving a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works. 
(4)  Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, or, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders. 
(d)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the village that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming this opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the village will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and maximum limits established by regulatory agencies.

(e)  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) of this section, and/or which are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in Chapter 1, EPA Rules and Regulations, subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128 Pretreatment Standards, Federal Register Volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973 and any amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the village may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the village may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions of subsection (k) of this section. 
If the village permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the village and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, articles, and laws. 
(f)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the village they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the village, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(g)  Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(h)  Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when required by the village, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the village. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at such owner's expense, and shall be maintained by such owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(i)  The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this article and any special conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge. 
The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village, but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the village. At such times as deemed necessary the village reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service. 
(j)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(k)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefore, in accordance with section 35-31, hereof, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charge system and industrial cost recovery system.

Sec. 35-34. - Discontinuance for delinquent bills; liens. 
(a)  [Statement of lien claim.] Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for 90 days after it has been rendered, the village attorney shall file with the Kankakee County Recorder of Deeds a statement of lien claim. The statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all interest, changes and service fees and disconnection fees subsequent to the period covered by the bill. 
A lien is created under the preceding sentence only if the municipality sends to the owner or owners of record of the real estate on which the services required: (1) a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to inform the owner or owners of record that the charges or rates have become delinquent; a notice the unpaid charge or rate may create a lien on the real estate which receives the unpaid services. 
(b)  Notice of lien. After service of said notice upon the owner or owners, if the charges or rates remain unpaid, the village shall file with the county recorder of deeds a notice of lien claim. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting out (1) a description of such real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, and (2) the amount of money due for such sewerage service, and (3) the date when such amount became delinquent. The village shall also cause to be mailed a copy of the notice of lien to the owner or owners of record of the real estate as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number. The failure of the village to record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills. 
(c)  Additional charges. In all cases where the use charge for sewage service has become delinquent and the village elects to file a statement thereof in the office of the recorder of deeds as hereinabove set forth, there shall be added in addition to the amount due the village such charges and expenses as are necessary and required to verify the legal description of the property to which the lien is to attach, plus the recorder's fee for the filing of such statement plus the cost of preparation of such notices and forms required. In each instance, the village attorney shall be authorized and directed to include such additional costs in the amount claimed due the village in the notice of lien. 
The village shall add interest at a rate of eight percent per annum on all liens filed against property owners for delinquent charges, and shall add interest at a rate of nine percent per annum on all judgments filed against users or property owners for delinquent user charges. 
(d)  Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over such matter against any property for such the bill has remained unpaid 45 days and a lien has been recorded. The village attorney is also authorized to sue the occupant or user of the real estate in a civil action to recover money due for sewerage services and attorneys fees incurred in collecting the delinquency. 
(e)  [Disconnection of service.] If the sewer service fees and charges are not paid within 90 days after the rendering of the bill for sewer services the village may disconnect the property from the sewer system thereby discontinuing the service to the property. 
Before disconnecting the service, the village shall notify the owner and service user on the property, if not the owner, in writing of their intention to disconnect the property from the sewer system. The owner or the user shall be given 30 days from the date of the notice to pay the unpaid service fee and interest charges.

(Ord. No. 89-727, § 300.120, 10-2-89) 
Sec. 35-86. - Pretreatment. 
    All industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards within the time limitations as specified by appropriate statutes, regulations, and this article. National categorical pretreatment standards shall be added to this article as amendments. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the POTW shall be provided, properly operated and maintained, at the user's expense. All industrial users shall obtain all necessary construction and operating permits from the IEPA. Such pretreatment facilities shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA certified wastewater treatment operator. Any subsequent physical changes in the pretreatment facilities or significant change in the method of operation shall be submitted to and approved by the POTW prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. 
(Ord. No. 89-727, § 300.125, 10-2-89) 
Sec. 35-87. - Prohibition of improper dilution. 
    No user shall increase the use or process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards (NCPS), when effective, or in any other pollutant-specific limitations developed by the POTW. 
(Ord. No. 89-727, § 300.130, 10-2-89) 
Sec. 35-88. - Spill containment. 
(a)  Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference with the POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this article shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited material or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. 
(b)  All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the POTW showing facilities and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental discharge. All industrial users shall complete construction of said facilities by such dates as the POTW shall determine, taking into consideration the complexity and extent of construction required to comply with this article and the potential harm which may be caused to the POTW. All significant industrial users shall complete construction of said spill containment facilities within one year of the effective date of this article or within one year of beginning discharge, whichever is later. However, if a different date for completing construction of said spill containment facilities is set in the significate industrial user's wastewater discharge permit by the POTW, after taking into consideration the complexity and extent of construction required to comply with this article and the potential harm which may be caused to the POTW, that date shall apply. No industrial user who begins contributing to or could contribute such pollutants to the POTW after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce such pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the POTW and installed by the industrial user. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(c)  In the case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants which may cause interference at the POTW or will pass through the POTW or violate requirements of this article, it shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller, location and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration and volume. 
(d)  Within 15 days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge the industrial user shall submit to the POTW a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Followup reports may be required by the POTW as needed. Such report, or reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the POTW, result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit. 
(e)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(f)  A notice in English and the language of common use shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental or illegal discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedures. 
(Ord. No. 89-727, § 300.135, 10-2-89) 
Sec. 35-89. - Wastewater haulers. 
(a)  Wastewater haulers shall discharge all sanitary wastes at a designated wastewater hauler dumping station. 
(b)  Wastewater haulers shall have a valid wastewater hauler discharge permit before discharging wastes at the POTW. Each permitted wastewater hauling vehicle shall prominently display a number issued by the POTW on both doors of the vehicle cab. Such numbers shall be removable only by destruction. Decals for this purpose will be provided by the POTW to each wastewater hauler. 
(c)  Each wastewater hauling vehicle shall meet the following conditions before permits will be issued under subsection 35-89(b): 
(1)  Until the POTW provides scales for weighing wastewater-hauling vehicles, each truck tank shall have a sight glass calibrated in 100-gallon increments. 
(2)  Each vehicle shall be equipped to use the quick disconnect couplers at the wastewater hauler dumping station. 
(d)  Representative samples of wastewater from both nonindustrial users and industrial users discharged by a wastewater hauler shall comply with the provisions of division 3. 
(e)  Each load delivered to the wastewater dumping station must have a wastewater hauler manifest properly filled out by the scale operator on duty and signed by the wastewater hauler. 
(f)  All procedures for discharging, for cleanliness and for general sanitary operation on the POTW property as prescribed by the POTW shall be strictly adhered to by all wastewater haulers delivering wastewater to the POTW dumping station. 
(g)  The source or sources of all liquid wastes being hauled to the POTW treatment plant shall be properly documented using the POTW manifest system. 
(h)  Wastewater from a nonindustrial user shall not be mixed with wastewater from an industrial user. Vehicles hauling wastewater from an industrial user shall not be used to haul wastewater from a nonindustrial user from disposal at the POTW. 
(i)  In addition to remedies available to the POTW set forth elsewhere in this article, failure of a wastewater hauler to comply with the provisions of this section shall be grounds for revocation of the hauler's discharge permit by the POTW. 
(Ord. No. 89-727, § 300.140, 10-2-89) 
Secs. 35-90-35-100. - Reserved.

b.  List of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
1.  Regulated process streams, and 
2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(e). 
e.  The industrial user shall identify the national categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall: 
1.  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
2.  Where feasible, obtain samples through the flow-proportional composite sampling techniques specified in the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. Where composite sampling is not feasible, a grab sample is acceptable. 
3.  Sample based on the flow of the sampled stream, as follows (composite samples are required where feasible): 
i.  Where the flow of the steam being sampled is less than or equal to 950,000 liters per day (approximately 250,000 gallons per day), the industrial user shall take a minimum of three samples within a two-week period. 
ii.  Where the flow of the stream being sampled is greater than 950,000 liters per day (approximately 250,000 gallons per day), the industrial user shall take a minimum of six samples within a two-week period. 
4.  Take the samples immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, in order to evaluate compliance with the national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(3). Where an alternate concentration has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW. 
5.  Submit, only with POTW authorization, a baseline report which utilizes only historical data, so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
6.  Provide for each report the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards. 
g.  If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. 
1.  Where the industrial user's national categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR section 403.7) or the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR section 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations (40 CFR section 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline report the information required in subsections 35-104(a)(4)f. and g. shall pertain to the modified limits. 
2.  If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as a response to subsections 35-104(a)(4)f. and g. and submit them to the POTW within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
h.  The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in response to subsection 35-104(a)(4)g.: 
1.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
2.  No increment referred to in subsection 35-104(a)(4)h.1. shall exceed six months. 
3.  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the POTW including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the POTW. 
i.  Such other information as may be reasonably requested by the POTW. 
(b)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, within such time as specified in its wastewater discharge permit, but in any case no later than one year following commencement of the introduction by the new source or wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the POTW a report, on forms provided by the POTW, indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional user operation and maintenance or pretreatment techniques or installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(c)  Periodic compliance reports for categorical industrial users. 
(1)  All significant industrial users subject to an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such applicable national categorical pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, after discharge of wastewater to the POTW begins, shall submit to the POTW during the months of June and December for the preceding two calendar quarters unless required more frequently in the national categorical pretreatment standard or by the POTW or IEPA, a certified report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such applicable national categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. 
(2)  At the discretion of the POTW, the wastewater discharge permittee shall sample, analyze and report to the POTW pollutants set forth in its wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  At the discretion of the POTW and in consideration of such factors as a local high or low flow rate, holidays, or budget cycles, the POTW may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted.

Sec. 35-105. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  Significant industrial users shall provide and operate at the significant industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user's premises but the POTW may, when such a location would be impractical and cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user. 
(b)  Where required by the POTW, additional control manholes or sampling chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards. 
(c)  Whenever required by a wastewater discharge permit, any significant industrial user shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the POTW, installed and maintained at all times at the user's expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to permit the POTW to take accurate composite samples for analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized representatives of the POTW at any time. 
(1)  Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus flume unless a weir or similar device is approved by the POTW with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or at the discretion of the POTW the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where it is substantiated to the POTW that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the POTW is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. 
(2)  When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as determined the by POTW, and properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance with standard methods and shall be composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. Such sampling shall be done as prescribed by the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  The sampling chamber, metering device, and documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection and verification by the POTW. 
(d)  Whenever required by a wastewater discharge permit, the permittee shall pay the costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples, whether or not the sampling and analyses are done by the permittee or by the POTW. 
(e)  All measurements, tests and analyses to which reference is made in this article shall be determined and performed in accordance with the procedures established by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter "administrator") pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR [part] 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties approved by the administrator.

Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the POTW may have under this article, statutes [and] regulations, at law or in equity. 
(b)  If the discharge from any industrial user causes a deposit, obstruction or damage to any of the POTW wastewater facility, the POTW shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials, labor, and supervision, shall be borne by the person or industrial user causing such deposit, obstruction or damage. 
(c)  The remedies provided in this article shall not be exclusive and the POTW may seek whatever other remedies are authorized by statute, at law or in equity against any person or industrial user violating the provisions of this article.

ARTICLE VIII. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING; ALL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article of the zoning ordinance is to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public streets, and so promote the safety and welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is put. 
Sec. 2. - Scope of regulations. 
    The off-street parking and loading provisions of this chapter shall apply as follows: 
2.1. Off-street parking and loading facilities. For all buildings and structures erected and for all uses of land established after the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment hereto, accessory off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided for each particular type of permitted or special use. Where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, provided construction is begun within 90 days after the effective date thereof and diligently prosecuted to completion (completion to be accomplished within 18 months from the effective date of this chapter), parking and loading facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different amount required by this chapter. 
2.2. Increased parking and loading facilities. Where the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, additional parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use only. 
2.3. New off-site parking and loading facilities. Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. If the said building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount for the new use. 
2.4. Existing off-street parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment hereto, and located on the same zoning lot as the building, structure or use served, shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of the chapter. 
2.5. Floor area determination adjustment. The amount of gross floor area for land uses appearing in "schedule of off-street parking requirements" utilized for determining the number of off-street parking spaces required shall be reduced in the amount by which the building places for such land uses show space devoted to atriums, auditoriums and cafeterias which are not open to the general public. Any reduction in required off-street parking spaces provided herein shall be based upon final architectural plans and specifications. 
2.6. Damage or destruction. For any building containing a conforming use, legal special use, or legal nonconforming use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter, and which building is subsequently damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, such building may be constructed, re-established, or repaired provided off-street parking and loading facilities in an amount equivalent to that maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. In no case, however, shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking and loading facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or construction. 
2.7. Submission of plot plan and plat of survey. An application for a building permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The plan shall show: 
(a)  The use of the building, structure, or parcel of land. 
(b)  The number of dwelling units, gross floor area, design capacity, estimated number of employees, or other units of measurement specified herein for determining the number of off-street parking spaces or loading berths requirement by this chapter. 
(c)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all parking facilities shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets; to reasonable circulation for traffic within and adjacent to parking areas; to topographical conditions and to runoff of storm water; and public convenience and safety. No building, entrance permit, or zoning certificate shall be issued until the plot plan showing all required off-street parking and loading facilities is approved by the village engineer and/or village code enforcement officer. 
2.8. Permissive off-street parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve an existing use of a building, structure or parcel of land provided that all regulations governing the location, design, and control of such facilities are adhered to. 
When off-street parking or loading facilities are established, they may be decreased only when the facilities remaining will be at least equal to, or exceed the off-street parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the standards of this chapter to the entire use of the building, structure, or parcel of land as modified. 
2.9. Parking area design. It shall be the responsibility of the code enforcement department to review and approve plans for all parking lots containing more than four spaces located less than 40 feet from a residence district line. Upon approval of the plans, the code enforcement department shall issue a building certificate for such parking area. 
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all parking areas shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets; to reasonable circulation for traffic within and adjacent to parking areas; to topographical conditions and to the runoff of storm water; and public convenience and safety. All parking areas including entrances and exits shall be designed in accordance with the "off-street parking chart" and/or the village engineer. 
2.10. Handicapped parking. All uses except single-family detached or attached dwellings shall be required to provide off-street parking spaces for handicapped persons in accordance with the standards established by the State of Illinois. 
2.11. Time of construction/off-street parking and loading facilities. Off-street parking and loading facilities, as required by this chapter, shall be constructed at the time of erection, establishment, alteration, or enlargement of any building, structure, or use of land. No occupancy certificate shall be issued by the code enforcement department until the required parking and loading facilities have been installed. 
Sec. 3. - General requirements. 
3.1. Exemption. When the application of the off-street parking provisions specified in this chapter results in a requirement of not more than three spaces on a single zoning lot in any business or manufacturing district, such parking spaces need not be provided where the building is unmanned; however, where two or more uses are located on a single lot, only one of those shall be eligible for the above exemption. 
3.2. Location. Off-street automobile parking facilities shall be located as hereinafter specified, provided however, that no parking area shall be located within five feet from any lot line; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking area to the nearest entrance of the building that said parking area is required to serve. 
3.2-1. For one- and two-family dwellings. On the same lot with the buildings they are required to serve. 
3.2-2. For three- and four-family dwellings not over two stories in height. On the same lot or parcel of land as the building they are required to serve. For the purpose of this requirement, a group of such uses constructed and maintained under single ownership or management shall be assumed to be on a single lot or parcel of land. 
3.2-3. For apartment houses containing four or more dwelling units. On the same lot or parcel of land as the building they are required to serve, or on a separate lot or parcel of land not more than 300 feet from the nearest entrance to the main building being served, provided the lot or parcel of land selected for the parking facilities is located in an apartment district or a less restricted district. 
3.2-4. For rooming houses, lodging houses, clubs, hospitals, sanitariums, orphanages, homes for the aged, convalescent homes, dormitories, sorority and fraternity houses, and for other similar uses. The off-street parking facilities required shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the main building or buildings being served, or upon properties contiguous to the zoning lot upon which is located the building or buildings they are intended to serve. 
3.2-5. For uses other than those specified above. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot or parcel of land as the main building being served, or on a separate lot or parcel of land not over 1,000 feet from the entrance of the main building, measured from the nearest point of the parking area, provided the separate lot or parcel of land intended for the parking facilities is located in the same district as the principal permitted use or in a less restricted district. 
3.3. Control of off-site parking facilities. When required accessory off-street parking facilities are provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located, they shall be in the same possession, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property occupied by such principal use, and the owner shall be bound by covenants filed of record in the Kankakee County Recorder of Deeds requiring the owner and his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking spaces during the existence of said principal use. 
3.4. Size and configuration. Except as hereinafter provided, each required off-street parking space shall be not less than nine feet in width and not less than 18 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office or work areas. Such spaces shall have a vertical clearance of not less than seven feet, and the width thereof shall be measured at right angles to the axis of the vehicle. For parallel parking spaces, the length of the space shall be increased to 22 feet. Where there are particular difficulties or on due cause shown, or where the public safety or public convenience would be better served, the Plan Commission, acting upon a specific application, may authorize modifications in all B-1, B-2, M-1 and M-2 Districts as follows: 
(a)  Compact car facilities where allowed shall be limited to 25 percent of the spaces required for the site. 
(b)  The minimum stall size for compact car facilities shall be not less than eight feet in width and not less than 15 feet in depth. 
(c)  All compact car facilities (areas) shall be appropriately marked by signs designating those spaces as "for compact cars only." 
3.5. Off-street parking chart. All other requirements as to parking stall and aisle width shall be as set forth or interpolated from the "Off-street parking chart" contained in the appendix. 
3.6. Access. Parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in such a manner as will least interfere with the movement of traffic. No driveway or curb cut in any district shall exceed 65 feet in width. 
3.7. Collective provision. Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use. 
3.8. Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half shall be counted as one parking space. Where parking spaces are required on an employee basis, they shall be based on the maximum number of employees on a shift (duty) at any one time. 
3.9. Utilization. Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking of trucks where a special use has been granted, required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed in this chapter shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles in operating condition by patrons, occupants, or employees.

For B-1/B-2, M-1/M-2, the minimum requirement shall be eight inches of compacted aggregate. 
3.10-4. Curbs. In all cases where off-street parking areas are used for storm water management purposes, such areas shall be improved with permanent Portland Concrete curb(s) or good quality approved bumper blocks and shall be so located that no part of any parked vehicle shall extend beyond the property line or overhang any adjacent sidewalk or landscaped area. Landscaped areas including plant material shall not be planted so that there is any interference with the overhang of parked vehicles. 
3.10-5. Wheel guards. All off-street parking space within parking lots shall be provided with concrete wheel guards, bumper guards or continuous curbs permanently secured to the finished surface along the perimeter line and abutting the building.

In all off-street parking facilities, open to the sky, having a paved area greater than 500 square feet, a minimum of ten percent of such area shall be landscaped to create visual relief. This landscaping shall be required in addition to any other landscaping required under this section and such landscaping shall be established to break (soften) the expanse of paving. 
3.10-8. Lighting or other equipment. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking facilities shall be directed away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as to not create a nuisance. In no case shall lighting exceed three foot candles measured at the property line.

(Ord. No. 05-1526, § 4, 10-3-05) 
Sec. 2. - Special uses. 
2.1. Purpose. The principal objective of this zoning ordinance is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses, and for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the village. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various districts established by this chapter. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to allow because of their unusual characteristics or the services they provide the public. These "special uses" require particular consideration as to their proper location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses, or to the planned development of the community. The conditions controlling the location and operation of such "special uses" are established by the following provisions of this section. 
2.2. Conditions of approval. The plan commission of the Village of Bourbonnais may recommend, that the board of trustees may impose, such restrictions upon the height, bulk and area of occupancy of any structure so approved for "special use" as may be reasonable under the particular circumstances, provided that such restrictions and stipulations shall not be more restrictive than the requirements established for the district in which such structure is proposed to be located, or as may be required in any municipal code. Off-street parking facilities as well as off-street loading and unloading spaces may also be stipulated in the order permitting the "special uses." 
2.3. Procedure. The procedure to be followed in considering application for "special uses" shall be as follows: 
2.3-1. Application for amendment and notice of public hearing. An application for a special use shall be as follows: 
(a)  Written application for a special use shall be made on forms in the manner prescribed by the village. 
(b)  The application shall be accompanied by a filling fee pursuant to article XVII herein. 
(c)  The plan commission shall cause notice of a public hearing on the application for a special use, giving notice of the time and place not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the hearing on publishing a notice thereof at least once in a newspaper published or circulated in the village. This notice shall contain the particular location for which the special use is requested as well as a statement of what the proposed use consists. Notice shall contain a legal description and street address, or if none, such other information so as to reasonably locate the property for which the special use is sought. 
(d)  The applicant shall cause to be notified not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing all property owners of record located within 150 feet of the subject property, exclusive of any public right-of-way. Said notification, which shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, shall include the legal description of said property, common address and/or location of said property, names of petitioners, a brief statement describing the proposed development, and the time, date and location of the public hearing to be held by the plan commission. Additionally, petitioner shall provide to the village, not less than seven days prior to the scheduled hearing, a typed and notarized affidavit listing the names and addresses of all such owners of record, along with said return receipts from said mailing. If any of the foregoing requirements providing for mailed notice and publication are not complied within the time frames set forth, the public hearing shall be cancelled and the applicant shall be required to pay an additional filing fee if the hearing is to be rescheduled.
