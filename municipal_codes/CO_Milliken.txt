SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Milliken, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last . 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

PREFACE 
The Town of Milliken, a statutory town, has published its Municipal Code in a format which features the following: 
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided. 
The three-place section numbering system places the chapter number first, followed by the article number and section number, separated by hyphens. Each section may be cited by the chapter, article and section number which are in sequence within each chapter. 
The open chapter and page numbering system creates reserved chapter and page numbers for expansion or revision of the Code without undue complication when changes are made to the Code by supplementation. 
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the Code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present Code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the Code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation. 
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate Code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate. 
Supplements to the Code provide regular updating of the Code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the Code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the Code.

To the extent required by law, the Company shall collect this fee from a surcharge upon Town residents who are customers of the Company. 
(2)  Obligation in lieu of fee. In the event that the franchise fee specified herein is declared void for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless prohibited by law, the Company shall be obligated to pay the Town, at the same times and in the same manner as provided in the franchise, an aggregate amount equal to the amount which the Company would have paid as a franchise fee as partial consideration for use of the Town streets. To the extent required by law, the Company shall collect the amounts agreed upon through a surcharge upon utility service provided to Town residents. 
(3)  Changes in utility service industries. The Town and the Company recognize that utility service industries are the subject of restructuring initiatives by legislative and regulatory authorities and are also experiencing other changes as a result of mergers, acquisitions and reorganizations.

In recognition of the length of the term of this franchise, the Company agrees that, in the event of any such initiatives or changes and to the extent permitted by law, upon receiving a written request from the Town, the Company will cooperate with and assist the Town in modifying this franchise to assure that the Town receives an amount in franchise fees or some other form of compensation that is the same amount of franchise fees paid to the Town as of the date that such initiatives and changes adversely impact franchise fee revenues. 
(4)  Utility service provided to the Town. No franchise fee shall be charged to the Town for utility service provided to the Town for its own consumption, including street lighting service and traffic signal lighting service. 
(b)  Consumption-based franchise fee conversion. If, at any time during the term of this franchise, the Company agrees to pay any Colorado municipality a franchise fee measured against the total consumption of gas or electricity in each month by each resident, then the Company shall, within sixty (60) days of executing said agreement, provide written notice to the Town, which notice shall include the consumption-based franchise calculation. If requested by the Town, the Company shall supply the Town with such relevant information that the parties agree is necessary to assist the Town in its evaluation of the consumption-based franchise fee calculation. If the Town elects to convert to a consumption-based franchise fee, the Town shall provide written notice to the Company. Within sixty (60) days after receiving said notice, the Company shall begin paying consumption-based franchise fees to the Town on the same basis on which it pays consumption-based gas and/or electric franchise fees to any other Colorado municipality, as selected by the Town. 
(c)  Remittance of franchise fee. 
(1)  Remittance schedule. Franchise fee revenues shall be remitted by the Company to the Town in monthly installments not more than thirty (30) days following the close of each month. 
(2)  Corrections of franchise fee payments. In the event that either the Town or the Company discovers that there had been an error in the calculation of the franchise fee payment to the Town, it shall provide written notice to the other party of the error. If the party receiving written notice of error does not agree with the written notice of error, that party may challenge the written notice of error pursuant to Paragraph (4) below; otherwise, the error shall be corrected in the next monthly payment. However, if the error results in an overpayment of the franchise fee to the Town and said overpayment is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), credit for overpayment shall be spread over the same period the error was undiscovered. All franchise fee underpayments shall be corrected in the next monthly payment, together with interest computed at the rate set by the PUC for customer security deposits held by the Company, from the date when due until the date paid. In no event shall either party be required to fund or refund any overpayment or underpayment made as a result of a Company error which occurred more than five (5) years prior to the discovery of the Company error. 
(3)  Audit of franchise fee payments. 
a.  Every three (3) years, commencing at the end of the third year of this franchise, the Company shall conduct an internal audit to investigate and determine the suitability of the franchise fee paid to the Town. Such audit shall be limited to the previous three (3) calendar years. The Company shall provide a written report to the Town Administrator containing the audit findings regarding the franchise fee paid to the Town for the previous three (3) calendar years. 
b.

ARTICLE V - Medical Marijuana Establishment Regulations and Licensing 

Sec. 6-5-10. - Findings and legislative intent. 
    The Town Board of Trustees adopts this Article based upon the following findings of fact: 
(1)  On November 7, 2000, the voters of the State of Colorado approved Amendment 20. Amendment 20 added Section 14 of Article XVIII to the Colorado Constitution and created a limited exception from criminal liability under state law (as opposed to federal law) for seriously ill persons who are in need of marijuana for specified medical purposes and who obtain and use medical marijuana under the limited, specified circumstances described in Amendment 20. 
(2)  The intent of Amendment 20 is to enable certain specified persons who comply with the registration provisions of the law to legally obtain, possess, cultivate, grow, use and distribute marijuana without fear of criminal prosecution under state law. 
(3)  Despite the adoption of Amendment 20, marijuana is still a controlled substance under state and federal law. As a result, making it legal for a person to obtain, possess, cultivate, grow, use and distribute marijuana, even for medical use as contemplated by Amendment 20, has the potential for abuse that should be closely monitored and regulated by local authorities to the extent possible. 
(4)  If not closely monitored and regulated, the presence of marijuana, even for the purposes legally permitted by Amendment 20, can cause an increase in illegal activities within the Town affecting the health, safety, order, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the residents of the Town. 
(5)  If medical marijuana establishments operating pursuant to Amendment 20 were allowed to be established and to operate without appropriate local regulation of their location, medical marijuana establishments might be established in areas that would conflict with the Town's comprehensive land use plan; be inconsistent with surrounding uses; or otherwise be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(6)  Nothing in this Article allows a person to: 
a.  Engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance; 
b.  Possess, cultivate, grow, use or distribute marijuana for any purpose other than for use as medical marijuana as authorized and limited by Amendment 20 and the implementing state statutes and administrative regulations; 
c.  Possess, cultivate, grow, use or distribute marijuana that is otherwise illegal under applicable law; or 
d.  Engage in any activity related to the possession, cultivation, growing, use or distribution of marijuana that is otherwise not permitted under the laws of the Town or the state. 
(7)  This Article is necessary and proper to provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity and improve the order, comfort and convenience of the Town and the inhabitants thereof. 
(8)  No person, business, activity or use that distributed or involved the distribution of marijuana within the Town prior to the enactment of this Article shall be deemed to have been legally established under this Code, and no such person, business, activity or use shall be entitled to claim legal, nonconforming status under any provision of this code or applicable law.

(1)  The owner or operator of any motor home, recreational vehicle or trailer of any sort, other than an authorized emergency vehicle, shall not park said vehicle or trailer on a public roadway, alley or right-of-way, designated for parking, for longer than seventy-two (72) hours total within a period of seven (7) consecutive days.

(b)  By special review of the Board of Trustees, an owner of real property may annually file a petition to be exempted from this restriction on his or her property. 
(1)  The primary basis for granting the exemption will be that the impact of the parking on the neighbors and neighborhood is minimal. Thus, parking of truck tractors on large lots on an infrequent basis, when they are not left to idle, and when they generally enter and leave the property between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., are issues of importance in determining whether an exemption should be granted. 
(2)  Because neighborhoods are in a constant state of flux, all exemptions will expire one (1) year from the date they are issued. 
(3)  The Board of Trustees may designate specific guidelines to the Town's staff through which these exemptions may be granted on an administrative basis. 
(4)  Subject to the provisions set forth herein and Chapter 16 of this Code, the applications for use by special review must be submitted before March 1, 2001. Upon submission, public notice shall be given and the matter set for hearing before the Board of Trustees without first being heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission. No applications will be accepted where more than one (1) truck tractor would be parked on any parcel of land or multiple adjoining parcels owned collectively or individually by related persons or controlled entities. The use by special review, when issued, will be in effect for one (1) year and will automatically expire at the end of a thirty-day grace period following the end of the one-year time period. If the use by special review expires or it is revoked because the conditions upon which the use by special review have not been met, the application cannot be resubmitted. The use by special review is not transferable or assignable. 
(Ord. 431 §4, 2001; Ord. 481 §1, 2003) 
Sec. 8-2-50. - Use of Jake Brakes prohibited. 
    It is unlawful for any person to use within the Town limits a device which is commonly called a Jake Brake, such device having been determined by the Board of Trustees to cause an unreasonable and unnecessary noise, and such device is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. A Jake Brake is that device which is normally used on a truck or other vehicle for slowing or stopping such vehicle by reducing the engine compression, and is sometimes referred to as an engine brake.

Whenever a police officer finds an abandoned motor vehicle on any public property within the Town, the police officer may direct an operator to tow the vehicle and place the vehicle in storage in an impound lot. The police officer may make a reasonable effort, as practicable under the circumstances to locate the owner of the vehicle and direct the owner to remove the vehicle. 
(3)  Abandoned motor vehicles on private property. Whenever an owner of private property finds an abandoned motor vehicle on his or her property, the owner may notify a police officer.

If the police officer determines that a public tow will be requested, the police officer may make a reasonable effort, as practicable under the circumstances, to locate the owner of the vehicle and direct the owner to remove the vehicle. The Town shall pay any towing fees, and the owner of the vehicle shall pay any storage fees for a vehicle towed pursuant to this Paragraph. 
(5)  Vehicles with three (3) or more unpaid parking citations. A police officer may direct an operator to tow a vehicle for safekeeping to an impound lot of the Town's choosing if the vehicle has received three (3) or more separate parking citations, and at least three (3) of those citations remain outstanding, or have not been paid in the time required by law. The owner and/or operator of the vehicle shall be liable for any and all towing and/or storage fees as allowed by law for a vehicle towed pursuant to this Section.

Failure to request a hearing within such time shall operate as a waiver of the owner's right to such hearing.

Sec. 8-3-60. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  A hearing shall be conducted before the Town Administrator within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt by the Town Clerk of the owner's written demand therefor unless the owner agrees to waive the right to a speedy hearing, or the delay in conducting a speedy hearing was occasioned by the owner. Saturdays, Sundays and Town holidays shall be excluded from the calculation of the seventy-two-hour period. The sole issue at the hearing shall be whether there was probable cause to tow and impound the vehicle. 
(b)  Probable cause to tow and impound means such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that the towing and impoundment of the vehicle was warranted because of a breach of the ordinances of the Town or of state or federal law, or because of an emergency. 
(c)  At the hearing, the owner and the Police Department shall each provide testimony or arguments concerning whether there was probable cause to tow and impound the vehicle. The decision of the Town Administrator shall in no way affect any judicial proceeding relating to the vehicle or its owner.

(Ord. 481 §1, 2003) 
Sec. 10-1-30. - Local question. 
    It is the intention of the Board of Trustees that the provisions of this Chapter deal with matters of "local" and "mixed" state and local concern and that no provision of this Chapter is to be construed expressly or by implication to permit conduct that is illegal under the laws of the State or to prohibit conduct that is expressly permitted by the laws of the State. The provisions of this Chapter are to be construed to apply to misdemeanors and other minor and petty offenses only and are not to be interpreted to apply to conduct that is defined as a felony under the laws of the State.

It is the intent of the Board of Trustees to extend the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipal Court as widely as possible. However, where specific sections of this Chapter require that the violation occur "within the Town," then the offense is limited to the territorial limits of the Town. 
(Ord. 481 §1, 2003)

(b)  Transferring irrigation water rights from original agricultural usage to a municipal usage involves resolution of issues of return water flows and consumptive use. When water is applied to an agricultural field, a certain percentage of water is actually used by the plant or evaporated into the atmosphere - this water is considered consumed or used up (i.e., consumptive use). The remaining water either returns to the natural stream through surface runoff or shallow percolation - this water is considered return flow. 
(c)  The amount of consumptive use that is beneficially used by a water right holder is the limit of a saleable water right and is a function of various factors, including historic crop planted, the location, the type of soil and the method used to irrigate the property. 
(d)  Tables contained in the Fee Schedule provide a basic guideline and starting point for negotiations between developers, landowners and Town staff. In general, alternative raw water rights will only be considered for a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the development's overall water requirements. Consideration and negotiations for alternative raw water rights and C-BT water rights will be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Town's overall water right desires.

b.  That service disconnection may be avoided by paying the amount of the delinquency that resulted in the notice, plus any interest charges and late fees as applicable; 
c.  The date on or after which utility service will be disconnected. Utilities will be disconnected by the third business day after the 24th. Payment in full must be received by 5:00 p.m. on the 24th business day in order to avoid disconnection. 
(2)  Utility service shall be disconnected only between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
(3)  Should utility service be disconnected, a reconnection will not be provided until the second business day after payment. 
(4)  The disconnection fee is listed in the accepted Fee Schedule. 
(5)  Payment arrangements cannot be negotiated. 
(6)  Payment arrangements are possible for advance payments (i.e., if a customer will be out of town for an extended period of time - payment can be made in advance of the typical billing cycle and create a credit on the account. Another example would be if a customer wishes to make multiple payments within the billing period - ensuring that the total amount of payment has been paid by the required date). 
(Ord. 570 §2, 2007) 
Sec. 13-2-820. - Reconnection of water service. 
    Once utility service has been disconnected under the provisions of Section 13-2-450, 13-2-460 or 13-2-810 above, there shall be a charge to reconnect water service. It shall be reconnected only by receipt of the amount to be paid pursuant to Paragraph 13-2-810(1)a above, plus payment of the reconnection charge as listed in the accepted Fee Schedule. 
(Ord. 570 §2, 2007) 
Sec. 13-2-825. - Unauthorized reconnection fee. 
    If the water service has been turned on prior to the Town's reconnection of water service to a property there shall be a one-hundred-dollar fee assessed for tampering with the meter. This fee shall be due and payable by the owners of the property, jointly and severally, prior to the reconnection of the property to the Town's water system. In the event of an emergency involving the health or safety of the occupants of the dwelling, the payment of this fee may be delayed or reduced in the reasonable discretion of the Town Administrator or his or her designee. In the event there is a second reconnection required to the same property, if owned by one (1) or more of the same parties, the reconnection fee shall be assessed pursuant to Section 13-2-820 above, plus a two-hundred-dollar tampering fee. In the event there is an unauthorized reconnection, three (3) or more times, each subsequent reconnection fee shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00). The Town may condition providing water service to residents who have made unauthorized reconnections or have been untimely in the payment of their water or wastewater fees upon the advance deposit with the Town of up to six (6) months' utility fee. This deposit may be refunded in whole or in part upon the timely payment of the utility fee for one (1) year. 
(Ord. 605 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 13-2-830. - Lien on property. 
    Every utility charge shall be a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land and buildings where the service is used from the time the charge becomes due until paid. In the event any charge is not paid when due, the Town may, in addition to or in lieu of initiating a disconnection of service or pursuing other remedies, certify any delinquent charge to the County Treasurer, to be collected and paid over by the County Treasurer in the same manner as though it were part of the general property taxes on the property. Such lien may also be enforced by the Town by action at law or suit. In case the tenant in possession of the lot or parcel of land or building pays the charge, the property owner shall be relieved from the lien, and the Town shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the property owner for the payment of any water charge. The failure of any owner to learn that the owner purchased property against which a lien for utility service exists does not affect the owner's liability for payment in full and is not a basis for any claim of any kind whatsoever against the Town for refusing to turn on service until the charges have been paid in full. For the purposes of this Chapter, charge includes all fees, charges and interest established by this Article.

(f)  Emergency Disconnection. At the Department's discretion, discontinuing or severing the service connection on the Owner's property to isolate the possible contaminants will be performed if the degree of hazard warrants such action in order to protect the Town's potable water supply. Discontinuance of service may be summary, immediate and without written notice whenever, in the judgment of the Department, such action is necessary to protect the Town's potable water supply or the distribution system. 
(g)  Failure to Comply.

Failure to allow access by the Owner, or those designated by him or her, to premises for inspection by the Department will result in the automatic classification of the premises as a high hazard risk to the Town's potable water supply. Appeal of any notice or emergency disconnection shall be directed to the Town of Milliken's Administrator. An appeal shall not stay the execution of the Failure to Comply order or disconnection or discontinuation by the Department in order to protect the Town's potable water supply. The Failure to Comply Order may be reversed if the appeal is upheld. 
(h)  Administrative Inspections. The Owner shall allow their property to be inspected for possible cross-connections and shall follow the provisions of the Department's program and the Commission's Regulations if a cross-connection is permitted. Failure to comply with an inspection request may result in discontinuation of water service until such time as the Owner complies. 
(i)  If the Department requires that the public supply be protected by containment, the Owner shall be responsible for water quality beyond the outlet end of the containment device and should utilize fixture outlet protection or such other protective measures as will comply with applicable cross control connection standards for that purpose. 
(j)  Disconnection of water service. With the exception of emergency disconnection as set forth in subsection (f) above, the Department's disconnection of water service under this Article shall substantially comply with the procedures set forth in Section 13-2-810 provided that the written notice of disconnection to the Owner shall include the basis for the disconnection, the manner in which the disconnection may be avoided, and the date on or after which utility service will be disconnected. 
(k)  Record Keeping. 
(1)  The Department shall maintain records of all backflow device inspections and test results for a minimum of three (3) years for community water systems; and, for a minimum of five (5) years for non-community water systems. 
(2)  The Department must maintain each annual backflow prevention and cross-connection control program report for a minimum of three (3) years for community water systems; and, for a minimum five (5) years for non-community water systems.

Such backflow device expenses shall include, but not be limited to installation, maintenance, protection, testing, repair, removal or replacement of said device as required by the Department as a condition of service. 
(b)  Backflow Device. The Owner or those occupying any premises shall not bypass, disable, remove or modify any backflow device without written consent by the Department. Any such modifications shall result in discontinuation or termination of service in substantial conformance to the provisions of Section 13-2-810 of this Article. 
(c)  Fire Suppression System Design and Installation. The Owner or those designated by him or her will comply with current National Fire Protection Association (N.F.P.A.) standards and/or current Public Works Department Design and Construction Specifications latest version when designing, installing and maintaining any fire suppression system as a condition of service.

The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(b)  Civil Penalties. Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any provision of this Code, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued thereunder, may be fined a civil penalty in an amount up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for each violation/offense, pursuant to the authority of 25-8-608(1) C.R.S., as amended, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the "Clean Water Act". Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the Town may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this Code or orders, rules, regulations and permit issued pursuant to this Code. 
(c)  Criminal Penalties. 
(1)  A user who discharges any pollutant into the Town's Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) commits criminal pollutions if such discharge violates any provision of this Code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, and the discharge is made: 
a.  With criminal negligence or recklessly, in which case the user shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days for each violation, or both such fine and imprisonment; or, 
b.  Knowingly or intentionally, in which case the user shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment, or both such fine and imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days for each violation. 
(2)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Code, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Code shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months or both. 
(3)  If two (2) separate offenses under this Code occur in two (2) separate occurrences during a period of two (2) years, the maximum fine for the second offense shall be double the amounts specified in Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this Subsection. 
(4)  Performance Bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Code, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Town, in a sum not to exceed the value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(5)  Liability Insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Code, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(6)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this Code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply with the Code. 
(7)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the Town. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the Town held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the direction of the director. 
(d)  Enforcement. The remedies provided for in this Code are not exclusive. The director, directly or through judicial processes, or both, may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Town's Industrial Pretreatment Program; however, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

CHAPTER 16 
Land Use Code 
ARTICLE II - Community Design Principles and Development Standards 
Division 1 - General 

Sec. 16-2-10. - General provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. All development applications and building permit applications shall comply with the applicable standards contained in this Article. 
(b)  Relation to Zone District Standards (Section 16-3-490 of this Code). In the event of a conflict between a standard or requirement contained in Section 16-3-490 and this Article, the standard in Section 16-3-490 shall prevail. 
(Ord. 480 §2.1, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-15. - Vision and intent. 
(a)  The intention of the Town of Milliken in enacting this Article is to clearly describe the Town's vision and to create a vital, cohesive, well-designed community in order to enhance its small-town character and further the citizens' goals as identified in the Milliken Comprehensive Plan ("Comprehensive Plan"). 
    . . . Visions for Community is an attempt to bring into the city a new form of urban design, one which predicts a shift in the ways a community attempts to consider its physical city, its environment, its traditions, ritual life and mores and how they all cohere into patterns we call city. This "new" form of urban design is in truth quite old. It reflects one of humankind's most primordial activities - the making of "space" into "place." It is considered new in this particular time because it is counter to the way cities have evolved during the twentieth century, by responding to the marketplace. It is considered new because it emphasizes "community" as its guiding imperative instead of economic gain, and "vision" as its principal operative rather than opportunism. 
    -Dallas Visions for Community,Dr. Gail Thomas 
(b)  The Town has many attributes, but its greatest source of pride is its small-town character. This character is readily apparent and forms the foundation of the community. As the Town grows, the elements that contribute to this character must be strengthened and nurtured. As part of the comprehensive planning process, the citizens of the Town described these elements and their collective intentions for development of the community. Their vision and intentions are outlined below: 
(1)  Community. 
a.  The Town will continue to be peaceful, quiet and safe with citizens who know, respect and care for each other and have a general concern for the community as a whole. 
b.  Milliken will continue to be a wonderful place to raise a family. Residents will represent a broad diversity of people in terms of age, income, interests and activities. Special attention will be given to the youth and seniors of the community. 
c.  The Town's western and cultural heritage needs to be preserved through historic preservation efforts of its significant buildings and cultural events. 
d.  The architectural styles used for new businesses will provide interesting, high-quality buildings while maintaining the small-town charm of Milliken. 
e.  The development of new schools in the Town, as demand warrants, will be an important component of providing exceptional educational opportunities to the youth in the community. 
f.  A spirit of cooperation will be fostered with the surrounding communities and the County. 
(2)  Housing. 
a.  Neighborhoods will each have unique character and will be designed with pedestrian access and linkages to parks, schools, public facilities, downtown, commercial areas and the Milliken trail system. 
b.  Additional variety of housing types will be available to reflect the diversity within the community. New development will include varying housing types, such as: single-family homes, row houses, small clusters of multi-family units and apartments, terraced town homes, senior housing and some manufactured homes. The diversity of product types available will accommodate a variety of lifestyles and income levels. 
c.  New residential developments will reflect the diversity of existing neighborhoods and incorporate a variety of housing styles and types. Large-scale, "cookie-cutter" developments will not be allowed. 
d.  Affordable housing will be dispersed among the mixture. 
e.  Incentives will be investigated in order to upgrade existing housing that is in need of repair. 
(3)  Public facilities. 
a.  Educational opportunities for all ages will be provided in many of the parks and public facilities throughout the community. 
b.  The development of a new Community Center will be pursued to provide a pool, recreation and cultural center, fine arts theater and outdoor concert facility. 
c.  The Thompson River corridor will be developed as a primary greenway over time, in order to highlight the scenic corridor and provide recreational opportunities. 
d.  New development will pay for its infrastructure costs and required services. 
e.  There must be adequate capacity in water and wastewater facilities prior to approval of new development. Water storage will be achieved without causing unnecessary negative visual impact. 
f.  Convenient public transit will ultimately be made available to nearby urban areas. This includes the possibility of a connection to the commuter rail system that may one day be built between Fort Collins and Denver. 
(4)  Environment. 
a.  The natural environment, the Town's most distinguishing feature, will be preserved and integrated into all aspects of community design. Special attention will be given to the design of the Town's entryways, as well as open space preservation at the outskirts of the Town limits. 
b.  Development will not be allowed on the bluffs, which are located north of the Big Thompson River and along ridgelines. 
c.  New developments will be built in harmony with the natural environment and take into consideration the physical constraints of the site, as well as aesthetic and ecological values of the land. Steep hillsides, drainageways and riparian areas will be protected. 
(5)  Economic vitality. 
a.  Downtown redevelopment will be an ongoing process to continue to strengthen the core community as an activity center and economic base. 
b.  Incentives will be investigated to encourage the development and expansion of local businesses in order to continue to create jobs within the community so that people can work and live in Town. 
c.  The Town's economic vitality will be achieved by allowing appropriate new development that enhances the community as a visitor destination and encourages small local businesses to thrive. A strong economy, combined with creative funding strategies, will enable the Town to invest in a number of desired amenities. 
(c)  Overall, Milliken will continue to be a wonderful place to call "home," with an unsurpassed quality of life. 
(Ord. 480 §2.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-20. - Application of community design principles. 
(a)  The community design principles as set forth in this Article are to be considered in every development proposal. The Town's goal is to expedite the planning review process by clearly outlining the Town's expectations for new development. To this end, the Planning Commission invites applicants to participate in a visioning meeting prior to preparing the sketch plan application (refer to Section 16-4-160 of this Code. The visioning meeting is an initial meeting between the developer and the Planning Commission. It is intended to begin a collaborative process to ensure that new development is consistent with the community's goals and that issues are identified early in the process. 
(b)  The Planning Commission and Board of Trustees will evaluate each proposal based on these principles and the context within which a project is located. The principles are intended to be specific enough to guide development, but not to preclude creative design solutions. Applicants must substantially conform to the design principles unless it can be demonstrated that an acceptable alternative meets one (1) or more of the following conditions: 
(1)  The alternative better achieves the stated intent; 
(2)  The intent will not be achieved by application of the principle in this circumstance; 
(3)  The effect of other principles will be improved by not applying the principle; and/or 
(4)  Strict application or unique site features make the principle impractical. 
(Ord. 480 §2.3, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-25. - Design elements. 
    One (1) of the greatest challenges facing small towns is the successful integration of new development with the original Town pattern. Suburban development patterns which have included numerous cul-de-sacs and limited street connections have often separated communities and created enclaves of the original towns. In order to maintain the Town's unique, small-town character and clearly describe the Town's vision, the following design elements have been set forth within this Article. 
(1)  Compact Urban Growth. As the community grows from the original Town limits, it is important to maintain a continuity of density, diversity and interconnectedness. Urban development should occur adjacent to the Town's core so that the community's prime agricultural land and natural areas are preserved and public infrastructure and utilities are used as efficiently as possible. 
(2)  Neighborhood Design. New developments should help create neighborhoods, rather than residential subdivisions adjacent to one another. Neighborhoods should be organized around a strong center, which may include elements such as common open space, civic and commercial or mixed uses. Strong consideration should be given to pedestrian movement, the character of streets and sidewalks as inviting public space, and the interconnectedness of the streets within the neighborhood and as they connect to the rest of the community. In addition, new neighborhoods should have a variety of housing sizes and types that help to create a distinct identity rather than a monotonous replication of styles. 
(3)  Lots and Blocks, Streets and Sidewalks. The layout of lots and blocks should be designed to continue the Town's existing block pattern to form a grid or modified grid pattern that is adapted to the topography, natural features and environmental considerations. The streets should be tree-lined and interconnected in order to create a comprehensive transportation network that facilitates the movement of pedestrians, cars and bicycles. 
(4)  Parks and Open Space. New developments shall use natural open spaces and developed public space (such as parks and plazas) to organize and focus lots, blocks and circulation patterns, protect natural areas and quality agricultural land and create an identity for each neighborhood. 
(5)  Site Design, Architecture and Landscaping. One (1) of the fundamental intentions of this Code is to encourage innovative, quality site design, architecture, and landscaping in order to create new places that can be integrated with the existing community and reflect the traditional patterns of the region. The photographic Design Vocabulary (Section 16-2-835 of this Article) as well as illustrations throughout the Code are intended to provide a visual description of the Town's design intentions. 
(6)  Environment. New developments should be designed to fit within the environment. To the greatest extent feasible, sites should be designed to preserve natural areas and the plants and wildlife inhabiting those areas. In addition, new developments are encouraged to follow Green Builder Guidelines (see Subsection 16-2-815[c] of this Article) and to conserve natural resources, especially water. 
(7)  Water Conservation. As the State grows, increasing pressure will be placed on the limited supply of water resources. Milliken residents have emphasized the importance of preserving the quality and quantity of water. All new development is encouraged to use raw water for irrigation and to incorporate water-saving measures in building design and landscaping. Developments are required to use stormwater management techniques that address water quality as well as quantity. 
(Ord. 480 §2.4, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-30. - Compact urban growth. 
(a)  Intent. The Town has adopted a compact urban growth policy that encourages and directs development to take place within areas contiguous to existing development in the community. This policy will accomplish several goals, including: 
(1)  Improving air quality by reducing vehicle miles traveled and by promoting alternatives to the private automobile; 
(2)  Preserving natural areas and features, particularly in the periphery of the Town; 
(3)  Making possible the efficient use of existing infrastructure and cost-effective extensions of new services; 
(4)  Encouraging in-fill development and reinvestment in built-up areas of the Town; and 
(5)  Promoting physical separation from neighboring communities to help each maintain its individual identity and character. 
(b)  General Provisions. 
(1)  The Town has established a Planning Area Boundary and adopted a cooperative planning area policy with Weld County and the Town of Johnstown. The purpose is to direct growth within the established Planning Area Boundary. No development shall be approved unless it is located within the established Planning Area Boundary and is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Exceptions to this policy may be considered at the discretion of the Board of Trustees if it can be demonstrated that the development will provide an exceptional benefit to the Town. 
(2)  The Town has established land use overlay districts (not analogous with zoning districts) within the Planning Area Boundary to ensure that the community grows in a way that enhances its special qualities and maintains a continuity of density, diversity and interconnectedness: 
a.  Downtown Mixed-Use: Allows for a transition to mixed-use development within the Downtown area. 
b.  Ridge Line Preservation District: Limits development on ridge lines. 
These districts are to be used as a general guide in conjunction with the underlying land use designations on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map. 
(c)  Town Structure. Town structure shall be formed by the clustering of neighborhoods, as opposed to developing single-use residential subdivisions adjacent to and disconnected from each other. The clustering of neighborhoods to support the original Town Center and form additional multi-neighborhood centers is illustrated on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map. The original downtown needs to be strengthened by commercial and mixed-use development within the immediate vicinity, as illustrated. 
(Ord. 480 §2.5, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-35. - Neighborhood design principles. 
    We have become so used to living among surroundings in which beauty has little or no place that we do not realize what a remarkable and unique feature the ugliness of modern life is. Both in this country and in may others, wherever one finds a street or part of a street dating from before what we may call the modern period, one is almost sure to see something pleasing and beautiful in its effect. ...It is the lack of beauty, of the amenities of life, more than anything else which obliges us to admit that our work of town building in the past century has not been well done. 
    - Town Planning in Practice, 
Raymond Unwin, 1909 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this Section is to encourage the creation of viable neighborhoods that interconnect with each other and integrate new projects into the existing community, thereby strengthening the original Town. The neighborhood layout should consider the street, lot and block pattern of the original Town, as well as solar orientation, topography, sensitive wildlife and vegetation, drainage patterns and environmental and regional climate issues. Further, the edges of neighborhoods should be formed by features shared with adjacent neighborhoods, such as major streets, changes in street pattern greenways or natural features such as streams and major drainage or riparian corridors. New streets, bikeways, sidewalks, paths, and trails should connect to existing adjacent neighborhoods. 
(b)  Neighborhood Structure. Following is a summary of essential elements to consider integrating into new neighborhoods: 
(1)  Street, sidewalk and trail connections within new neighborhoods that connect to adjacent existing neighborhoods and strengthen the connection to the existing Town. 
(2)  Streets that encourage pedestrian activity by creating an inviting atmosphere through attention to the details of landscaping and tree locations, sidewalks, lighting and the building architecture, etc. 
(3)  A mixed-use neighborhood center located for easy access. 
(4)  A variety of housing types, sizes, densities and price range that are well integrated. 
(5)  A variety of land uses that are well-integrated and a transition of intensity. Nonresidential uses, larger buildings and attached multi-family housing should be encouraged to be located near commercial centers with a transition to smaller buildings closer to low-density neighborhoods. 
(6)  Pedestrian and bike connections throughout residential neighborhoods and linked to neighborhood commercial or civic centers and open space systems. 
(7)  Parks, open space, public plaza and greens that are the focus of and well-integrated into the neighborhood. 
(8)  Street trees placed in new developments at regular intervals of forty (40) feet and placed directly adjacent to sidewalks. See Figure 2-19 at Section 16-2-460 of this Article. 
(9)  Architectural, landscaping and site design elements of new developments as outlined in this Article. 
(c)  General Provisions. The following principles are contained in the original "downtown" of Milliken. a The Comprehensive Plan identifies them as contributing to the community's small-town character. Although the size of individual development proposals will vary, projects will be evaluated with consideration to these neighborhood design principles and the context within which a project is located. Failure to incorporate these design principles into a project may be cause for denial of the project by the Board of Trustees. 
(1)  Each Neighborhood Has a Center and an Edge. It is important that every neighborhood have activity centers that draw people together. Use natural and manmade features such as a drainageway, major roadways and ditches, to define neighborhood edges. Buildings or other features located at gateways entering a neighborhood shall mark the transition into and out of the neighborhood in a distinct fashion using massing, additional height, contrasting materials and/or architectural embellishments to obtain this effect. 
(2)  Mix of Types of Dwelling Units. A mix of dwelling unit types shall be distributed throughout the development. (Refer to Division 6 of this Article for additional housing requirements and Section 16-2-835 of this Code for illustrations of housing styles that the Town is encouraging.) 
(3)  Focal Points. Focal points, or points of visual termination, shall generally be occupied by more prominent, monumental buildings and structures that employ enhanced height, massing, distinctive architectural treatments or other distinguishing features, as well as landscape features. See Figure 2-1. 

Figure 2-1 
(4)  Public Space as Development Framework. Public space is used to organize blocks and circulation patterns and to enhance surrounding development. Public open space must be functional and easily accessible and shall be designed to organize the placement of buildings to create an identity for each neighborhood. Buildings should face public open space to allow for casual surveillance. 
(5)  Design Streets as Public Spaces. 
a.  Buildings shall define streets through the use of relatively uniform setbacks along each block. The streetscape shall also be reinforced by lines of shade trees planted in the right-of-way landscape strip and may be further reinforced by walls, hedges, landscaping or fences which define front yards. (Refer to 16-2-835 of this Article for illustrations of streetscapes.) 
b.  On a lot with multiple buildings, those located on the interior of the site shall relate to one another both functionally and visually. A building complex may be organized around features such as courtyards, greens or quadrangles, which encourage pedestrian activity and incidental social interaction. Smaller, individualized groupings of buildings are encouraged. Buildings shall be located to allow for adequate fire and emergency access. 
(6)  Order Rather Than Repetition. The orderly arrangement of design elements can unify a space even when the elements are not the same. The location of sidewalks relative to streets, building setbacks and orientation, and the placement of trees can all help create an overall impression of unity even though each home or building has a distinct character. 
(7)  Use Human Proportion. Buildings shall be considered in terms of their relationship to the height and massing of adjacent buildings, as well as in relation to the human scale. (In a small town, this means generally one-story, two-story and three-story buildings.) 
(8)  Define the Transition Between the Public and Private Realm. Buildings shall be located to front towards and relate to public streets or parks, both functionally and visually, to the greatest extent possible. Wherever possible, buildings shall not be oriented to front towards a parking lot. 
(9)  Encourage Walking and Bicycling. Sites shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. Pedestrian and bicycle access and connections shall be designed to make it safe and easy to get around on foot and by bicycle. 
(10)  Neighborhoods Shall Have a Mix of Activities Available Rather Than a Purely Residential Land Use. Neighborhood residents shall have convenient access to parks, schools, open space, trails and services. The optimum size of a neighborhood is one-quarter (1/4) mile from center to edge. 
(11)  Fit Within the Environment Rather Than on Top of It. New developments shall be designed to respond to the natural environment, fit into the setting and protect scenic view corridors. Key design considerations shall include a site layout that responds to natural features both on- and off-site, the size of structures and materials used in the development and the transition between the development and the surrounding landscape. 
(12)  Encourage a Range of Residents in Every Neighborhood. Housing types and the size of lots shall be varied to enable people to remain in the neighborhood as their needs change. (Refer to Section 16-2-835 of this Article for illustrations of architectural styles that the Town is encouraging.) 
(13)  Housing Types and Styles That Reflect the Architecture of the Region. Familiar architectural styles shall play an important role in developing an architectural identity for neighborhood dwellings. New homes shall be designed consistent with the architectural principles outlined in Division 6 of this Article. 
(Ord. 480 §2.6, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-40. - Lots and blocks. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of the block and lot standards is to continue Milliken's existing block pattern in a manner that is compatible with site-specific environmental conditions. 
(b)  General Provisions. 
(1)  Blocks (Exclusive of Rural Subdivisions). Streets shall be designed to create blocks that consider interconnectedness, topography, solar orientation, views and other design features. The length of blocks in "Old Town" is typically four hundred (400) feet. (Refer to Figure 2-3 for an example.) Thus, to the greatest extent possible, blocks shall be designed to have a length of between three hundred (300) feet and seven hundred (700) feet (nonresidential streets). The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the following: 
a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
b.  Need for convenient access, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation. 
c.  Limitations and opportunities of topography.

MILLIKEN OLD TOWN 
Figure 2-3 
(2)  Lot Dimension and Configuration. 
a.  Lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation and minimum building setback lines shall conform to Article III of this Chapter and shall facilitate the placement of buildings with sufficient access, outdoor space, privacy and view. 
b.  Depth and width of properties shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking, landscaping and loading areas required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
c.  Lot Frontage. All lots shall have frontage that is either adjacent to or directly accessible to a street. Street frontage shall typically not be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the lot depth. Flag lots are prohibited unless otherwise approved by the Board of Trustees. 
d.  Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to accommodate side elevation enhancements, such as porches and bay windows, the required building setback and utility easements on both street frontages. For a corner lot, the front of the lot is defined as the side having the shortest street frontage. In the case of a reverse corner lot, both sides abutting a street shall maintain a front yard setback. See Figure 2-4. 

Figure 2-4 
e.  Double Frontage. Double frontage lots for residential shall not be permitted except where essential to provide separation of residential properties from arterial streets or commercial uses, or to overcome specific disadvantage of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet in width, across which there shall be no vehicular right of access, may be required along the property line of lots abutting an arterial or other disadvantageous use. See Figure 2-5. 

Figure 2-5 
f.  Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to road right-of-way lines or centerlines. 
g.  Residential Lots Adjacent to Arterial Streets. When residential lots are adjacent to, and the houses do not face, an arterial street (i.e., rear yards abut the street), they shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet deep and direct access to the street shall be prohibited, except for nonconforming situations on unplatted parcels. The setback to the house shall be a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet. When houses face the arterial street or are side-loaded relative to the street, the front or side setback to the house, respectively, shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet. These setbacks do not apply for mixed-use dwelling units in the MU-C-D and MU-C-H Districts. Additional buffering techniques must also be applied such as those outlined in Section 16-2-480 of this Article. 
h.  Residential Lot Access to Adjacent Street. 
1.  Driveway access to a local or collector street from a single-family detached residential lot shall be limited to one (1) driveway curb cut or driveway access of no greater than twenty (20) feet in width. A circular drive in which each access to the local or collector street is less than ten (10) feet in width, separated by at least thirty (30) feet and which is constructed as an integral part of the overall architectural design of the single family residence, may be considered as a single driveway access. 
2.  Driveway access to a local street from a single-family detached residential lot shall be greater than fifty (50) feet (except for reduced width lots in R-1A and Mixed Use Zones) from the intersection of the local street and a collector street or one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the intersection of the local street and an arterial street, as measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines. 
3.  Driveway access to a collector street from a single-family detached residential lot shall be greater than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the intersection of the collector street and a local street, another collector street or an arterial street as measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines. 
i.  Multi-Family Residential, Commercial, Business and Industrial Lot Access to Adjacent Street. 
1.  Driveway access to a local or collector street from a multi-family residential, commercial, business or industrial lot shall be greater than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from any street intersection as measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines; 
2.  Driveway access to an arterial street from a commercial, business or industrial lot shall be not less than two hundred fifty (250) feet from any intersection on the arterial street, or from another commercial, business or industrial lot's access as measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines, or driveways; or 
3.  At the sole option of the Town, driveway access to a local street, collector street or arterial street from a multi-family residential, commercial, business or industrial lot shall be as determined by a traffic study approved by the Town. 
(Ord. 480 §2.7, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-45. - Address numbering requirement to post. 
    The owner, occupant or lessee of any residence, commercial or industrial structure, to which has been assigned a street address by the Town and/or U.S. Postal Service, must ensure that those assigned numerals are clearly, conspicuously and permanently displayed in a fashion that those passing by, including emergency services personnel, along the street frontage can readily view the correct address. 
(Ord. 541 §1, 2006) 
Division 2 - Street Standards 
    There is magic to great streets. We are attracted to the best of them not because we have to go there but because we want to be there. 
    - Great Streets, Alan B. Jacobs 

Sec. 16-2-110. - Intent. 
    The intent of the street standards is to establish a safe, efficient, attractive transportation system that promotes all modes of transportation and is sensitive to the environment. In the recent past, streets have been designed primarily to promote the efficient movement of traffic. However, streets have multiple functions, as stated in "Performance Streets" (Bucks County, 1980). 
    It was often forgotten that residential streets become part of the neighborhood and are eventually used for a variety of purposes for which they were not designed. Residential streets provide direct auto access for the occupant to his home; they carry traffic past his home; they provide a visual setting, and entryway for each house; a pedestrian circulation system; a meeting place for the residents; a play area (whether one likes it or not) for the children, etc. To design and engineer residential streets solely for the convenience of easy automobile movement overlooks the many overlapping uses of a residential street.

(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-115. - General provisions. 
    The local street system of any proposed development shall be designed to be safe, efficient, convenient and attractive, and consider the use by all modes of transportation that will use the system. Streets should be an inviting public space and an integral part of community design. Local streets shall provide for both intra- and inter-neighborhood connections to knit developments together, rather than forming barriers between them. All streets should interconnect to help create a comprehensive network of public areas to allow free movement of cars, bicycles and pedestrians. 
(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-120. - Street construction and layout. 
(a)  Street Connections. All streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets consistent with the approved Milliken Transportation Master Plan Map. All streets shall be designed to bear a logical relationship to the topography of the land. Intersections of streets shall be at right angles unless otherwise approved by the Town. Street intersections shall be separated by not less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet as measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines. 
(b)  Tree-Lined Streets. All streets shall be lined with trees on both sides, with the exception of rural roads and alleys. 
(c)  Street Layout. The street layout shall form an interconnected system of streets primarily in a grid or modified pattern adapted to the topography, unique natural features, environmental constraints and peripheral open space areas. The street layout shall emphasize the location of neighborhood focus points, other internal open space areas, gateways and vistas. The use of cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access shall be minimized. The integration of traffic-calming features within and adjacent to residential areas shall be utilized when appropriate. To the greatest extent possible, streets shall be designed to have a maximum length of seven hundred (700) feet, from intersection to intersection. 
(d)  Controlling Street Access. A strip of land between a dedicated street and adjacent property shall not be reserved for the purpose of controlling access to such street from such property. 
(e)  Visibility at Intersections. No shrubs, ground cover, berms, fences, structures or other materials or items greater than thirty (30) inches in height shall be planted, created or maintained at street intersections within the site distance triangle. Trees shall not be planted in the site distance triangle. 
(f)  Pedestrian Crossings at Street Intersections and Mid-Block Crossings. Pedestrian crossings shall be accessible to handicapped individuals, and mid-block crossings may be required at the direction of the Board of Trustees. 
(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-125. - Alignment. 
(a)  Horizontal Alignment. Horizontal alignment shall provide for the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists. The street pattern shall be the most advantageous to serve the adjoining areas. When possible, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing and proposed streets. 
(b)  Vertical Alignment. No vertical grade shall be less than four-tenths percent (0.4%) in order to facilitate adequate drainage. The maximum percent of street grade, except as approved by the Town Engineer, shall be five percent (5%). Street grades shall not exceed four percent (4%) for a distance extending at least forty (40) feet in each direction from a street intersection. 
(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-130. - Access and dedication. 
(a)  Access. Access to all subdivisions shall be from a public street system. Driveways shall not be permitted to have direct access to arterials or state highways (principal arterials). 
(b)  Street Right-of-Way Dedication. The full width of right-of-way for all streets being platted must be dedicated to the Town. In cases where the perimeter streets have a portion of the proposed right-of-way on an adjacent property, the following standards will apply: 
(1)  The subdivider shall either: 
a.  Purchase the other one-half (1/2) of the proposed right-of-way property for the Town at the appraised fair market value and then dedicate the right-of-way to the Town; or 
b.  If the landowner of the proposed right-of-way property is unwilling to sell the proposed right-of-way property to the subdivider for its appraised fair market value, pay for the cost of an appraisal for the proposed right-of-way property and legal fees for the Town Attorney to complete the condemnation process. The subdivider may enter into a reimbursement agreement with the Town to recover costs. 
(2)  The subdivider shall finalize an agreement with the Town which guarantees the construction of the street to Town standards. 
(c)  Perimeter Streets. When a street is dedicated which ends on the plat, the street right-of-way must be dedicated to the boundary of the plat. 
(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-135. - Intersections. 
    Intersections shall meet the following requirements unless otherwise approved by the Board of Trustees:

Sec. 16-2-140. - Street names. 
    Names of new streets shall not duplicate names of existing streets. However, new streets which are extensions of, or which are in alignment with, existing streets shall bear the names of such streets. The Town must review and approve all street, park and recreation names. 
(Ord. 480 §2.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-145. - Minimum design standards. 
    The width of street right-of-way and the design of the street it contains shall conform to the minimum standards set forth below. However, additional right-of-way and street width may be required based upon special development requirements, including but not limited to additional parking needs, sight distances and requirements for auxiliary lanes. Street cross-sections and the street designation (arterial, collector, local, rural local) within or adjacent to a development may be modified by the Town upon the recommendation of an approved development traffic study or Milliken Transportation Master Plan.

Division 3 - Parking 

Sec. 16-2-210. - Intent. 
    The intent of this Division is to provide adequate parking for motor vehicles while minimizing the visual impact of parking lots and structures. 
(Ord. 480 §2.9, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-215. - General provisions. 
(a)  Provide off-street parking. In all zone districts, off-street parking facilities for the storage of self-propelled motor vehicles for the use of occupants, employees and patrons of the building or structures hereafter erected, altered or extended shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed. 
(b)  Provide adequate parking. If the use contemplated is not described in the required parking tables, the applicant must demonstrate that the parking as planned will be adequate to serve the needs of the proposed development. 
(c)  Provide additional parking. At the time a property changes use, the applicant must demonstrate that the existing parking is adequate to serve the proposed use. It shall be the responsibility of the new user to provide additional parking if the existing parking does not meet the needs of the proposed use. 
(d)  Surface. All parking and driveway areas and primary access to parking facilities shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete or similar materials. The Board of Trustees, on a case-by-case by basis, may consider grass-crete or similar porous pavement. 
(e)  Integrate parking lots with surroundings. Parking lots shall not dominate the frontage of pedestrian-oriented streets, interfere with designated pedestrian routes or negatively impact surrounding neighborhoods. The pedestrian character of streets and buildings shall be maximized through continuity of buildings and landscape frontage. 
(f)  Location. Parking lots shall be located to the rear or side of buildings or in the interior of a block whenever possible. 
(g)  Landscaping. Parking lots shall be landscaped, screened and buffered as provided in Sections Division 5 and 6 of this Article. 
(h)  Share-access. Where feasible, parking lots shall share access drives with adjacent property with similar land uses. 
(i)  Off-street parking design. Any off-street parking area shall be designed so that vehicles may exit without backing onto a public street unless no other practical alternative is available. Off-street parking areas shall be designed so that parked vehicles do not encroach upon or extend onto public rights-of-way or sidewalks or strike against or damage any wall, vegetation, utility or other structure. 
(j)  Circulation area design. Circulation areas shall be designed to facilitate the safe movement of vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians or impeding the function of the parking area. 
(k)  Lighting. All parking area lighting shall be full cut-off type fixtures. Any light used to illuminate parking areas or for any other purpose shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from nearby residential properties and away from the vision of passing motorists. 
(l)  Shared off-street parking. When there are opportunities to support parking demand through shared off-street parking for compatible uses (such as a movie theater and an office building), a parking study and shared parking agreements shall be used to demonstrate the adequacy of the parking supply as a substitute for standard parking requirements. 
(m)  Adjacent on-street parking in MU-C-D Mixed-Use District. In order to promote a pedestrian scale and encourage a perception of safety in the MU-C-D, Mixed Use District, parking may be satisfied using adjacent on-street parking or shared rear-lot parking areas. A parking study and shared parking agreements shall be used to demonstrate the adequacy of the parking supply as a substitute for standard parking requirements.

(3)  Sidewalk Width. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide along local streets; a minimum of five (5) feet wide along collector streets; and a minimum of ten (10) feet wide along arterial streets. A four-foot detached sidewalk is an acceptable sidewalk alternative if it is approved through the subdivision exception process. Sidewalks adjacent to storefronts in commercial areas shall be ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet in width, or consistent with the average sidewalk width on a block if building in an area with existing sidewalks. 
(4)  Sidewalk Location. Sidewalks shall be located within the right-of-way unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees. 
(5)  Sidewalk Materials. 
a.  The acoustic, thermal, visual and tactile properties of sidewalk paving materials shall be appropriate to the proposed functions of pedestrian circulation. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete, brick, slate, colored/textured concrete pavers, concrete containing accents of brick or some combination thereof that is compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the surrounding buildings. Asphalt shall not be used for sidewalks. 
b.  Sidewalks must be constructed of approved materials of sufficient strength to support light maintenance vehicles. If used as a secondary emergency access, sidewalks must also be able to support a fire truck (60,000 lbs.) Please refer to the Town of Milliken Standards and Specifications for additional sidewalk construction standards. 
(6)  Sidewalk Installation. Sidewalks and related improvements shall be installed or constructed by the subdivider in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Town and, after installation or construction, they shall be subject to inspection and approval by the Town. All required improvements shall be completed in accordance with the officially established grades. 
(7)  Accessibility. Sidewalks and plazas shall be accessible to handicapped individuals. (Refer to Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA] requirements.) 
(8)  Walkways. Walkways through a subdivision block shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width, shall be within a dedicated right-of-way not less than twenty (20) feet in width, and shall be flanked with appropriate landscaping and lighting. Walkways along buildings and within parking lots shall be raised and curbed, where suitable. A direct pedestrian connection to building entries, public space and parking areas shall be provided from public sidewalks. Walkways shall be constructed of the same materials as sidewalks, except that walkways internal to asphalt-surfaced parking lots may be of asphalt construction.

(Ord. 480 §2.10, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-315. - Easement and utility standards. 
(a)  Utility Easement Width. Utility easements shall measure ten (10) feet on each side of abutting rear lot lines. On subdivision perimeter rear lot lines adjacent to unsubdivided property, utility easements shall measure ten (10) feet in width. In the event that the location of utility easements adjacent to rear property lines is unsuitable for use by utility companies due to drainage, irrigation ditches or other obstructions, the subdivider shall provide like-width easements adjacent to said areas of obstruction. Side lot line easements, where necessary, shall measure ten (10) feet in full width; five (5) feet either side of a lot line is acceptable. Front lot line easements shall measure thirteen (13) feet in width. Easements may be more or less than widths stated if the specific utility indicates in writing a width other than those required by this Code. Utility easements shall be subject to the approval of the Town or applicable utility company. 
(b)  Multiple Installations Within Easements. Easements shall be designed so as to provide efficient installation of utilities. Public utility installations shall be located as to permit multiple installations within the easements. The developer will establish final utility grades prior to utility installations. 
(c)  Underground Utilities. Telephone lines, electric lines, cable television lines and other like utility services shall be placed underground. Pedestals and transformers shall not be located in the front yard setback adjacent to public streets, unless they are underground and/or not visible to the traveling public. The subdivider shall be responsible for complying with the requirements of this Section and shall make the necessary arrangements, including any construction or installation charges, with each utility provider for the installation of such facilities. Transformers, switching boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts and other facilities necessarily appurtenant to such underground utilities shall be placed underground. Screening or fencing is required to the satisfaction of the Board of Trustees. Electric transmission and distribution feeder lines and necessary appurtenances thereto may not be placed above ground unless they are carrying greater than 115 kV. Such facilities shall be placed within easements or public streets, as therein provided, or upon private easements or rights-of-way provided for particular facilities. (Refer to Division 2, Street Standards of this Article. Utility easements have been identified outside the right-of-way in order to accommodate the location of street trees.) 
(d)  Street Lighting. Street lighting and associated underground street lighting supply circuits shall be installed. The minimum requirement shall be two-hundred-fifty-watt sodium vapor lamps at a maximum spacing of four hundred (400) feet for local streets. Arterial streets and commercial areas shall have a higher level of lighting as determined by the Board of Trustees. Street lighting shall also comply with Section 16-2-810 of this Article and be approved by the Town prior to installation. 
(Ord. 480 §2.11, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-320. - Parks and open space. 
    The intent is to ensure that a comprehensive, integrated network of parks and open space is developed and preserved as the community grows. 
(Ord. 480 §2.12, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-325. - Types of parks and open space. 
(a)  Plazas. A plaza is typically located in a commercial or industrial area to serve as a gathering place. A plaza is usually bordered by civic or private buildings. Plazas may range from very active places with adjacent complimentary uses such as restaurants and cafes, to quiet areas with only seating, formal landscape plantings and amenities such as fountains or public art. Developers are responsible for developing and providing the appropriate amenities for each plaza. 
(b)  Pocket Parks. 
(1)  Pocket parks provide places within walking distance of residential units for supervised play for young children and unstructured activities for neighborhood residents. Developers must provide the land and develop a one-acre pocket park for every two hundred fifty (250) residential units. At a minimum, a pocket park shall include live ground cover, trees and irrigation plus one (1) of the following: playground equipment, contemplative garden or other active or passive recreation opportunities for the neighborhood, as approved by the Town. 
(2)  Projects with less than two hundred fifty (250) units must provide a pocket park or demonstrate that they are within one-half (1/2) mile of a neighborhood park. If credit is taken for proximity to a neighborhood park, the developer must provide a cash-in-lieu equivalent for its pro rata share of the cost of land and improvements for a pocket park (i.e., provide twenty-five percent [25%] of a pocket park for fifty [50] units), as approved by the Town. 
(3)  The land and amenities of a pocket park may be added to a centrally located neighborhood park. The pocket park amenities placed in a neighborhood park must be within one-half (1/2) mile of the sub-neighborhood's two hundred fifty (250) residences served. For example a neighborhood park serving a neighborhood of five hundred (500) residences shall have two (2) pocket park amenity pods, located to conveniently serve each of the sub-neighborhoods. 
(c)  Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are places for recreation and social gatherings that are within walking distance of most residents. These parks can include multiple-use lawn areas, picnic areas, playground equipment, court game facilities and community gardens. The general locations for each seven (7) to ten (10) acre neighborhood park are shown on the Johnstown/ Milliken Parks ,Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. Every residential development shall either provide land for a neighborhood park or provide a fair share, cash-in-lieu contribution for the park that will serve the neighborhood. This can be credited toward the twenty-percent land dedication required at the time of subdivision. Developers providing land shall submit a conceptual design for the park to demonstrate that it meets the intent of the Johnstown/Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. 
(d)  Community Park. Community parks serve the residents of several neighborhoods. Community parks are to be located on or near arterial streets at the edge of residential areas or in nonresidential areas to minimize the impact of organized recreational activities such as lighted ball fields. The general locations for community parks are shown on the Johnstown/Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. These parks will be purchased and developed by the Town. 
(e)  District Park. District parks serve the residents of the entire Town as well as people who live outside of the community. These parks are located to take advantage of special natural settings. Milliken's district parks are illustrated on the Johnstown/Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. District parks are purchased and developed by the Town. 
(f)  Trails. The trail system shall link neighborhoods, parks, schools, open spaces, employment centers, community facilities and neighboring communities and thus provide important transportation connections, as well as recreational opportunities and access. Developers must provide trails in all areas designated "Parks and Trails" on the Johnstown/Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan, as well as connections to the Town's trail system and destinations within the neighborhood. 
(g)  Regional Open Space. Milliken's regional open space system includes: Town drainage ways, floodplains, natural areas, natural area buffer zones, wetlands, subsidence areas, agriculture preservation areas and lands of archeological or historic significance. Access is generally limited to trails, educational signs and similar improvements. 
(h)  Storm Drainage Facilities. Storm drainage facilities, including stormwater detention and stormwater retention ponds, may function as open space for active recreation, trail corridors or habitat enhancement areas if they are designed appropriately. Credit toward the open space dedication requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Trustees at the time of platting. 
(Ord. 480 §2.12, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-330. - Parks and open space generally. 
(a)  Open Space as Neighborhood Focus. Open space, such as the Town drainage ways and developed parks and plazas, shall be used to organize and focus lot, block and circulation patterns and to enhance surrounding development. Street, block, lot and building patterns shall respond to the views, landscape and recreational opportunities provided by the open space. 
(b)  Public Access. Areas designated as public open space shall be both visibly and physically accessible to the community. Public access shall be provided to all public open space, natural and developed, directly from the public street and trail system. Open space areas shall be bounded along at least fifty percent (50%) of the perimeter by a street, except for pocket parks and plazas, unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees. Pocket parks and plazas shall be integrated into the neighborhood design and be accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists. 
(c)  Buildings to Front Public Open Space. Development adjacent to open spaces shall front onto the area as much as possible, so that the areas are not enclosed by back yards. In the case of rural subdivisions, open space frontage shall be appropriate to the design and character of the development. Open space and trail areas shall have a minimum of three hundred (300) feet of street frontage unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees. 
(d)  Buffering. Appropriate buffering and setbacks shall be used between environmental resources and proposed development to ensure that the proposed development does not degrade the existing habitat. Developers shall provide an open space buffer zone around all natural areas unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees (refer to Section 16-2-815 of this Article for further information about natural area buffer zones). The size of the buffer zone shall be in accordance with studies prepared by the Colorado Division of Wildlife or a qualified wetland/wildlife ecologist employed by the Town and paid for by the developer. 
(e)  Open Space Uses. Uses designated within the open space shall be appropriate to the context and character of the site and the intensity of the proposed development. 
(f)  Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space. Ownership and maintenance of public open space shall be determined by the Town on a case-by-case basis through the review process. 
(1)  Generally, the Town shall own and maintain neighborhood parks, community parks, district parks and public trails. 
(2)  Pocket parks, landscaped outlots and private recreational facilities shall be owned and maintained by a homeowners' association or the landowner. 
(3)  Environmentally sensitive, archaeological and historic resources may be dedicated to the Town and maintained by the Town if approved by the Board of Trustees. 
(4)  Conservation areas set aside as part of a conservation subdivision shall be owned and maintained by the homeowners' association. 
(5)  Stormwater detention and retention areas that function as open space shall be owned and maintained by a homeowners' association or the landowner, unless otherwise approved by the Town. 
(6)  Areas designated as open space shall be maintained according the designated function of the area. Applicants shall work with the National Resources Conservation Service to develop a management plan which addresses: irrigation, revegetation, erosion control and weed management. If the area is to remain in private ownership, a mechanism which will assure maintenance will be funded in perpetuity must be in place at the time of final plat. 
(g)  Open Space Protection. Areas designated as open space shall be protected by a deed restriction or other appropriate method to ensure that they cannot be subdivided or developed in the future and remain open in perpetuity. They may be dedicated to the public or held in private ownership. Appropriate ownership will be determined through the review process in cooperation with the landowner. Future use may include recreational or agricultural activities if approved by the Town. 
(Ord. 480 §2.12, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-335. - Open space requirements. 
(a)  Open space includes: 
(1)  Areas within the community designated for the common use of the residents of an individual development and/or the community at large; 
(2)  Areas designated for preservation and protection of environmental resources, including floodplains, natural drainage ways, wildlife habitat and wetland areas; 
(3)  Areas designated for agricultural preservation; and 
(4)  Areas of archeological and historic significance. 
(b)  Open space shall not include the following: 
(1)  Required setback areas around oil and gas production facilities; 
(2)  Disconnected remnants of land created by division of sites into lots or parcels that do not qualify as functional open space or that preserve environmental resources, unless approved by the Board of Trustees; 
(3)  Private yards; 
(4)  Tree lawns in street rights-of-way; or 
(5)  Required parking lot landscaping associated with all uses, except parking specifically designated for access to open space areas and within commercial/industrial projects. 
(c)  Amount of Open Space Required. The amount of functional open space required in each development will be based on the density of the development, the recreational requirements of the anticipated users and the anticipated opportunities for public recreation within walking distance of the site (one-half [1/2] mile). However, all residential subdivisions shall dedicate a minimum of twelve percent (12%) of the gross land area for public parks, trails, open space or other civic purposes at the time of subdivision. Nonresidential subdivisions shall dedicate seven percent (7%) of the gross land area for public parks, trails, open space and other civic purposes at the time of subdivision. This dedication can be credited toward the overall open space required for the subdivision. As determined by the Board of Trustees, the subdivider shall pay fee-in-lieu of land dedication in those cases where dedication of land is not the preferred alternative. Such payment shall be based on the fair market value of the entire property and the value of the improved open space, to be determined after completion of the platting process. Such payment shall be held by the Board of Trustees for the acquisition of sites and land areas by the Town. At the option of the Board of Trustees, the subdivider may meet the dedication requirements through a combination of fee-in-lieu and land dedication. 
(1)  Rural Subdivision. The developer shall provide a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land being subdivided as functional open space, which may include agricultural land, natural areas, drainage ways, floodplains, subsidence areas, trails and other civic purposes. 
(2)  Rural Subdivision With Density Bonus. The developer shall provide a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the gross land being subdivided as functional open space which may include agricultural land, natural areas, drainage ways, floodplains, subsidence areas, trails and other civic purposes.

Division 5 - Landscaping Standards 
    To exist as a nation, to prosper as a state, and to live as a people, we must have trees. 
    - Theodore Roosevelt 

Sec. 16-2-410. - Intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this Division is to protect and enhance the community's environmental, economic, recreational and aesthetic resources by promoting efficient use of water in the community's public and private landscape, reducing water waste and establishing procedures for the design, installation and maintenance of water-efficient landscapes throughout the jurisdiction. 
(b)  Furthermore, these landscaping standards are intended to promote quality landscape design that: 
(1)  Reinforces the identity of the community and each neighborhood; 
(2)  Provides tree-lined streets in urban areas; 
(3)  Anchors new buildings in the landscape; 
(4)  Provides tree canopies within paved areas; 
(5)  Is environmentally sensitive by preserving existing trees, using water conservation techniques and planting native species (when appropriate), and enhances valuable habitat; 
(6)  Encourages the utilization of xeriscape principles; and 
(7)  Promotes efficient use of water and reduces water waste. 
(Ord. 480 §2.13, 2003; Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-412. - Applicability. 
(a)  This Section applies to all new or renovated landscapes that require development review permits. However, both the standards and/or the submittal requirements may be amended with Town approval when necessary to reflect the individuality of the specific site and development. 
(b)  Please see Section 16-2-490 of this Division for a summary of the landscaping requirements based on development types. 
(c)  An applicant may use the Planned Unit Development zoning and approval process if necessary to amend the regulations to allow for individualized landscapes in connection with unique developments. 
(Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-415. - General provisions. 
    All land development applications shall be accompanied by an appropriate landscape plan. Building permit applications for individual single-family residences will require landscape plans. However, all landscaping within the community shall comply with the intent of these regulations. Any landscaping in place at the time of the adoption of these regulations that does not conform to these regulations will be considered legal nonconforming. However, any legal nonconforming landscaping on commercial, industrial and multi-family developments will be required to comply with these regulations if changes are made to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total landscaped area of the subject property. This twenty-five percent (25%) will be measured from the existing conditions at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified herein and does not allow for repeated changes of less than twenty-five percent (25%) so as to avoid conformity. (Ord. 480 §2.13, 2003; Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
    Trees can transform a street more easily than any other physical improvement. Moreover, for many people, trees are the most important single characteristic of a good street. 
    - Great Streets, Alan B. Jacobs 
Sec. 16-2-420. - Street trees. 
(a)  Landscape improvements in urban settings shall create an orderly, irrigated, managed landscape. All urban neighborhoods shall have tree-lined streets. Street trees shall include a mix of species and be aligned in straight rows. Street trees shall be placed within the right-of-way tree lawn. Spacing of trees shall allow for their mature spread. Trees installed along streets that will be widened in the future shall take into account plans for future widening of streets so that established trees will not be disturbed during future construction. 
(b)  Landscape improvements in rural subdivisions, environmentally sensitive areas and lower-density, rural developments shall be native-looking and informal. Street trees in rural developments shall be planted to create irregular clusters of trees to reinforce the design and character of each project and to frame views. 
(Ord. 480 §2.13, 2003; Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-422. - Soil amendments and mulch. 
(a)  Soil amendments. 
(1)  Addition of proper and adequate soil amendments is required for all plantings. A soil amendment is any material added to improve its physical properties, such as water retention, permeability, water infiltration, drainage, aeration and structure, with the goal of providing a better environment for roots. In addition to helping the plants grow, this addition can also help with successful water conservation. 
(2)  Prior to the installation of turf grass and/or other plant materials in areas to be landscaped, the areas shall be thoroughly loosened, and organic industry-accepted, certified weed-free soil amendment (such as compost, peat or aged manure) shall be thoroughly incorporated (i.e., rototilled) into the soil at a rate of at least four (4) cubic yards of soil amendment per one thousand (1,000) square feet of turf grass and/or area to be planted, to a depth of at least six (6) inches. In addition, prior to installation of any turf grass and/or other planted area, all foreign waste materials, including concrete, plastic, wire and the like, along with rocks larger than three (3) inches, shall be removed from the top six (6) inches of soil. The developer shall affirm and certify, in writing, that the turf grass and/or planted areas have been installed according to these standards or that legally binding commitments have been made to install such soil amendments prior to installation of such turf grass and/or other plant materials. 
(b)  Mulch. 
(1)  All plantable areas not covered with turf shall be covered with a minimum of four (4) inches of a suitable mulch to retain water and inhibit weeds. Nonporous fabrics (like black plastic) shall not be placed under mulches. 
(2)  Mulch shall be of wood-based materials and does not include gravel, rock, grass clippings, straw, hay or leaves. 
(Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-425. - Site landscape design. 
    Landscape improvements shall be an integral part of the overall site design for each property. Landscape improvements shall be designed to complement and enhance the character of neighborhoods and shall follow these guidelines: 
(1)  Landscaped areas shall be configured to maximize their interconnectivity within the site, to natural areas and to landscaped areas in adjacent developments. Small, isolated islands of landscaping should be avoided except as required in parking lots and for screening along roadways. 
(2)  Landscaped areas shall enhance functional open space through the creation of outdoor rooms appropriate to the location and purpose of the open space within the development. This can be accomplished through a combination of plantings, fencing and berms and by using natural features on the site. See Figure 2-16 below. 

Use plantings and berms to create outdoor rooms in common open space areas. 
Figure 2-16 
(3)  Landscape improvements in all developments shall be consistent with the character of the proposed development and the surrounding area to reinforce neighborhood identity. For example, if the theme of the development is prairie grassland then fewer trees will be required while more shrubs and grasses will be necessary. 
(4)  Landscape design shall enhance natural features, drainage ways and environmental resources . 
(5)  All landscape improvements shall be designed for mature landscapes and shall provide appropriate visibility for cars and pedestrians. Landscaping shall be no more than thirty (30) inches high when located in a sight distance triangle. 
(6)  Preserve and frame views both into and out of the neighborhood. 
(7)  Incorporate the elements of gateway, path and destination into the design of landscapes. Gateways are entries that provide transitions from one (1) space to another. Pathways are routes that lead to a destination. Destinations are focal points that can include anything from a garden bench at the end of a path to a civic building at the end of a street. 
(Ord. 480 §2.13, 2003; Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-427. - Water efficiency in landscape design. 
    Landscape improvements shall be designed with water efficiency as a goal. These guidelines shall apply to the design of all regulated landscapes: 
(1)  Landscapes shall use the following xeriscape design principles to facilitate water conservation: 
a.  Well-planned planting schemes. 
b.  Appropriate turf selection to minimize the use of bluegrass. 
c.  Use of mulch to maintain soil moisture and reduce evaporation. 
d.  Grouping of plant materials according to their microclimatic needs and water requirements. 
e.  Improvement of the soil with organic matter if needed. 
f.  Efficient irrigation systems. 
g.  Proper maintenance and irrigation schedules. 
h.  Design of landscaping to help minimize steep grades and reduce water runoff. 
i.  Minimize landscaping in strips less than eight (8) feet wide when necessary, such as between the street and the sidewalk. 
j.  In medians, use of native plants that require low amounts of water and maintenance. 
(2)  Plants shall be selected appropriately based upon their adaptability to the climatic, geologic and topographical conditions of the site. Protection and preservation of native species and natural areas is encouraged. The planting of trees is encouraged wherever it is consistent with the other provisions of this Division. Please see the approved Town Plant Species List. 
(3)  Recirculating water shall be used for decorative water features. 
(4)  With prior written approval of the Town's designated staff, artificial plants, grass and other materials are allowed where they are aesthetically in accord with the neighborhood, of a quality consistent with current state-of-the-art products and in compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
(5)  Refer to Section 13-2-60 of this Code for the Town's watering restrictions. 
(6)  Refer to the Department of Local Affairs Smart Growth Office "Water Wise Landscaping Best Practices Manual" for a list of approved plant species for use as well as other pertinent information to help develop a water-efficient and water-conserving landscape. 
(Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-430. - Landscaping environmental considerations. 
(a)  All landscapes shall strive to maximize the use of native species . Where native material is not appropriate for the intended use or appearance, plant species that are regionally adapted and noninvasive may be used. 
(b)  Landscapes shall consist of a variety of species to enhance biodiversity . No one (1) species may make up more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total non-grass plant materials on the site. 
(c)  Buildings and parking areas shall be located to preserve and promote the health of existing trees, environmental resources and natural drainage ways. No healthy tree shall be removed without good cause. This requirement is not intended to prevent the removal of unhealthy trees in conjunction with site development. 
(d)  Trees shall be located to provide summer shade and limit winter shade on walks and streets. 
(e)  A combination of plantings, berms, walls and fences shall be used as appropriate to buffer sensitive habitat. See Figure 2-17 below. 

Use buffers to protect the physical integrity of riparian ecosystems. Try to preserve vegetation and trees in streamside zone and middle zone. Encourage grass and landscaping in outer zone to filter runoff from backyards, parking areas, roads, etc. 
Figure 2-17 
(f)  Plants shall be selected to blend with the native vegetation for projects at the interface between urban areas and natural open space (nonirrigated). Locally recognized invasive introduced plants shall be unacceptable. Plants with low fuel volume and/or low flammability shall be emphasized. 
(g)  All areas disturbed by construction shall be reseeded to prevent erosion . Erosion mats may be necessary under certain conditions. Native, noninvasive grasses shall be used for revegetation where practical. Weed control is the responsibility of the landowner on all reseeded areas and all preservation areas. 
(Ord. 480 §2.13, 2003; Ord. 607 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-435. - New buildings and paved areas. 
(a)  Anchor structures in the landscape through the use of trees, shrubs and ground cover. The size and intensity of plantings shall be appropriate to the size and context of the improvements. 
(b)  Integrate adjacent land uses of different intensities through a combination of berming, plantings and fencing. Use opaque screening only when necessary to mitigate the impact of noise, light, unattractive aesthetics and traffic. A fence shall not be the only screening material used. See Figure 2-18 below. 

A combination of berming, planting and fencing to integrate land uses. 
Figure 2-18 
(c)  Use landscaping to provide a transition from developed, managed landscape to more natural vegetation.

(Ord. 480 §2.17, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-565. - Front doors. 
(a)  Front doors shall be designed, detailed and located to be a prominent architectural element visible from the street. The door style, scale and trim shall complement the architectural style of the building. 
(b)  When located on a corner lot, the dwelling shall face the street frontage most dominated by residentially used structures, as may be addressed by the address plat, or as designated by the Town Administrator or his or her designee. 
(Ord. 480 §2.17, 2003; Ord. 624 §1, 2010) 
Sec. 16-2-570. - Windows. 
(a)  The window type, composition, proportions and trim for a house shall strongly reflect its architectural style. The use of mountings is encouraged to create a smaller scale.

(Ord. 480 §2.17, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-595. - Garages. 
    Homes, not garages, shall have the emphasis on residential streets. The intent is that residential streets have variety and that garages not dominate homes and streets. Alley-accessed garages are strongly encouraged. All single- and two-family dwellings constructed and placed on land pursuant to issuance of a building permit subsequent to April 9, 2010, shall include a garage (one (1) car in size, or larger), either attached or detached, as part of the new construction or placement and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion. 
(1)  Requirements for Garages with Access from the Street (see Figure 2-25): 
a.  Variety of Garage Placement. Varying the placement of street-accessed garages on adjacent lots is encouraged to create diversity and avoid repetition. 
b.  Projecting Garage Doors. Street-facing projecting garage doors shall be set back at least twenty-two (22) feet from the property line and four (4) feet or more from the forward-most enclosed area of the home.

(4)  There is a provision for utility services and they are accessible. 
(Ord. 507 §1, 2005) 
Sec. 16-2-600. - Town houses and row houses (single-family attached dwellings). 
    Row house groupings rely on the continuity of well-defined architectural elements to establish strong street presence. However, each unit must be expressed so that the composition reads as the sum of the individual parts. 
    Because repetition is important to the composition of the row houses, sufficient articulation of architectural elements on the primary facade of each row house is essential. Groupings of row houses are often repeated along the street, requiring techniques to promote architectural interest and streetscape diversity. 
- Stapleton Design Book published
by Forest City Stapleton, Inc.,
September 2000, pp. III.20 -
III.22 
    The intent of this Section is to build town houses and row houses with architectural designs that relate buildings to the street, and that achieve a harmonious balance between repetition and variety. 
(1)  Individual Dwelling Identity. Repeat principal architectural elements like entries, bays, cornices and parapets. Vary other architectural elements such as the offsetting of building walls, choice of materials, parapet height and color to create visual interest and streetscape diversity. 
(2)  Primary Facade. Design the primary facade of each row house so it is evident where the unit begins and ends. 
(3)  Articulation. A row house articulation is defined as a covered entry element, a dormer facing the street, a horizontal offset of at least two (2) feet in the principal building wall for a minimum of four (4) feet in width, a bay or projection, or a significant change in the parapet height and design. 
a.  The primary row house elevation towards the street shall have at least two (2) articulations, but not more than three (3) articulations. The required articulation refers to an individual row house, not the entire grouping. 
b.  Side elevations of row houses facing a street are subject to the same articulation requirements as the primary facade. 
c.  Row house groupings of six (6) units or more (or groupings over one hundred twenty [120] feet in length) require two (2) different articulation combinations. 
    Well-defined and sensitive entries are particularly important for row house design. In addition to creating a feeling of welcome and providing shelter, they also help make a gracious transition between public and private realms.

(Ord. 480 §2.17, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-605. - Multi-family stacked units, including condominiums and apartments. 
    The intent of this Section is to build multi-family stacked units that achieve a harmonious balance between repetition and variety. Each multi-family dwelling containing more than three (3) dwelling units shall feature a variety of massing proportions, wall plane proportions, roof proportions and other characteristics. The following specific standards shall apply to multi-family stacked units, including condominiums and apartments: 
(1)  Individual Building Identity. For all developments of three (3) or more multi-family stacked buildings, a floor plan may be repeated; however, identical building facades must not be replicated more than twice within the development. Before building may commence on a block and prior to the issuance of a building permit within the block, the applicant shall illustrate, through the use of a block diversity plan, how the development will comply with the requirements set forth in this Section. Final plat approval cannot be given without approval of a block diversity plan for the initial stage of development. A block diversity plan shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  A map that illustrates the floor plan and elevation for each building on the block. 
b.  The color palette to be used. 
c.  A written statement that specifies how provisions (1) through (5) of this Section will be met. 
(2)  Articulation. Each multi-family dwelling or condominium shall be articulated with projections, recesses, covered doorways, balconies, box or bay windows and/or other similar features, dividing large facades and walls into human-scaled proportions. Each multi-family building shall feature walls that are articulated by a least two (2) of any of the following elements within every thirty-six-foot length of the facade: 
a.  Recesses, projections or significant offsets in the wall plane; 
b.  Distinct individualized entrances; 
c.  Chimneys that project from the wall plane; 
d.  Balconies and/or other outdoor living space; or 
e.  Bay or box windows. 
(3)  Roofs. Each multi-family building shall feature a combination of primary and secondary roofs. Primary pitched roofs shall be articulated by at least one (1) of the following elements: 
a.  Changes in plane and elevations; 
b.  Dormers, gables or clerestories; or 
c.  Transitions to secondary roofs over entrances, garages, porches or bay windows. 
(4)  Color. For all developments, there shall be no more than two (2) similarly colored structures placed next to each other along a street or major walkway spine. 
(5)  Garages. No street-facing facade shall contain more than four (4) garage fronts. Resident garages or parking that is internal to the block is encouraged. On-street parking should be made available for visitors. 
(Ord. 480 §2.17, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-610. - Architectural standards for factory built, manufactured and mobile homes. 
(a)  Factory built homes shall be constructed to the local wind and snow loads. 
(b)  Mobile homes must be attached to natural or propane gas distribution piping, electrical distribution wiring and plumbing waste sewer lines on an approved mobile home site designed for such attachment points. 
(c)  No factory built home, manufactured home or mobile homes shall be converted or used, as a storage building. 
(Ord. No. 695 , §4, 6-11-2014) 
Sec. 16-2-611. - Prohibition of deterioration of factory built homes, manufactured homes or mobile homes. 
    No factory built home, manufactured home or mobile home shall be allowed to become in a dilapidated state which includes units that are partially or totally damaged by fire, earthquake, flood, wind or other natural causes, or is in a state of general dilapidation, deterioration or decay resulting from improper lack of maintenance, vandalism or infestation with insects or rodents. Any such dilapidated structure shall be returned to and maintained in the condition as originally established on site and as inspected by the Building Inspection Department, or it shall be removed from site. Repair of non-conforming structures or uses shall be in accordance with non-conforming structure provisions found in the Land Use Code. 
(Ord. No. 695 , §5, 6-11-2014) 
Sec. 16-2-612. - Restrictions on mobile homes. 
    Mobile homes constructed prior to June 15, 1976 which do not comply with the HUD Code are not allowed to be repaired beyond what is allowed through the non-conforming structure provisions of this Code, or to be brought into the Town of Milliken after adoption of this Code reference. 
(Ord. No. 695 , §6, 6-11-2014) 
Division 7 - Commercial and Industrial Architecture 

Sec. 16-2-710. - Intent. 
(a)  The Town has the following three (3) distinctly different commercial/industrial types of development within its Planning Area: mixed use; business/industrial; and business/commercial. They are different in character, purpose and mixture of uses. The design considerations vary for each type, although there are many common design elements. Section 16-2-715 below outlines the common elements, and the specific design considerations are identified by type. 
(b)  With respect to the mixed use, Milliken's historic buildings have established a pattern of downtown development. Buildings are located close to the sidewalk, forming a continuous street facade. Pedestrian movement is the primary focus. Building height, architectural details, front setbacks, parking location, wall articulation and sidewalks establish the architectural edge that defines this area as a walkable commercial corridor. A Mixed Use Commercial - Downtown District has been created to strengthen the original downtown area. 
(c)  The business/industrial is a primary employment center for the community. This area is predominantly automobile-accessible; however one (1) of the design challenges is to improve the pedestrian connections internally and as this area connects to the rest of the community. 
(d)  Finally, business/commercial is intended to be integrated into the design of new neighborhoods to serve as a focal point and meet convenience commercial needs. 
(Ord. 480 §2.18, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-715. - General provisions. 
(a)  Connections. Commercial developments must be linked with surrounding areas by extending town streets, sidewalks and/or paths directly into and through the development, thereby providing convenient, direct pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle access to and from all sides of the development. 
(b)  Accessibility. Developments must be accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists as well as motorists. Site plans shall equally emphasize the following: 
(1)  Pedestrian access to the site and buildings; 
(2)  Gathering areas for people; and 
(3)  Auto access and parking lots. 
The emphasis must not be placed solely on parking and drive-through functions. 
(c)  Walkways. Walkways must be located and aligned to directly and continuously connect areas or points of pedestrian origin and destination, and not be located and aligned solely based on the outline of a parking lot configuration that does not provide such direct pedestrian access. 
(d)  On-Street Parking. Streets and other elements of the site plan shall be designed so that on-street parking is a functional part of the development (except along arterial streets). 
(e)  Building Orientation. Where possible, buildings shall be located to front on and relate primarily to streets. Building setbacks from local and collector streets should be minimized in order to establish a visually continuous, pedestrian-oriented streetfront. In the case of large buildings for employment, storage or auto-related uses, where greater setbacks are needed, a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the building shall be brought to the setback line. If a minimized setback is not maintained, the larger setback area shall have landscaping, low walls or fencing, a tree canopy and/or other site improvements along the sidewalk designed for pedestrian interest, scale and comfort. See Figure 2-26.

Figure 2-26 
(f)  Pedestrian Scale. The establishment of buildings on isolated "pad sites" surrounded by parking lots and driveways, and that offer mainly auto-oriented signage to define entrances, is discouraged. Even relatively massive development can be configured into "blocks" or other spaces, proportioned on a human scale and city block scale; and need not be proportioned on a monolithic, auto-oriented scale. 
(g)  Thematic Architectural Styles. Standardized "corporate" or strongly thematic architectural styles associated with chain-type restaurants and service stores are strongly discouraged unless they accommodate the desired image for the Town and are compatible with adjacent structures and uses. Refer to Section 16-2-835 of this Article for illustrations. 
(h)  Location of Parking Lots. Parking requirements shall be provided to the greatest extent possible by spaces at the rear or sides of the building. Refer to Division 3 and Division 5 of this Article for additional parking requirements. 
(i)  Blank Walls. Blank, windowless walls are discouraged. Where the construction of a blank wall is necessary, the wall shall be articulated. 
(j)  Wall articulation. 
(1)  Walls shall not have an uninterrupted length exceeding fifty (50) feet. Pilasters, texture transitions, windows and stepping of the wall plane are required. 
(2)  All exterior elevations shall maintain the integrity of the adjacent dwellings architectural character and detailing. 
(3)  Continuous cornice lines or eaves are encouraged between adjacent buildings. 
(4)  Buildings with flat roofs shall provide a parapet with an articulated cornice. 
(k)  Facade Treatment. The architectural treatment of the front facade shall be continued, in its major features, around all visibly exposed sides of a building. Blank wall or service area treatment of side and/or rear elevations visible from the public viewshed is discouraged. 
(l)  Windows. Windows shall be vertically proportioned wherever possible. 
(m)  Awnings. Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted. Canvas is the preferred material, although other waterproofed fabrics may be used; metal or aluminum awnings shall not be used unless otherwise approved by the Board of Trustees. Awnings used as signage must conform to the Sign Code. 
(n)  Screening. All air-conditioning units, HVAC systems, exhaust pipes or stacks, elevator housing, satellite dishes and other telecommunications receiving devices shall be thoroughly screened from view from the public right-of-way and from adjacent properties by using walls, fencing (except chain-link), roof elements and landscaping. In addition, all trash facilities, loading and parking areas shall be properly screened. 
(o)  Architectural Details. All materials, colors and architectural details used on the exterior of a building shall be compatible with the building's style and with each other. Refer to Section 16-2-835 of this Article for illustrations of commercial architecture that the Town is encouraging. 
(Ord. 480 §2.18, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-720. - Downtown architectural standards. 
(a)  Setbacks. Buildings shall abut the front property line. Building facades may be recessed if an arcade or similar structure abuts the front setback. Architectural projections, including cornices, balconies, canopies and entry features, may encroach into public rights-of-way, subject to permits as required by the Municipal Code. 
(b)  Multi-Story, Mixed-Use Structures. Commercial uses shall be contained in multi-story (two [2] to three [3] stories) mixed-use structures with commercial/retail uses on the ground level and above and/or apartment dwellings or offices on the upper levels. Such building shall vary in terms of footprint and architectural elevations. The maximum ground level footprint of a commercial building shall be five thousand (5,000) square feet. 
(c)  Facade Treatments. Large buildings shall be articulated or designed to resemble the character and scale of the original downtown buildings, with each facade twenty-five (25) feet or less. Refer to Section 16-2-835 of this Article for examples of commercial architecture that the Town is encouraging. 
(d)  Entries. Transparent entries and large storefront windows are strongly encouraged. Recessed and other styles of window openings are desired. 
(e)  Windows. Street-level storefront windows are strongly encouraged. Office and residential windows organized in a generally regular pattern are encouraged. 
(f)  Awnings/Canopies. Awnings or canopies which provide a generally consistent cover along the pedestrian walk are strongly encouraged. Arcades are desired to maintain a more continuous weather-protected walk.

(d)  Downtown commercial standards. The following design standards shall be required for all new commercial and mixed-use land uses and developments in the Downtown: 
(1)  Access. 
a.  New commercial and mixed-use land uses and developments are not permitted to obtain vehicular access directly from Highway 60 (Broad Street) unless such access presently exists for the site and/or is approved by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT). Vehicular access to a site shall be designed from side streets and shall be located far enough from the intersection with Highway 60 so that the access does not impede traffic on Highway 60. 
b.  Adequate access for emergency service vehicles shall be provided to and throughout the site. 
(2)  Building design. 
a.  New buildings shall be designed to be compatible with existing commercial structures or rock, brick or stone construction from the early 20th century that remain in the Downtown. Compatibility may be achieved through the use of similar architectural style, materials, height, scale, mass and the use of neutral colors. Principal permitted building materials include rock, brick or native stone. Alternative materials may include lap siding or stucco. 
b.  The ground floor of new buildings facing Broad Street shall be designed to include a storefront of a minimum of fifty percent (50%) glass. Building walls that face streets other than Broad Street shall be designed with at least twenty percent (20%) of the wall area in glass. The front building line of all new buildings shall primarily be designed and constructed to align immediately behind the attached sidewalk of streets within the Downtown. Recessed doorways may be permitted to create interest on the front of the building. Outdoor seating, patios, display and landscaping areas are encouraged adjacent to sidewalks. 
c.  Restoration or renovation of existing buildings in the Downtown shall be encouraged. Where original facade materials, architectural detail, storefronts and entryways exist, they should not be covered or altered, and, where they have been removed, reconstruction using original dimensions shall be encouraged. Contemporary modifications may be appropriate where historic elements have been removed. 
d.  Additions to existing buildings shall be designed to be compatible with the existing building through the use of compatible architectural style, materials, height, scale, mass and color. 
e.  Metal buildings may be permitted, provided that a compatible treatment, utilizing the materials described in Subparagraph a. above is designed to conceal the metal building facade on Broad Street and on any sides visible from a public right-of-way. 
(3)  Building height. The maximum building height in the Downtown shall be forty (40) feet. Building height for new construction shall be of a similar height to existing adjacent buildings, but in no event shall it exceed the forty-foot height limit. 
(4)  Coverage. Coverage of the total lot area by hard-surfaced areas for commercial, industrial or mixed uses on lots may not exceed eighty-five percent (85%). The balance of the lot must be approved landscaped area. 
(5)  Fencing. 
a.  Security or privacy fencing, not exceeding six (6) feet in height, located on the rear one-third (?) of the property and not visible from Broad Street, may be permitted if the use of the enclosed area and the design of the fence meets the intent of the downtown commercial standards. Outside storage in the enclosed area is allowed as it may pertain to the use of the building. Chain-link fences shall not be allowed. Decorative fencing that is at least fifty percent (50%) open is encouraged. 
b.  Fencing in the side or front yards shall be limited to forty-two (42) inches in height and shall be at least fifty percent (50%) open. 
c.  All exterior fences which are made of wood shall be finished with a neutral stain and clear seal or left in the natural color of the wood. Painted fences shall not be permitted. 
d.  Fence support posts shall be constructed inside the fence and shall not be visible from the outside of the fence. Decorative or ornamental fence support structures maybe visible if approved by the Community Development Director. 
e.  Fencing shall be maintained in good repair and, when in substantial disrepair, shall be replaced with fencing that is in compliance with this Section. 
f.  The use of materials not customarily used for fencing shall not be permitted. 
(6)  Awnings. 
a.  Awnings shall reflect traditional prototypes in scale and placement but may be contemporary in design. 
b.  Where applicable, awning configuration shall coordinate with adjacent building awnings in height, width and profile. 
c.  Awnings shall not cover architectural elements or span across structural bays. 
d.  Simple pitched awning profiles, either retractable or fixed, are recommended. 
e.  Arched or rounded awning profiles are permitted. 
f.  Weather-treated fabric awnings are recommended. Awnings with a shiny finish (vinyl) or awnings made of metal are not allowed. 
g.  Awning color should be muted and should complement, rather than overwhelm, the overall building color scheme. 
h.  Internally illuminated or back-lit awnings are not recommended. 
(7)  Color. See Project Pride guidelines for paint standards and color palette. 
(8)  Landscaping and buffering (also see "Parking" at Paragraph (9) below). 
a.  Deciduous shade trees, selected from the Town's tree list, shall be provided at the rate of one (1) tree on approximately forty-foot centers along all existing streets in the Downtown. Where this spacing would result in a tree location in conflict with utility facilities, alleys or driveways, the spacing may be reduced or increased to facilitate the best location for tree planting purposes. Trees installed along streets shall be located within a protective tree grate that shall be flush with the sidewalk. 
b.  Additional landscaping may be provided in the form of planters or window boxes which shall be constructed of the same or similar materials used in the adjacent building or of similar materials used in benches and trash receptacles and may be designed to include bench seating. 
c.  Buffering shall be provided between land uses of different intensities, such as between residential and commercial uses. The responsibility for buffering shall rest with the proposed land use, rather than with existing land uses. Buffering may be accomplished through the use of dense plant materials, fencing, walls, berms or a combination of these methods and shall provide visual screening between the land uses, as well as screen or mitigate other negative impacts such as noise or lighting. 
d.  Minimum tree and shrub sizes shall be as follows: 
1.  Ornamental trees: one-and-one-half-inch caliper - DBH (Diameter Breast Height). 
2.  Deciduous shade trees: two-inch caliper - DBH. 
3.  Evergreen trees: six-foot height. 
4.  Shrubs: five-gallon. 
e.  Existing trees shall be preserved where feasible and when the trees are in good health and of a desirable species. When trees are removed from a site, replacement should be at a ratio of two (2) trees for every tree that was removed from the site or as approved by the Community Development Director. 
(9)  Parking. 
a.  Parking for nonresidential land uses shall generally be required in the Downtown as shown in the following chart. A waiver from the parking requirements due to the capacity of the site and nature of the use may be requested by the applicant and may be approved by the Planning Commission or Board of Trustees as applicable.

(12)  Community design principles. In addition to the requirements of this Section, the Community Design Standards in this Article shall be followed where applicable. 
(Ord. 593 §1, 2009) 
Sec. 16-2-725. - Neighborhood commercial architectural standards. 
(a)  Neighborhood Center. The design of the commercial center needs to function as a focal point or activity center for the neighborhood. The design should include, where possible, outdoor space for pedestrians, such as a plaza, outdoor cafe or seating area. 
(b)  Setbacks. Building setbacks from local and collector streets should be minimized in order to establish a visually continuous, pedestrian-oriented streetfront. In the case of large buildings for employment, storage or auto-related uses where greater setbacks are needed, a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the building shall be brought to the setback line. If a minimized setback is not maintained, the larger setback area shall have landscaping, low walls or fencing, a tree canopy and/or other site improvements along the sidewalk designed for pedestrian interest, scale and comfort. 
(c)  Driveway Crossings. Driveway crossings must place priority on the pedestrian access, and the material and layout of the pedestrian access must be continuous as it crosses the driveways, with a break in the continuity of the driveway paving and not in the pedestrian access way. Continuous driveway aisles located directly in front of a building are discouraged. Driveway cuts onto Broad Street are prohibited. 
(Ord. 480 §2.18, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-730. - Community commercial architectural standards. 
(a)  Design of developments with internal orientation. In multiple-building developments, where setbacks are increased to accommodate independent development with internal orientation, all primary building entrances must face walkways, plazas, or courtyards that have direct, continuous linkage to the street without making people walk through parking lots. However, it may be necessary for such direct pedestrian access ways to cross drive aisles. Driveway crossings must place priority on the pedestrian access. Continuous driveway aisles located directly in front of a building are discouraged.

Figure 2-29 
(c)  Requirement for Four-Sided Design. A building's special architectural features and treatments shall not be restricted to a single facade. All sides of a building open to view by the public, whether viewed from public or private property, shall display a similar level of quality and architectural interest. 
(d)  Building Form. The design of all buildings shall employ textured surfaces, projections, recesses, shadow lines, color, window patterns, overhangs, reveals, changes in parapet heights and similar architectural features to avoid monolithic shapes and surfaces and to emphasize building entries. Designs shall not contain unbroken flat walls of fifty (50) feet or greater in length. 
(1)  Buildings having single walls exceeding fifty (50) feet in length shall incorporate one (1) or more of the following for every fifty (50) feet: 
a.  Changes in color, graphical patterning, changes in texture or changes in material; 
b.  Projections, recesses and reveals; 
c.  Windows and fenestration; 
d.  Arcades and pergolas; 
e.  Towers; 
f.  Gable projections; 
g.  Horizontal/vertical breaks; and/or 
h.  Other similar techniques. 
(e)  Exterior Building Materials and Colors. Intense, bright or fluorescent colors shall not be used as the predominant color on any wall or roof of any primary or accessory structure. These colors may be used as building accent colors. 
(f)  Roof Materials. All sloping roof areas with a pitch of 3:12 or greater, and visible from any public or private right-of-way, shall be surfaced with attractive and durable materials. 
(g)  Orientation of Pedestrian Entries. All office, hotel and motel structures shall be oriented so that pedestrian entries face the nearest adjacent street. 
(Ord. 480 §2.18, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-735. - Industrial/business park architectural standards. 
    The intent of the Industrial/Business Park architectural standards is to ensure that the quality of industrial/business park development enhances the overall well-being and image of the community. 
(1)  Subsections (c) through (g) of Section 16-2-730 of this Article shall apply. 
(2)  Building Massing and Form: 
a.  Office and entry spaces shall be distinguished from the building mass. 
b.  Large, square, "box-like" structures are not an acceptable form. Architectural elements with smaller forms stepping outwards and down shall be included. 
c.  Loading areas shall not front any street or public right-of way. 
d.  Parking requirements shall be provided to the extent possible at the rear or sides of the building. 
(3)  Wall Articulation. Walls shall not have an uninterrupted length exceeding fifty (50) feet. Pilasters, texture transitions, windows and stepping of the wall plane are required. Refer to Section 16-2-835 of this Article for examples of industrial architectural styles that the Town is encouraging. 
(4)  Siting Structures. 
a.  Structures shall be sited to avoid a "wall" affect along public rights-of-way and along adjacent property lines. This can be achieved by varying the building setbacks and clustering buildings. 
b.  Where multiple buildings are proposed on a development parcel, buildings shall be oriented to allow views into the project and shall preserve high-quality views through the project (e.g., views of the mountains). 
(Ord. 480 §2.18, 2003) 
Division 8 - Development Standards 

Sec. 16-2-810. - Lighting. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this Section is as follows: 
(1)  To create an attractive lighting system to enhance visibility and safety, while minimizing glare and contrast. 
(2)  To encourage exterior lighting that is functional, aesthetically pleasing and complementary to the architectural style of buildings. 
(b)  General Provisions. 
(1)  Evaluation of Exterior Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be evaluated in the development review process to ensure that the functional and security needs of the project are met in a way that does not adversely affect the adjacent properties or neighborhood. 
(2)  Light Style. The style of lights shall be consistent with the style and character of architecture proposed on the site. Light fixtures that illuminate signage shall be compatible with the architecture of the building on which they are placed. 
(3)  Concealed Light Source. Light sources shall be concealed or shielded to the maximum extent feasible to minimize the potential for glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property and away from the vision of passing motorists. All lights shall be directed downward and the light source shall be equipped with "cut-off" devices so that it will not be visible from any adjacent property and to ensure that ambient skyward light is eliminated. Accent and flagpole lighting shall be permitted to be directed upward as long as the light source is shielded and not visible from any adjacent property. Light fixtures installed under canopies, awnings, overhangs and the like shall be fully recessed. 
(4)  Hours of Lighting Operation. All parking lot lighting fixtures and exterior building lights, except those required for security purposes, shall be extinguished within one (1) hour after the end of business hours and remain extinguished until one (1) hour prior to the beginning of business hours. If a portion of a parking lot is used after dark, only that portion shall be lighted. 
(5)  Height Standards for Lighting. 
a.  Residential Zoning Districts. Light fixtures shall be mounted on concrete, fiberglass or painted metal poles no higher than sixteen (16) feet from the ground. Lighting mounted on a building or structure shall not exceed the height of the building or structure. Bollard-type lighting fixtures shall be between three (3) and four (4) feet high. 
b.  Nonresidential Zoning Districts. Light fixtures shall be mounted on concrete, fiberglass or painted metal poles no higher than twenty-five (25) feet from the ground, unless a greater height, not to exceed the maximum building height in the applicable zone district, is approved by the Planning Commission or Board of Trustees through a development application review process. Lighting mounted on a building or structure shall not exceed the height of the building or structure. Bollard-type lighting fixtures shall be between three (3) and four (4) feet high. 
(6)  Exemption for Outdoor Recreational Uses. Because of their limited hours of operation and their unique requirements for nighttime visibility, ball diamonds, playing fields, tennis courts and other similar outdoor recreational uses (both public and private), unless otherwise restricted by the Board of Trustees, shall be exempt from the general provisions of this Section. However, exterior lighting for such uses shall be extinguished no later than 11:00 p.m. 
(Ord. 480 §2.19, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-815. - Environmental considerations. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this Section is to ensure that new development limits/mitigates its impact to wildlife and wildlife habitat and that it minimizes environmental impacts. 
(b)  General Provisions. 
(1)  Protection of Wildlife and Natural Areas. To the maximum extent practical, development shall be designed to ensure that disturbances which occur to any natural area as a result of development shall be minimized through the use of natural buffer zones. If any development materially disturbs a natural area, the development project shall mitigate such lost natural resource either on- or off-site. Any such mitigation shall be roughly proportional to the loss suffered as a result of the disturbance. 
a.  Natural areas shall include: floodplains and floodways, natural drainage and water ways, significant native trees and vegetation, wildlife travel corridors, special habitat features such as raptor nest sites, key nesting, breeding or feeding areas for birds; fox and coyote dens, prairie dog colonies over twenty-five (25) acres in size, remnant native prairie habitat, plains cottonwood galleries, and any wetland greater than one-quarter (1/4) acre in size. 
b.  The natural area buffer zone shall be used between natural areas and proposed development to ensure that the proposed development does not degrade the natural area. The size of the buffer zone shall be determined in conjunction with the Colorado Division of Wildlife or a Town-approved wetland or wildlife ecologist. The Town may decrease this buffer when strict application of this Paragraph will impose an exceptional and undue hardship upon the property owner or developer. 
c.  Exceptions. The Board of Trustees may allow disturbance or construction activity within the natural area or natural area buffer zone for the following limited purposes: mitigation of development activities, restoration of previously degraded areas, emergency public safety activities and utility installations when such activities and installations cannot reasonably be contained within other nearby develop areas, construction of a trail that will provide public access for educational or recreational purposes, or the enhancement of the habitat value and/or other natural resource values of a natural area. 
d.  Ecological Characterization. If the Town determines that the site likely includes areas with wildlife, plant life and/or other natural characteristics in need of protection, the Town may require the developer to provide a report prepared by a professional qualified in the areas of ecology, wildlife biology or other relevant discipline. The ecological characterization report should be included on the open space plan and describe the following: 
1.  The wildlife use of the natural area showing the species of the wildlife using the area, the times or seasons the area is used by those species and the "value" (meaning feeding, watering, cover, nesting, roosting, perching) that the area provides for such wildlife species; 
2.  The boundary of wetlands in the area and a description of the ecological functions and characteristics provided by those wetlands; 
3.  Any prominent views from or across the site; 
4.  The pattern, species and location of any significant native trees and other native site vegetation; 
5.  The bank, shoreline and high water mark of any perennial stream or body of water on the site; 
6.  Wildlife travel corridors; and 
7.  The general ecological functions provided by the site and its features. 
e.  Wildlife Conflicts. If wildlife that may create conflicts for the future occupants of the development (including, but not limited to, prairie dogs, beaver, deer and rattlesnakes) are known to exist in areas adjacent to or on the development site, then the development plan must, to the extent reasonably feasible, include provisions such as barriers, protection mechanisms for landscaping and other site features to minimize conflicts that might otherwise exist between such wildlife and the developed portion of the site. Any impacts to wildlife must be referred to the Colorado Division of Wildlife and, in the case of threatened or endangered species, United States Fish and Wildlife Services. 
(c)  Green Builder Guidelines. The Green Builder Program establishes environmental standards for the construction and operation of buildings. The intent of this program is to promote building practices which benefit the environment and the socio-economic well-being of current and future residents. 
(1)  There are five (5) resource areas which are addressed by the Green Builder standards: 
a.  Water (quality and quantity); 
b.  Energy (quantity and type); 
c.  Building materials (life cycle impacts); 
d.  Solid waste (construction and operation impacts); and 
e.  Health and safety. 
(2)  Compliance. Compliance with the requirements of the Colorado Green Builder Program b is strongly encouraged. 
(Ord. 480 §2.20, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-820. - Sanitary sewer. 
    All residential, commercial and industrial uses which have human occupancy shall have sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer system shall be connected to an existing public sanitary sewer system and shall consist of a closed system of sanitary sewer mains and lateral branch connections to each structure or lot upon which a structure is to be built. Sanitary sewer lines are to be of sufficient size and design to collect all sewage from all proposed or portable structures within the subdivision or development. On a case-by-case basis, the Board of Trustees may approve individual sewage disposal systems that comply with County Health Department standards. However no new addition, upgrade or major repair to an individual sewage disposal system will be permitted if the property is located within four hundred (400) feet of a municipal or sanitation district collection line, measured through existing sewer easements or utility rights-of-way, except where such connection is not feasible or has been denied by the Town or district. 
(Ord. 480 §2.21, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-825. - Potable water. 
    All residential, commercial and industrial uses which have human occupancy shall have potable water served by the Town or appropriate water district. The water system shall be of sufficient size and design to supply potable water to each structure or lot upon which a structure is to be built. 
(Ord. 480 §2.22, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-830. - Fire hydrants. 
    The subdivider shall install fire hydrants at street intersections and at other points as per the requirements of the District. Fire hydrants shall have national standards threads, two-and-one-half-inch outlets and four-and-one-half-inch or six-inch streamers. 
(Ord. 480 §2.23, 2003) 
Sec. 16-2-835. - Design vocabulary.

(7)  No building shall hereafter be changed to a residential, business, commercial or industrial use, nor shall any new structure, building or land be occupied for a residential, business, commercial or industrial use unless the owner has first obtained a certificate of occupancy from the Building Official. Provided that the use is in conformance with the provisions of this Article, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued within a reasonable time after written notification that the building is ready for occupancy. 
(8)  The fact that land is zoned pursuant to this Article does not excuse compliance with Town subdivision regulations and community design and development standards. 
(c)  Conflict with Other Provisions of Law. Whenever the requirements of this Article are at a variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, the more restrictive or that imposing the higher standards shall govern. 
(d)  Conflict with Private Covenants or Deeds. In case of a conflict between this Code and any private restrictions imposed by covenant or deed, the responsibility of the Town of Milliken shall be limited to the enforcement of this Code. When provisions within this Code are more restrictive than those imposed by covenant or deed, or when any such private instruments are silent on matters contained within this Code, the provisions of this Code shall rule.

The Town Clerk is referred to as the "administrative official" in this Article. The function of administering this Article shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, reviewing proposed construction projects and other proposed land use activities to determine compliance with this Article; interpreting words, phrases and concepts contained herein; obtaining factual material needed for making decisions which this Article requires to be made; and performing other duties specifically or impliedly delegated to the administration official by other sections of this Article.

Sec. 16-3-110. - Zoning districts. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this Code, the Town is divided into the following zoning districts: 
DR Developing Resource A Agricultural AE Agricultural Estates CD Conservation E-1 Estate Zoning - Rural Subdivision R-1 Single-Family Residential R-1E Single-Family Estate Residential R-2 Two-Family Residential R-3 Multi-Family Residential R-FH Factory Built Housing District R-M Mobile Home Community C-1 Office C-2 Local Business C-3 General Business C-4 Service Business C-5 Special Business District MU-C-D Mixed Use Commercial - Downtown I-1 Light Industrial I-2 Medium Industrial I-3 Heavy Industrial PUD Planned Unit Development HSP Hillside/Ridgeline Protection Overlay  
(Ord. 480 §3.3, 2003; Ord. 752 , § 2, 10-21-2017) 
Sec. 16-3-120. - Zoning district map. 
    The boundaries and classifications of districts established are as depicted on a map entitled Town Zoning District Map, as may from time to time be revised, updated or redrafted. The official zoning district map adopted and to be used for present reference shall be that map bearing the most recent date of publication that has been signed by the Town Clerk and the Mayor. 
(1)  Interpretation of Boundary Lines. 
a.  Zoning District Boundaries - In the event uncertainty is deemed to exist on the zoning district map, district boundaries shall be on section lines, lot lines, the center lines of highways, streets, alleys, railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended; municipal corporation lines; natural boundary lines, such as streams; or other lines to be determined by the use of scales shown on the map. Where a lot is divided by a zoning district boundary line at the time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this section or by subsequent amendments to that ordinance or this Article, either zone requirements may be extended within the lot for a distance of not more than twenty-five (25) feet. If, after application of the foregoing rules, uncertainty still exists as to the exact location of a zoning district boundary line, the line shall be determined by the Town Clerk in a reasonable manner, considering the history of the Town's zoning ordinances and amendments, and other factors he or she deems relevant; his or her decision shall be subject to review by the Board of Trustees. 
b.  Floodplain District Boundaries - Floodplain district boundaries, as depicted by separate maps, are estimates based upon data verified from the Colorado Water Conservation Board, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Board of Trustees on flood-prone areas. 
(2)  Amendment Upon Zoning or Modification. Upon enactment of any ordinance annexing and establishing zoning or modifying existing zoning for any property, and upon final passage thereof, the Town shall amend the prior existing official map to include the annexed area with the proper zoning classification or show the amended classification, as the case may be. Such updated, current official map shall contain, in table form, the date and number of the ordinance amending it, the date the map was amended to reflect each amendment and the initials of the person who checked and approved the change to the map. 
(3)  Cost for Amending Zoning. Any person who proposes zoning for property being annexed or proposes modifying existing zoning shall bear the entire cost of amending the official zoning map, including all notification costs. The Town shall provide applicants with a copy of the current fee schedule and fee agreement form. 
(4)  Public Inspection; Storage of Original. The official zoning district map shall be available and on display at the Town Hall during normal business hours. In addition, one (1) original duplicate Mylar copy of the current official map, and all prior official maps having been adopted, shall be held under lock and in a secure place by the Town Clerk, who shall act as custodian thereof, and the map shall not be amended, changed, updated or otherwise modified or let out of direct control of the Town Clerk for any reason whatsoever. The secured map is to be released for inspection only upon authorization of the Town Clerk. 
(Ord. 480 §3.3, 2003) 
Division 3 - Uses by Right and Special Review Uses 

Sec. 16-3-210. - General application of uses. 
(a)  Uses designated as uses by right are allowed in a zone district as a matter of right. Uses classified as uses by special review are permitted upon the Board of Trustees' approval of a special use permit, pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in Section 16-3-500 of this Article. Unless a use is designated as a use by right or use by special review or is classified as a legal nonconforming building, structure or use, it is not permitted. 
(b)  If this Article does not identify a land use as a use by right or an accessory use in a particular zoning district, or if the use is not identified as a use by special review, the use is prohibited in that district. If a particular land use is not permitted in a zoning district, a building that is designed for that land use also is prohibited. For example, if the sale of merchandise at retail is prohibited in a particular zoning district that does permit residential uses, a store building would be prohibited in that district, even though used as a residence. Similarly, if a land use is described by reference to a type of building, the only land uses intended to be covered by the description are those for which the building is designed. 
(c)  If a land use could be classified under two (2) or more land use descriptions, the land use shall be classified according to that description which most specifically describes it. 
(d)  The administrative official shall make the initial determination as to the land use descriptions contained in this Article that best identify an actual land use or proposed land use. 
(e)  Unspecified Uses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, land uses not otherwise identified in this Code may be proposed for development. In order to provide for such uses, the classification of any new or unlisted land use shall be made by the Board of Trustees to determine if the use can be reasonably interpreted to fit into a similar use category described in this Code. The Board will determine if such unspecified use shall be considered a use by right, accessory use or use by special review within any particular zone district. Unless such determination is made, the use is not permitted. An applicant shall make a request for such determination in writing and submit it to the Town Clerk. The Board of Trustees shall consider the request at a regularly scheduled meeting. 
(Ord. 480 §3.4, 2003) 
Sec. 16-3-220. - Special classification of mineral lands and floodplain areas. 
    With one (1) exception, the zoning district classifications provided for in this Article refer to the uses of land, rather than to the characteristics of land itself. The one (1) exception is the Conservation District (CD), which is included in order to provide a means for classifying land by reference to its inherent characteristics. Therefore, all land in the Town that is subject to classification under the Conservation District (CD) shall be assigned only to that district, regardless of the use that an owner desires to make of such land. 
(Ord. 480 §3.4, 2003) 
Sec. 16-3-225. - Accessory buildings. 
    Accessory building or accessory structure means a subordinate building or structure, the use of which is customarily incidental to that of the main building/structure or to the main use of the land, which is located on the same lot (or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership) with the main building, structure or use. Accessory buildings or accessory structures are only permitted when they are incidental or accessory to an existing and permitted principal or conditional use. 
    Accessory buildings and structures which are not any larger than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area, as measured around the perimeter of the building shall be permitted without a building permit. 
    Accessory buildings and structures, except fences, in the residential districts, shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  General Statements. An accessory building or structure shall not be attached to or have a common wall with the principal building. Covered (but otherwise unenclosed) walkways shall not be considered attachments for the purposes of this subsection except that a garage connected to the principal building with a covered walkway shall be considered a detached accessory building subject to the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Time of Construction. No accessory building or structure shall be constructed on any lot prior to the time of construction of the principal building to which it is accessory, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. 
(3)  Location. No detached accessory building or structure other than a private garage shall be located within a front or corner side yard. 
(4)  Height. No accessory building or structure in a residential district shall be taller than the principal building on the lot, with the exception of the AE Agricultural Estate District, in which the height may exceed the height of the principal building, but it may not be greater than twenty-one (21) feet tall. The building height shall be measured from the lowest point of the base of the building to the highest structural point of the building and shall not include nonstructural additions to the building which themselves are not more than five (5) feet in height, such as antennas, lightning rods or weather vanes. 
(5)  Setbacks and Location. 
a.  Accessory building setbacks are as follows: 
District Side, Interior Side, Corner Rear Rear With Alley A Agricultural 15 ft. 15 ft. 20 ft. 10 ft. AE Agricultural Estate 15 ft. 15 ft. 20 ft. 10 ft. E-1 Estate 15 ft. 15 ft. 20 ft. 10 ft. R-1 Single-Family Residential 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. R-1E Single-Family Estate Residential 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. R-2 Two-Family Residential 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. R-3 Multi-Family Residential 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft. MU-C-D, when accessory to a residential use 5 ft. 15 ft. 5 ft. 5 ft.

(7)  Building Design Standards. The architectural design and appearance of all accessory buildings and structures shall comply with the following standards. Each of the following standards shall be met in order for the Planning Commission to approve a use by special review related to accessory buildings: 
a.  All accessory buildings and structures of any size shall be constructed of durable, finished materials and shall be compatible in color to the principal building. All accessory buildings and structures greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area shall match as closely as possible the exterior finish, architectural style, roof style and roof pitch of the principal building on the lot. Brick, stucco and stone dwellings justify an exemption for required matched building exteriors. Alternate materials shall only be allowed in such cases by approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
b.  All accessory buildings and structures are to be securely anchored to prevent uplifting due to wind. 
c.  All storage buildings shall be sided or otherwise finished. 
d.  Temporary accessory buildings and structures such as portable carports, shelters, tarped covers and similar structures as determined by the Community Development Department, shall be prohibited. 
(8)  Exemptions for Agricultural Buildings and Structures. Agricultural buildings and structures, when part of an agricultural use or limited agricultural use as defined in this Chapter, shall only be subject to the lot coverage and setback requirements set forth in Paragraph (a)(5) of this Section. 
(9)  Use by Special Review. The Planning Commission may authorize additional accessory buildings or structures, a greater lot coverage and/or a greater height as a use by special review in accordance with Section 16-3-500 of this Chapter. The following standards shall be considered: 
a.  The area and/or height of the accessory buildings or structures is aesthetically appropriate in relation to the size of the lot and the corresponding uses in the neighborhood on which it is to be placed; 
b.  The area and/or height of the accessory building or structures is appropriate in relation to the principal building on the lot on which it is to be placed; 
c.  The location of the accessory building or structure is appropriate in relation to other buildings on the lot or adjoining lots and in relation to the principal building; 
d.  Whether or not the accessory building or structure will affect light and air circulation of the adjoining property; 
e.  The building or structure has been appropriately screened through fencing, berming and/or landscaping from adjacent properties and the public view; and 
f.  Impacts to adjacent land uses have been satisfactorily mitigated.

Such incidental uses in residential districts include, by way of example, the cultivation of flowers, plants and vegetables for private consumption and the maintenance and use of private swimming pools, hot tubs and tennis courts. Under no circumstance shall a commercial use be deemed an incidental use in a residential neighborhood. In addition to the general types of accessory uses authorized above, the following specific accessory uses are authorized in any of the residential zoning districts (AE, E-1, R-1, R-1E, R-2, R-3, R-M, R-MH):

(a)  Intent. 
(1)  The intent and purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to permit and encourage innovative design and high quality, master-planned developments. This district is created to allow and encourage compatible uses to be developed in accordance with a unified development plan in harmony with the environment and surrounding neighborhood. The PUD District is intended to permit greater flexibility in the application of zoning and development standards and greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the development of a balanced community. PUDs are expected to preserve critical environmental resources, provide above-average open space and recreational amenities, include exceptional design and provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities and other infrastructure. 
(2)  This Article is intended to supersede the provisions of, and prevent the application in this Town of, the Planned Unit Development Act of 1972 (Title 24, Article 67, C.R.S.), except that this Article shall not be deemed to supersede the Planned Unit Development Act of 1972, appearing as Article 67 of Title 24, C.R.S., with respect to the provisions of that act pertaining to the continued maintenance and upkeep of open space and other commonly owned areas and the consequences of failing to maintain such areas. 
(b)  Permitted Uses. 
(1)  Any combination of uses may be permitted in a PUD District so long as the Board of Trustees determines that such uses are compatible with one another and with any property that could reasonably be impacted by the development of any proposed PUD. Compatibility shall be determined based on the extent to which any proposed use of land within the PUD would unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of any other use of land within the PUD. Factors which may be considered include the type and intensity of uses, the extent to which uses complement one another, the bulk of structures associated with use, and the noise, light, traffic, vibrations and other similar external impacts associated with each use. 
(2)  The density and/or intensity of development shall be based on the capacity of the land proposed for development to support the PUD as well as the impact of the proposed development on Town services and facilities and on neighboring property that reasonably could be impacted by the proposed development. Capacity of the land shall be determined based on the size, topography and geological and environmental limitations of the land proposed for development. Notwithstanding the foregoing, residential development shall not exceed a gross density of twelve (12) units per acre; commercial development shall not exceed a floor area ratio of 0.5; office development shall not exceed a floor area ratio of 4.0; industrial development shall not exceed a floor area ratio of 1.0. In a mixed-use PUD, the gross density shall be calculated based on the gross land area devoted to each type of use. 
(c)  PUD Restrictions and General Requirements. Properties utilizing the PUD District shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  All PUD applications shall include a gross land area of not less than two (2) acres, except in the R-M and R-MH Districts, where the gross land area shall not be less than six (6) acres. Upon the specific request of the landowner or upon the recommendation of the Board of Trustees, the two-acre requirement set forth in this Section may be waived if, after considering the land use requested, the Board of Trustees finds that such waiver would be beneficial to the Town and foster the objectives of this Code. 
(2)  The area of land for the PUD may be controlled by one (1) or more landowners and must be developed under unified control or a unified plan of development. 
(3)  Areas designated as private streets and/or common open space including land, an area of water or a combination of land and water within the site designated for a PUD shall be designed and intended primarily for the use or enjoyment of residents, occupants and owners of the PUD; and provisions shall be made for the establishment of an organization for the ownership and maintenance of such private streets and/or common open space areas unless other adequate arrangements for the ownership and maintenance thereof are provided in a manner acceptable to the Town. 
(4)  All requirements set forth in this Code otherwise applicable to the area of land proposed for a PUD shall govern, except to the extent that the unified plan of development for residential, commercial, educational, recreational or industrial uses or any combination thereof may propose exceptions in lot size, bulk, type of use, density, lot coverage, open space or other standards within the existing land use regulations, except those development standards that are not open to modification (see Section 16-4-530 of this Code). 
(5)  No PUD may be approved by the Town without the written consent of the landowner whose property is included within the PUD. 
(d)  PUD Approval Procedure. 
(1)  All PUD District applications shall be submitted and processed simultaneously with the processing of subdivision applications for the property. The processes set forth in Sections 16-4-160 through 16-4-190 of this Code for major subdivisions shall be followed, including all preapplication conferences, Planning Commission visioning meetings, sketch plan, preliminary plat and final plat applications, and all required public hearings. Scheduling requirements for PUD applications shall match those specified for sketch plans and preliminary and final plats.

a.  The proposed benefits offset the proposed exceptions to the zoning and subdivision standards, and that such exceptions are in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. 
b.  The proposed PUD conforms to the PUD restrictions, and the proposed zoning is compatible with the surrounding land uses. 
c.  The PUD proposes creative and innovative design and high quality development, thereby protecting and promoting public safety, convenience, health and general welfare. 
d.  The uses and densities in the proposed PUD are compatible, and will be effectively integrated with adjacent neighborhoods that now exist or are proposed in the future. 
e.  The proposed PUD is in general conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, Community Design and Development Standards and the Johnstown/Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan and the criteria as set forth in Section 16-2-20 of this Code. 
f.  One (1) or more of the criteria for amendment of the official zoning map has been satisfied. 
(2)  Preliminary PUD Development Plan Review Criteria. In addition to all of the review criteria for a sketch PUD development plan, the following review criteria will be used by the Town Staff and Board of Trustees to evaluate all PUD applications at the time of preliminary PUD plan/preliminary plat: 
a.  The preliminary PUD development plan is substantially consistent with the sketch development plan as approved by the Board of Trustees. 
b.  All sketch PUD development plan conditions of approval have been adequately addressed on the preliminary PUD development plan. 
(3)  Final PUD Development Plan Review Criteria. In addition to all of the review criteria for a preliminary PUD development plan, the following review criteria will be used by the Town Staff and Board of Trustees to evaluate all PUD applications at the time of final PUD plan/final plat: 
a.  The final PUD development plan is substantially consistent with the preliminary PUD development plan as approved by the Board of Trustees. 
b.  All preliminary PUD development plan conditions of approval have been adequately addressed on the final PUD development plan. 
(i)  Compliance with PUD District/Final Development Plan. The Board of Trustees may initiate the process to repeal the ordinance establishing the PUD District if: 
(1)  The project for which the PUD zone was established is not carried out pursuant to the approved final PUD development plan; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may approve appropriate modifications to the final PUD development plan from time to time prior to completion of the proposed development; or 
(2)  Building activity for the PUD District has not commenced within a period of one (1) year after the effective date of the creating ordinance, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Trustees. 
(j)  Land Previously Zoned PUD. Any land previously zoned PUD, and partially developed prior to the date of adoption of this Code, may continue and complete such development under the terms and conditions of approval for that PUD; subject, however, to the provision that any major modifications, as determined by the Town, to that PUD shall require review and approval under the new requirements of this Code. 
(Ord. 480 §3.4, 2003) 
Sec. 16-3-470. - HSP Hillside/Ridgeline Protection Overlay District. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. The intent and purpose of this overlay zone is to allow for low-intensity, residential development that addresses concerns for public health and safety and promotes the design criteria set forth below. All new development in this zone shall be sensitive to the hillside terrain and to the environmental constraints and shall provide for the conservation of existing natural open space lands, unique landforms, scenic hillsides and sensitive biological habitats. These environmental constraints include potential danger from fire, slope failure and erosion, as well as the difficulty of emergency evacuation. Protection of the physical environment, public views and aesthetic qualities associated with undeveloped lands is of critical concern in this zone. Low-intensity agricultural uses and passive, recreational uses are also appropriate for this zone. 
(b)  Design criteria. 
(1)  The area included in the hillside/ ridgeline protection zone encompasses a substantial amount of the Town's undeveloped hillsides and ridgelines that overlook the Thompson River valley. Not only does this land incorporate some of the most undisturbed physical environments in the Town, but it also supports many environmentally sensitive habitats. These include ridgelines and unique landforms such as rock outcroppings and bluffs. In addition, land within this zone contains physical conditions such as steep topography and geologically sensitive areas that increase the environmental concerns of this zoning district. 
(2)  The following design criteria have been established to help ensure that future development proposals take the proper steps to avoid adverse impacts on these unique resources. In addition, all development proposals shall be subject to the zoning standards and design review procedures of this Code and shall be strictly evaluated for conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Johnstown/ Milliken Parks, Trails, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. The Town may also require detailed environmental studies to identify specific impacts and the necessary mitigation measures. All development proposals shall be subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Building Site. Buildings and other improvements should be located on slopes of less than thirty percent (30%), should be situated such that they do not adversely impact any mapped environmentally sensitive areas and should minimize impacts to ridgelines, geologic hazard areas, unique landforms and areas of high biological value. 
b.  Mass and Scale. The height and scale of the buildings should respect the natural surroundings and unique visual resources by incorporating designs that minimize bulk and mass, follow natural topography and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscape. Structures shall be limited to one-story buildings. 
c.  Building Size. In addition to the mass and scale of the residence, the total square footage shall also be maintained at a size compatible with the open space characteristics of the hillsides. Residential designs should blend in with the surroundings, while minimizing their prominence to public view. As such, larger lots shall not necessarily enable the development of correspondingly larger homes. 
d.  Architectural Style. The architectural style, including materials and colors, should be compatible with the natural setting by encouraging designs that blend in with the surroundings. Natural materials, such as stone, and natural colors are required. 
e.  Grading. Development proposals should minimize grading of hillside areas by encouraging designs that follow the natural grade while maintaining a building mass and scale that is sensitive to topography. 
f.  Landscaping. The proposal should maintain native vegetation to the greatest extent possible and should include the provision of additional native vegetation to mitigate potential visual impacts and erosion concerns associated with the development proposal. 
g.  Ridgelines. No development shall be permitted which, in any way, alters an existing ridgeline, including topographic changes, visual obstruction or other direct impacts on the natural profile of the ridgeline. If, during the initial development review, it is determined that a project could impact other ridgelines not identified in the general plan, the appropriate mitigation measures shall be required to protect the physical and aesthetic character of the ridgeline. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, a restriction on ridgeline development and specific design modifications as may be required. It is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate with a view analysis that the development will not adversely impact the ridgeline and will fit into the site's context and surroundings. 
h.  Setbacks for Ridgeline Development. Notwithstanding the dimensional standards for individual zoning districts, all structures shall be set back a minimum distance of two hundred (200) feet from the edge of a ridgeline. 
(c)  Uses permitted. Buildings, structures and land shall be used, and buildings and structures shall hereafter be erected, designed, structurally altered or enlarged, within the HSP Overlay District as allowed in the underlying zone district, subject to compliance with the design criteria and standards contained in this Section.

1 That portion of a lot that abuts a public street right-of-way, excluding public alleys, shall remain uncovered for a distance of 10 feet, measured at a right angle from the lot line towards the interior of the lot. This shall apply to lots in all zoning districts, except the MU-C-D District. Sidewalks and driveways may pass through the ten-foot strip. 
2 The required side or rear yards in industrial zoning districts shall be increased if the lot is adjacent to 1 or more residential or commercial zoning districts. In such cases the required yard shall be twice the height of the building on the lot in the industrial zoning district, or 50 feet, whichever is greater. The only structures permitted in these side or rear yard areas are driveways, sidewalks, signs, retaining walls and fences. Accessory buildings are not permitted in these special side or year yards. 
3 The required side or rear yards in commercial zoning districts shall be increased if the lot is adjacent to 1 or more residential zoning districts. In such cases the required yard shall be twice the height of the building on the lot in the commercial zoning district, or 25 feet, whichever is greater. The only structures permitted in these side or rear yard areas are driveways, sidewalks, signs, retaining walls and fences. Accessory buildings are not permitted in these special side or rear yards.

6 For the downtown area, building height shall be of a similar height to existing adjacent buildings, but in no event shall it exceed the forty-foot height limit. 
7 Coverage for commercial uses on commercial lots in the downtown area may exceed 85%. 
(3)  Yard Requirements. 
a.  On double-frontage lots (see Figure 2-5 of this Chapter), both streets shall be considered street frontages for purposes of calculating front yard setbacks. 
b.  On corner lots, all sides of the lot with street frontage shall meet the applicable front yard setback. 
c.  For purposes of setback calculations, a two-family dwelling shall be construed as one (1) building occupying one (1) lot. 
d.  On a vacant lot bordered on two (2) sides by previously constructed legal nonconforming buildings which do not meet the required front yard setback for the zoning district, the required front yard setback for the vacant lot shall be calculated as the average front yard setback of the two (2) adjacent buildings. Where a vacant lot is bordered on only one (1) side by such a legal nonconforming building, the required front yard setback shall be calculated as the average of the front yard setback of the adjacent building and the minimum front yard setback for the zoning district. 
e.  That portion of a side yard that is overlapped by a front or rear yard shall be deemed a side yard for purposes of limitations applicable to side yards; and that portion of a front or rear yard overlapped by a side yard shall be deemed a front or rear yard, as the case may be, for purposes of limitations applicable to front or rear yards. 
f.  Permanent features and structures allowed within required yards shall include: 
1.  Cornices, canopies, eaves, chimneys or other similar architectural features if they extend no more than three (3) feet into a required setback and if they do not encroach into or overhang an easement; 
2.  Steps or ramps to the principal entrance and necessary landings, provided that they do not extend more than six (6) feet into the required setback; 
3.  Landscaping; 
4.  Driveways, sidewalks, signs, retaining walls and fences are allowed in required front, side and rear yards, provided that all other regulations of this Chapter pertaining to these items are complied with; 
5.  Utility service lines to a structure and utility lines, wires and associated structures within a utility easement; 
6.  Fire escapes, provided that they do not extend more than six (6) feet into the required setback; 
7.  Parking slabs, tennis courts and swimming pools may be extended into required rear yards and interior side yards up to five (5) feet of the required rear or side lot lines; and

Division 4 - Supplemental Uses 

Sec. 16-3-610. - Wireless communications facilities. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the Town Board finds that these regulations are necessary to: 
(1)  Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance, modification, and removal of wireless communications infrastructure in the Town with the fewest number of Wireless Communications Facilities (WCFs) to complete a network without unreasonably discriminating against wireless communications providers of functionally equivalent services, including all of those who install, maintain, operate, and remove WCFs; 
(2)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the visibility of WCFs to the fullest extent possible through techniques including but not limited to Camouflage Design Techniques and undergrounding of WCFs and the equipment associated therewith; 
(3)  Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive WCFs to supplement existing larger WCFs; 
(4)  Encourage the use of wall-mounted panel antennas; 
(5)  Encourage roof-mounted antennas only when wall-mounted antennas will not provide adequate service or are not otherwise feasible; 
(6)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas, in a manner that minimizes the total number of towers needed throughout the community; 
(7)  Encourage strongly the collocation of WCFs on new and existing sites; 
(8)  Encourage owners and users of antennas and towers to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimized; 
(9)  Enhance the ability of wireless communications service providers to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; and 
(10)  Effectively manage WCFs in the public right-of-way. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The requirements set forth in this Section 16-3-610 shall apply to all WCF applications for base stations, alternative tower structures, alternative tower structures located within right-of-way, and towers as defined in section 16-1-150 and modifications to such facilities. 
(2)  The requirements set forth in this Section 16-3-610 shall not apply to: 
a.  Amateur Radio Antennas. Amateur radio antennas that are owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or are used exclusively for receive-only antennas, provided that the requirement that the height be no more than the distance from the base of the antenna to the property line is met. 
b.  Pre-existing WCFs. Any WCF for which a permit has been properly issued prior to September 1, 2017, shall not be required to meet the requirements of this Chapter 16, other than the requirements of Section 16-3-610(d). Changes and additions to pre-existing WCFs (including trading out of antennas for an equal number of antennas) shall meet applicable requirements of this section 16-3-610. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications qualifying as an eligible facilities requests shall be evaluated under Sections 16-3-610(e)(2) and (e)(5). 
c.  Miscellaneous Antennas. Antennas used for reception of television, multi-channel video programming and radio such as otard antennas, television broadcast band antennas, and broadcast radio antennas, provided that any requirements related to accessory uses contained in chapter 16 of this code and the requirement that the height be no more than the distance from the base to the property line are met. The Town Administrator has the authority to approve modifications to the height restriction related to otard antennas and otard antenna structures, if in the reasonable discretion of the Town, modifications are necessary to comply with federal law. 
(c)  Operational Standards. 
(1)  Federal Requirements. All WCFs shall meet the current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCF governed by this section shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to meet such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense. 
(2)  Radio Frequency Standards. All WCFs shall comply with federal standards for radio frequency emissions. If concerns regarding compliance with radio frequency emissions standards for a WCF have been made to the Town, the Town may request that the owner or operator of the WCF to provide information demonstrating compliance. If such information suggests, in the reasonable discretion of the Town, that the WCF may not be in compliance, the Town may request and the owner or operator of the WCF shall submit a project implementation report which provides cumulative field measurements of radio frequency emissions of all antennas installed at the subject site, and which compares the results with established federal standards. If, upon review, the Town finds that the facility does not meet federal standards, the Town may require corrective action within a reasonable period of time, and if not corrected, may require removal of the WCF in accordance with section 16-3-610(c)(6). Any reasonable costs incurred by the Town, including reasonable consulting costs to verify compliance with these requirements, shall be paid by the applicant. 
(3)  Signal Interference. All WCFs shall be designed and sited, consistent with applicable federal regulations, so as not to cause interference with the normal operation of radio, television, telephone and other communication services utilized by adjacent residential and non-residential properties; nor shall any such facilities interfere with any public safety communications. The applicant shall provide a written statement from a qualified radio frequency engineer, certifying that a technical evaluation of existing and proposed facilities indicates no potential interference problems and shall allow the Town to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during this process ("Signal Interference Letter"). Additionally, the applicant shall notify the Town at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, and shall allow the Town to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during the applicant's testing process. 
(4)  Legal Access. In all applications for WCFs outside of the right-of-way, an applicant shall demonstrate that it owns or has lease rights to the site. 
(5)  Operation and Maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of WCFs, the owner of a WCF shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable Town building and safety codes. If upon inspection, the Town concludes that a WCF fails to comply with such codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being provided to the owner of the WCF, the owner shall have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to bring such WCF into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the Town's chief building official may extend such compliance period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of said notice. If the owner fails to bring such WCF into compliance within said time period, the Town may remove such WCF at the owner's expense. 
(6)  Abandonment and Removal. If a WCF has not been in use for a period of three (3) months, the owner of the WCF shall notify the Town of the non-use and shall indicate whether re-use is expected within the ensuing three (3) months. Any WCF that is not operated for a continuous period of six (6) months shall be considered abandoned. The Town, in its sole discretion, may require an abandoned WCF to be removed. The owner of such WCF shall remove the same within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice form the Town. If such WCF is not removed within said thirty (30) days, the Town may remove it at the owner's expense and any approved permits for the WCF shall be deemed to have expired.

(4)  Siting. 
a.  No portion of any WCF may extend beyond the property line. 
b.  Collocation. WCFs shall be required to be designed and constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two (2) wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the Town Administrator approves an alternative design. No WCF owner or operator shall unfairly exclude a competitor from using the same facility or location. 
c.  WCFs shall be sited in a location that does not reduce the parking for the other principal uses on the parcel below code standards. 
(5)  Lighting. WCFs shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable governmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on a light pole or other similar structure primarily used for lighting purposes. If lighting is required, the Town may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible to minimize the amount of glare and light falling onto nearby properties, particularly residences. 
(6)  Landscaping and Fencing Requirements. 
a.  WCFs shall be sited in a manner that does not reduce the landscaped areas for the other principal uses on the parcel, below code standards. 
b.  WCFs shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the WCF from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of the front, side, and rear landscaped setback on the perimeter of the site.

2.  Inventory of Exiting Sites (Section 16-3-610(e)(1)(b)); and 
3.  Any other information deemed necessary by the Town Administrator to determine compliance with this section. 
b.  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a WCF shall provide to the Town Administrator a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then currently proposed WCFs within the Town, and outside of the Town within one (1) mile of its boundaries. In addition, the applicant shall inform the Town generally of the areas of the Town in which it believes WCFs may need to be located within the next three (3) years. The inventory list should identify the site name, site address, and a general description of the facility (i.e., rooftop antennas and ground mounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the applicant submit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments regarding locations of WCFs within the Town. Rather, it is a mechanism for the Town and all applicants for WCFs to share general information, assist in the Town's comprehensive planning process, and promote collocation by identifying areas in which WCFs might be appropriately constructed for multiple users. 
The Town Administrator may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or use by special review permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate WCFs within the Town, provided however, the Town Administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
c.  In all zoning districts and planned developments, applications for base stations, alternative tower structures and alternative tower structures within right-of-way, shall be reviewed by the Town Administrator for conformance to this section and the site plan review procedures set forth in Section 16-4-430 of this Code. 
d.  In all zoning districts and planned developments, all Towers may be permitted only as a use by special review. WCFs shall be reviewed for conformance to this section and code using the use by special review procedures set forth in section 16-3-500 of this Chapter. All applications for towers shall demonstrate that other alternative design options such as base stations or alternative tower structures are not viable options as determined by the Town. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, no tower located in the right-of-way shall exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height. 
(2)  Administrative review procedures for eligible facilities requests. 
a.  Application. In all zoning districts and planned developments, eligible facilities requests for collocation on or modification of an existing tower or base station shall be considered a use by right subject to administrative review. The Town shall prepare and, from time to time, revise and make publicly available, an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the Town to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. Such information may include, without limitation, whether the project: 
1.  Would result in a substantial change; and 
2.  Violates a generally applicable law, regulation, or other rule codifying objective standards reasonably related to public health and safety. 
The applicant shall not be required to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification or collocation. 
b.  Type of review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this section, the Town Administrator shall review such application to determine whether the application so qualifies. 
c.  Timeframe for review. Subject to the tolling provisions of subparagraph d. below, within sixty (60) days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this section, the Town shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this subsection. 
d.  Tolling of the timeframe for review. The sixty-day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of the Town and the applicant, or in cases where the Town Administrator determines that the application is incomplete: 
1.  To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the Town must provide written notice to the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application; 
2.  The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental written submission in response to the Town's notice of incompleteness; and 
3.  Following a supplemental submission, the Town will notify the applicant within ten (10) days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in subsection d.1. In the case of a second or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the Town may not specify missing information or documents that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 
e.  Failure to act. In the event the Town fails to act on a request seeking approval for an eligible facilities request under this section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when the applicant notifies the Town in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. 
f.  Interaction with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. If the Town determines that the applicant's request is not an eligible facilities request as delineated in this Section, the presumptively reasonable timeframe under section 332(c)(7) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as prescribed by the FCC's shot clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the Town's decision that the application is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the Town may request additional information from the applicant to evaluate the application under section 332(c)(7) review. 
(3)  Abandonment and removal. Prior to approval, affidavits shall be required from the owner of the property and from the applicant acknowledging that each is responsible for the removal of a WCF that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six (6) months. 
(4)  Decision. Any decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a WCF, shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. The applicant shall receive a copy of the decision. 
(5)  Compliance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the approval of an application for new WCFs or collocation as described herein, all work done pursuant to WCF applications must be completed in accordance with all applicable building structural, electrical and safety requirements as set forth in Town code and any other applicable laws or regulations. In addition, all WCF applications shall comply with the following: 
a.  Comply with any permit or license issued by a local, state, or federal agency with jurisdiction of the WCF; 
b.  Comply with easements, covenants, conditions and/or restrictions on or applicable to the underlying real property; 
c.  Be maintained in good working condition and to the standards established at the time of application approval; and 
d.  Remain free from trash, debris, litter, graffiti, and other forms of vandalism. Any damage shall be repaired as soon as practicable, and in no instance more than ten (10) calendar days from the time of notification by the Town or after discovery by the owner or operator of the site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any graffiti on WCFs located in the rights-of-way or on other Town-owned property may be removed by the Town at its discretion, and the owner and/or operator of the WCF shall pay all costs of such removal within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from the Town. 
(6)  Compliance report. Upon request by the Town, the applicant shall provide a compliance report within forty-five (45) days after installation of a WCF, demonstrating that as installed and in operation, the WCF complies with all conditions of approval, applicable code requirements and standard regulations. 
(f)  Standards for approval. 
(1)  Eligible Facilities Requests. It is the intent of the Town to approve WCFs administratively in cases where visual impacts are minimized, view corridors are protected, WCFs utilize appropriate camouflage/concealment design techniques to avoid adverse impacts on the surrounding area, and WCFs are designed, maintained, and operated at all times to comply with the provisions of this title and all applicable law. Notwithstanding the approval of an application for collocation as described herein, all work done pursuant to WCF applications must be completed in accordance with all applicable building and safety requirements as set forth in Town code and any other applicable regulations. 
(2)  Except eligible facilities requests, no WCF, including related accessory equipment, shall be approved unless it meets the following approval criteria: 
a.  Visual impacts are minimized and view corridors and protected to the greatest extent feasible. 
b.  WCFs utilize camouflage/concealment design techniques to avoid adverse impacts on the surrounding area;

    The rural subdivision process is available for applications including a minimum of eighty (80) acres of property. 
(Ord. 480 §4.9, 2003) 
Sec. 16-4-240. - Building lot location. 
(a)  The building lots shall be located to minimize the impact on any environmental or open space resource area on the property. They shall be sited in areas that are compatible with the special characteristics of the parcel and the surrounding area. In the case of undermining, the recommendations made in the geotechnical report must be followed. 
(b)  The lots shall be clustered to make efficient use of land resources and infrastructure. The lots shall also be clustered with respect to dwellings on surrounding properties. However, if clustering detracts from the natural characteristics of the parcel, the lots may be dispersed if approved by the Board of Trustees. 
(c)  The lots shall be located nearest to utilities and roads to minimize the amount of construction unless this directly conflicts with other preservation goals. 
(d)  Lot sizes and spacing will depend on the specific site and technical and environmental factors. 
(e)  Additional factors which shall be considered in siting the building lots include: 
(1)  Type of development in the surrounding area; 
(2)  Amount of land being preserved; 
(3)  Owner's desires for utilization of the land; 
(4)  Impact on infrastructure; 
(5)  Internal road impacts and vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including connections to existing and planned roads and trails; 
(6)  Surface and ground water quality; 
(7)  View corridors from and into the development; and

(Ord. 480 §4.9, 2003) 
Sec. 16-4-270. - Conservation density bonus. 
(a)  Approval Standards. A conservation density bonus that raises the maximum net density in a rural subdivision to one (1) unit per five (5) acres may be approved by the Board of Trustees if the Board determines that the proposed development complies with each provision of this Section. 
(b)  Open Space. In rural subdivisions with a conservation density bonus, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the property must be preserved as open space in a designated conservation area. All land within the conservation area shall be protected by a permanent conservation easement. Areas which must be included within the conservation area include land within the one-hundred-year floodplain (as defined by the Board of Trustees, the Colorado Water Conservation Board or FEMA), wetlands (as determined by the ecological characterization), valuable habitat areas (as determined by an ecological characterization; refer to Section 16-2-810 of this Code) and natural geologic hazard areas (as defined by the Colorado Geological Survey). 
(1)  To the maximum extent possible, the conservation area shall include one-hundred-foot buffers around natural areas and floodplains and all or part of the following: aquifer recharge areas, significant wildlife habitat and migration corridors, unique vegetation and critical plant communities, prime farmland, historic, archaeological or cultural features, ridgelines and scenic view corridors. 
(2)  The conservation area shall be designated as a single outlot unless an existing ditch, physical feature or road separates the preserved area in such a way as to make creating a single outlot infeasible. The existence of an historic site, wildlife habitat or other resource would also allow for the platting of separate outlots. 
(3)  Areas set aside for trail easements and peripheral roads may be considered part of the outlot. 
(4)  To the maximum extent feasible, the conservation area shall be connected with other conservation areas or open space parcels on adjacent land. 
(5)  Development Area. In rural subdivisions with density bonus, up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the property may be developed. 
(6)  Conservation Area Previously Subject to Conservation Easement. Property subject to a conservation easement recorded in the County Clerk and Recorder's office prior to the date an application for a rural subdivision is submitted may be considered to satisfy the seventy-five-percent open space requirement if the Board of Trustees determines on a case-by-case basis that such property and conservation easement both comply with this Section and the following criteria: 
a.  The subdivision has been located on the property to maximize the preservation of open space, including but not limited to agricultural areas, existing trees and vegetation, wildlife habitat and sensitive environmental areas such as riparian corridors, hazard areas, wetlands and floodplains; and 
b.  To the extent feasible given the topography and features of the property, the property subject to the conservation easement is contained in contiguous parcels and is not bisected by the proposed development. 
(Ord. 480 §4.9, 2003)

(Ord. 480 §4.13, 2003; Ord. 620 §1, 2010) 
Sec. 16-4-520. - Resubdivision. 
    The resubdivision of any lots, tracts or parcels, or the relocation or addition of streets within a subdivision, shall be considered a resubdivision (also known as a "replat") and shall be prepared and submitted in compliance with the requirements for a minor subdivision as set forth in this Article. In the event any dedicated streets are relocated as a result of a resubdivision, it is necessary for the Town to first vacate those existing streets, with said vacation to be effective prior to the approval of the final plat.

(Ord. 480 §4.14, 2003; Ord. 620 §1, 2010) 
Sec. 16-4-530. - Exceptions to design principles and development standards. 
(a)  Exception Purpose. An applicant may apply for an exception to the minimum community design principles and development standards specified in Article II of this Chapter, except for those standards that are not open to modification (see Subsection [d] below). The applicant shall submit an application for exception specifying the basis for the exception requested. The burden of demonstrating that an exception is justified falls solely on the applicant. An exception, as opposed to a variance, is not a request for relief from the strict application of the Zoning Code, but rather a request to modify a design principle or standard based on the specific conditions, circumstances or design context of a development proposal. 
(b)  Exception Application Process. The applicant shall submit a letter to the Town requesting an exception and providing justification thereof. The Town shall review the exemption application concurrently with a preliminary or final plat or PUD application. The Planning Commission shall review and make a recommendation of approval, approval with conditions or denial of an exception request at a regular meeting of the Planning Commission and forward such recommendation to the Board of Trustees as part of its review of the preliminary or final plat and/or preliminary or final PUD. Final action on the exception request shall be made by the Planning Commission or the Board of Trustees, depending on the application type and who has approval based on this Article. 
(c)  Exception Review Criteria. The Planning Commission and Board of Trustees shall use the following criteria to evaluate the applicant's exemption application: 
(1)  Special circumstances or conditions exist that limit the ability of the property to meet the community design principles and development standards set forth in Article II of this Chapter. Special circumstances or conditions include narrowness, unusual shape, exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situations. Financial difficulties, loss of prospective profits and previously approved exceptions in other subdivisions shall not be considered as special circumstances or conditions. 
(2)  An alternative design exists that will meet the intent of the standards and requirements set forth in Article II and this Article, by providing for the orderly subdivision of land and providing public facilities. The exception shall: 
a.  Provide for the orderly subdivision of land. The Town may require the development to be processed as a planned unit development or as a Mixed Use or Commercial Zone District site plan, if the complexity and interrelated design of the development more appropriately meet the intent of the PUD or mixed use zoning district processes. The PUD/mixed use process shall provide flexibility to review the exception as part of a creative and imaginative development design tailored to each unique site and the surrounding area; 
b.  Provide public facilities that will benefit the public without detriment to surrounding property owners or the Town's ability to provide services and maintain public facilities; and 
c.  Provide amenity to the development through design that could not be provided through the adopted standards. 
(3)  If granted, the exception will not be detrimental to the public interest or other property nor be in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan or other applicable provisions of this Municipal Code unless corresponding exceptions or variances are approved. 
(4)  The exception will not endanger public safety. 
(d)  Standards Not Open to Modification. The following community design principles and development standards specified in Article II of this Chapter are considered absolute minimum standards and are not open to modification through an exception process: 
(1)  Road standard (cross-section) for local street with sidewalk (Option "A"); 
(2)  Requirement of one (1) street tree of two-inch caliper for each forty (40) feet of frontage on both sides of the street (except for rural roads and alleys); 
(3)  Dedication of the full width of right-of-way for all platted streets; and 
(4)  Provision of handicap parking spaces. 
(e)  Restrictions on Requesting Exceptions. If an applicant requests an exception under this Section, the preliminary plat or preliminary PUD development plan shall whenever possible indicate the exceptions outlined in the application. Exception requests can be processed concurrently with preliminary and final plat and PUD applications.

If the Board of Trustees or respective special district determines that any of the required improvements are not constructed in compliance with specifications, it shall furnish the subdivider with a list of specific deficiencies and shall be entitled to withhold collateral sufficient to ensure such compliance. If the Board of Trustees determines that the subdivider will not construct any or all of the improvements or remedy the deficiencies in accordance with all the specifications, the Board of Trustees may withdraw and employ from the deposit of collateral such funds as may be necessary to construct the improvements or remedy deficiencies in accordance with the specifications. 
(d)  The following improvements shall be constructed unless waived by the Board of Trustees:

(e)  Time for Completion. The required time for the completion of all required improvements shall be two (2) years from the recording date of the final map or plat. However, the Board of Trustees may extend such time for completion upon request from the subdivider. Upon completion of such improvements within the required time and approval thereof by the Board of Trustees, the Town shall cause the cash or letter of credit to be released within thirty (30) days of the Town's acceptance of such improvements and receipt of the required as-built drawings. When such improvements are not completed within the required time, the Town may cause the proceeds of the cash or letter of credit to be used to complete the required improvements. 
(f)  Warranty. All workmanship and materials for all required improvements shall be warranted by the subdivider for a period of two (2) years from the date of the Town's acceptance of the required improvement; provided that any defects which are the result of public abuse, misuse or acts of God are not the responsibility of said subdivider. For perimeter fences that abut collector and arterial streets, the warranty period shall be two (2) years. The total amount of the guarantee shall be calculated as ten percent (10%) of the total estimated cost, including labor and materials, of all public improvements to be constructed. The Town shall not release the improvement guarantee until the Town has granted final acceptance of the improvements. In the event that any other provision of this Code or specifications adopted pursuant thereto requires a warranty of workmanship or materials for a different period of time, that provision requiring the longer period shall govern. The inspection or acceptance of any required improvement by the Town shall not relieve the subdivider of his or her warranty of workmanship and materials.

CHAPTER 16 
Land Use Code 
ARTICLE V - Vesting of Property Rights 

Sec. 16-5-10. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Section is to provide the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., which establishes a vested property right to undertake and complete development of real property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan. No vested rights shall be created within the Town except through a site specific development plan. 
(Ord. 480 §5.1, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-20. - Definitions. 
    As used in this Section, unless the context otherwise requires: 
    Landowner means any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, and includes the heirs, successors and assigns of such ownership interests. 
    Property means all real property subject to land use regulation by the Town of Milliken. 
    Site specific development plan means and is limited to the final plat of a subdivision or a final site plan of a PUD Planned Unit Development District (also known as a final PUD development plan ) when approved by the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly adopted. 
    Vested property rights means the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of a site specific development plan. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-30. - Request for site specific development plan approval. 
    For those developments for which the landowner wishes the creation of vested property rights pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., the landowner shall request the approval in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the date said approval is to be considered. Failure of the landowner to request such an approval renders the plan not a site specific development plan, and no vested property rights shall be deemed to have been created. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-40. - Notice and hearing. 
    No site specific development plan shall be approved until after a public hearing called for that purpose, preceded by notice of such hearing published as provided by law at least twenty-one (21) days before the hearing. Such notice may, at the Town's option, be combined with any other required notice. At such hearing, all interested persons shall have an opportunity to be heard. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003l; Ord. 522, 2005) 
Sec. 16-5-50. - Approvals, effective date, amendments, referendum and review. 
(a)  A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the ordinance granting final approval of the plan. The vested property right shall attach to and run with the applicable property and shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site specific development plan, including any amendments thereto. 
(b)  The Board of Trustees may approve a site specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditional approval will result in a vested property right, although failure to abide by such terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested property rights. 
(c)  In the event amendments to a site specific development plan are approved, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of duration of a vested property right, shall be the date of the approval of the original site specific development plan, unless the Board of Trustees specifically finds to the contrary and incorporates such findings in its approval of the amendment. 
(d)  The approval of vested property rights shall be subject to all rights of referendum and judicial review; except that the period of time permitted by law for the exercise of such rights shall not begin to run until the date of publication of a notice to the general public of the site specific development plan and creation of vested property rights. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-60. - Notice of approval. 
(a)  Each map, plat or site plan or other document constituting a site specific development plan shall contain the following notice: "Approval of this plan may create a vested property right pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended." Failure to contain this statement shall invalidate the creation of the vested property right. 
(b)  In addition, the Town shall publish a notice describing generally the type and intensity of the use approved and the specific parcel or parcels of property affected, and stating that a vested property right has been created. The notice shall be published once, not more than fourteen (14) days after approval of the site specific development plan, in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-70. - Duration of vested property right. 
    A property right which has been vested as provided herein shall remain vested for a period of three (3) years; except that the Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, grant vested property rights for a longer period when warranted in light of all relevant circumstance, including but not limited to the size and phasing of the development, economic cycles and market conditions. The vesting period shall not be extended by any amendments to a site specific development plan unless expressly authorized by the Board of Trustees in the ordinance approving such amendments. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-80. - Other provisions unaffected. 
    Approval of a site specific development plan shall not constitute an exemption or waiver of any other provisions of this Code pertaining to the development or use of property. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-90. - Payment of costs. 
    In addition to any and all other fees and charges imposed by this Code, the applicant for approval of a site specific development plan shall pay all costs occasioned to the Town pertaining to such application, including but not limited to publication of notices, public hearing and review costs, county recording fees and review costs. The site specific development plan shall not be recorded until all fees have been paid. 
(Ord. 480 §5.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-5-100. - Limitations. 
    Nothing in this Article is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. In the event of the repeal of said Article or a judicial determination that said Article is invalid or unconstitutional, this Article shall be deemed to be repealed, and the provisions hereof no longer effective.

CHAPTER 16 
Land Use Code 
ARTICLE VII - Sign Code[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 739 , § 1, adopted March 23, 2017, repealed the former Art. VII and enacted a new Art. VII as set out herein. The former Art. VII, §§ 16-7-10-16-7-130 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 523 §1, adopted in 2005; and Ord. 658 §1, adopted in 2012. 

Sec. 16-7-10. - Purpose/intent/interpretation. 
(a)  Signs can obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The regulations in this Article are intended to coordinate the use, placement, physical dimensions and design of all signs within the Town. The purpose of these regulations is to: 
(1)  Recognize that signs are a necessary means of visual communication for the convenience of the public and provide flexibility within the sign review/approval process to allow for unique circumstances and creativity. 
(2)  Recognize and ensure the right of those concerned to identify businesses, services and other activities by the use of signs, and limit commercial signs to those which are accessory and incidental to the use on the premises where such signs are located. 
(3)  Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of commercial signs and similar devices. 
(4)  Protect the public from damage or injury caused by signs that are poorly designed or maintained and from distractions or hazards to pedestrians or motorists caused by the indiscriminate placement or use of signs. 
(5)  Ensure signs are well designed and contribute in a positive way to the Town's visual environment, express local character and help develop a distinctive image for the Town. 
(6)  Encourage signs that are responsive to the aesthetics and character of their particular location, adjacent buildings and uses and the surrounding neighborhood and are compatible and integrated with the building's architectural design and with other signs on the property. 
(7)  Ensure signs are appropriate for the type of street on which they are located. 
(8)  Sign shall not detract from the character of an architecturally significant or historic structure. 
(9)  Bring nonconforming signs into compliance with these regulations when the use of the property changes or is discontinued, when a new business license is issued or as a condition of approval of a land use action approved by the Town, such as a rezoning, variance or other land use action. 
(10)  Assist in wayfinding. 
(11)  Regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. 
(12)  Promote efficient communication of messages. 
(13)  Promote public welfare by reducing visual clutter. 
(14)  Recognize that signs advertising discontinued commercial uses are misleading, unnecessarily contribute to visual clutter, and can unnecessarily obstruct views and distract motorists. 
(b)  This Article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This Article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. 
(c)  A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this Article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in this Article. 
(d)  This Article does not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the Town. Rather, it is intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one (1) or more of the purposes set forth above. 
(e)  This Article does not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, it strikes an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
(f)  This Article is not intended to and does not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the state, the federal government or the Town. The inclusion of "government" in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps illustrate the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation. 
(g)  With respect to permitted hazard warning signs, the Board finds that the dispersed nature of utility, oil and gas lines and other potential hazards throughout all the community does not lend itself to the property by property regulation otherwise used in this Code, and that warning of the location of utilities and of their hazards so that persons will not be injured thereby, so that fire, police, and other public emergency services may be conducted all expeditiously and safely, and so that the essential public functions served by such utilities will not be impaired constitutes a compelling governmental interest and requires a different form of regulation; 
(h)  Except as this Article expressly provides, the Board does not intend to regulate signs based upon the content of any sign's message. 
(i)  Where this Article uses the terms "shall" or "must" to express rules, requirements, or standards, compliance is mandatory, and noncompliance is grounds for denial of any required sign permit and a violation of this Article. Where this Article uses the terms "should", "encouraged", "desirable" or similar terms, to express an expectation, compliance is encouraged, but not required, and noncompliance is not grounds for denial of a sign permit and shall not constitute a violation of this Article. 
(Ord. 739 §1, 3-23-2017) 
Sec. 16-7-20. - Sign permits and administration.

In multiple-occupant buildings, a separate permit shall be required for each business entity's sign. Separate building and electrical permits may be required for signs. Neither servicing and maintenance of existing signs nor changing or replacing the copy on an existing lawful sign shall require a permit.

f.  A graphic drawing or photograph of the sign copy; 
g.  A description of the lighting to be used, if applicable; 
h.  If the sign is to be located off the applicant's own premises, a written lease or permission from the property owner of the site on which the sign will be located; and 
i.  Sign permit fee as established by the current fee schedule. The applicant shall pay all costs billed by the Town relative to the review of the application. 
j.  Sufficient information to determine whether the proposed sign is allowed under this Article and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. 
k.  The date when the applicant intends to erect the sign. 
l.  For a temporary sign, the dates intended for the erection and removal of the sign. 
(2)  Sign Permit Application Certification of Completion. Staff will review application for completeness and either certify the application is in compliance of all submittal requirements or reject it as incomplete and notify the applicant in writing of any deficiencies. 
(3)  Staff Review and Approval. Within seven (7) business days of determination of a complete application, Staff shall review the sign permit in accordance with the established review criteria and shall, approve, approve with conditions or deny the sign permit. Staff must approve any application that complies with all provisions of this Article and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. Upon Staff's approval of the sign permit, the sign permit and any building or electrical permits required for the sign shall be issued to the applicant. Upon denying an application the Staff shall provide the applicant with a written statement of the reasons for that action in writing. 
(d)  Sign Permit Review Criteria. The following review criteria will be used by the Town Staff to evaluate all sign permit applications: 
(1)  Sign meets the requirements of this Article; 
(2)  Sign conforms to the requirements of the Building and Electrical Code as adopted by the Town; 
(3)  Sign conforms to the size, height, material and location requirements of the Zoning Code for the zoning district in which it is located; 
(4)  Sign would not interfere with pedestrian or vehicular safety; 
(5)  Signs mounted on buildings would not obscure architecture; 
(6)  Electrical signs must be approved by an independent testing laboratory. 
(e)  Appeal of Sign Permit Denial or Approval with Conditions. Any appeal of Staff's denial of a sign permit or approval with conditions shall be made to the Board of Adjustment as provided in the Zoning Code. Except for delay caused by or with the consent of the applicant, Staff and the Board of Adjustment shall promptly process the appeal. At the next available Board meeting after the applicant files its notice of appeal, the Board shall conduct a hearing and issue a decision on that appeal. The hearing may be held no less than ten (10) days from the date of advertising.

Sec. 16-7-40. - Enforcement.

(Ord. 739 §1, 3-23-2017) 
Sec. 16-7-70. - Measurement of sign area and height. 
(a)  Sign Surface Area. The area of a geometric shape enclosing any message, logo, symbol, name, photograph or display face shall be measured using standard mathematical formulas. Regular geometric shapes shall include, but not be limited to, squares, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, circles, ellipses or combinations thereof. The total measured area of a sign shall include the area of all writing, representation, lines, emblems or figures contained within all modules, together with any air space, material or color forming an integral part or background of the display if used to differentiate such sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. The total surface area of all sign faces shall be counted and considered to be part of the maximum total sign area allowance. 
(b)  Sign Support. Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area. 
(c)  Back-to-Back (Double-Faced) Signs. Back-to-back signs shall be regarded as a single sign only if mounted on a single structure, and the distance between each sign face does not exceed two (2) feet at any point. 
_____
Figure 7-1
Sign Area Measurement 

_____
(d)  Three-Dimensional Signs. Where a sign consists of one (1) or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. Signs with three-dimensional objects that exceed a projection of six (6) inches from the sign face may be approved in compliance with Section 16-7-130 below. 
(e)  Wall Signs. If a sign is attached to a wall, only that portion of the wall onto which the sign face or letters are placed shall be calculated in the sign area. 
(f)  Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from the highest point of a sign to the ground surface beneath it. The ground surface shall mean the average grade within five (5) feet of the base. When berms are used in conjunction with signage or there are significant changes in grade, the height of the sign shall be measured from the mean elevation of the fronting street.

(Ord. 739 §1, 3-23-2017) 
Sec. 16-7-80. - Sign design. 
(a)  Sign Location and Placement. 
(1)  Visibility - Signs should not visually obscure architectural features. The following illustrations are examples of design that the Town is encouraging. 
Figure 7-3
Visibility 

_____ 
(2)  Integrate signs with the building and landscaping - Signs should be carefully coordinated with the architectural design, overall color scheme and landscaping. Signs should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs for a building. 
(3)  Unified sign band - Whenever possible, signs located on buildings with the same block-face should be placed at the same height, in order to create a unified sign band. Wall signs should be located at the first floor level only for retail commercial uses. 
(4)  Monument signs - Monument signs should be located in a planter setting within a landscaped area at the primary entries to residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions to provide an overall project identity. A maximum of one (1) monument sign per entry shall be permitted. 
(5)  Pedestrian-oriented signs - Pedestrian-oriented signs are encouraged. It is desirable to include a pedestrian-oriented sign as one (1) of the signs for a business. These signs should be designed for and physically directed toward pedestrians so they can easily and comfortably read the sign as they stand adjacent to the business. 
(6)  Road right-of-way - No sign shall be erected within the road right-of-way or near the intersection of any roads or driveways in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision of motorists or pedestrians or at any location where, by reason of the position, shape or color, it may interfere with, obstruct the view of or be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal or device. Signs located at an intersection must be outside of the sight distance triangle. 
(b)  Landscaping. Freestanding signs should be landscaped at their base in a way harmonious with the landscape concept for the whole site. Landscaping should form an attractive, dense cluster at the base of the sign that is equally attractive in winter and summer. 
_____
Figure 7-4
Landscaping 

_____
(c)  Reduce Sign Impact. Because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity, signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. Small-scale signs are encouraged. 
Figure 7-5
Sign Impact 

_____
(d)  Color. 
(1)  Select Colors Carefully. Colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Sign colors should complement the colors used on the structures and the project as a whole. Colors or combinations of colors that are harsh and disrupt the visual harmony and order of the street are unacceptable. 
(2)  Use Contrasting Colors. Signs should provide a substantial contrast between the color and the material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read during both the day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. 
(3)  Avoid Using Too Many Colors. Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided. 
(e)  Materials. Signs should be constructed of durable, high quality architectural materials. The sign package must use materials, colors and designs that are compatible with the building façade. Sign materials must be of proven durability. Treated wood, painted metal, stone, brick and stucco are the encouraged materials for signs. 
(f)  Legibility. Signs should be adequately legible under the circumstances in which they are primarily seen. The legibility of signs is related to: 
(1)  The speed at which they are viewed; 
(2)  The context and surroundings in which they are seen; and 
(3)  The design, colors and contrast of the sign copy and sign face. 
(4)  The design of the sign including copy, lettering size and style and colors should logically relate to the average speed of the traffic which will see it. Signs should legibly convey their messages without being distracting or unsafe to motorists reading them. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words whenever appropriate. 
(g)  Sign Illumination. 
(1)  Signs should have illumination only if necessary. 
(2)  Sign illumination should complement, not overpower, the overall composition of the site. 
Figure 7-6
Existing Illumination 

(3)  Use a direct light source. All lighted signs shall have their lighting directed in such a manner as to illuminate only the face of the sign. When external light sources are directed at the sign surface, the light source must be concealed from pedestrians' and motorists' "lines of sight." 
Figure 7-7
Direct Light Source 

(4)  Signs must be illuminated in a way that does not cause glare onto the street and adjacent properties. Signs shall be lighted only to the intensity level of more than 0.3 foot-candles over ambient light as measured at a distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet and shall be equipped with a fully operational light sensor that automatically adjusts the intensity of the lighting according to the amount of ambient light; 
(5)  Every electric sign shall have affixed thereon an approved Underwriters' Laboratories label. All lighted signs shall meet all applicable electrical codes and the electrical components used shall bear the label of an approval agency. Additionally, electrical permits shall be obtained for electric signs. 
(6)  Flashing, moving, blinking, chasing or other animation effects shall be prohibited on all signs. 
(7)  Neon tubing is an acceptable method of sign illumination for window signs in commercial districts. 
(8)  The use of individually cut, backlit letter signs is encouraged. 
(9)  Lighting behind sign faces may only illuminate the symbol or message through a translucent material; the rest of the sign shall be opaque. 
(10)  No commercial sign within three hundred (300) linear feet of any property which contains an existing or approved residential use or is zoned for residential use, may be illuminated between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. This time limitation shall not apply to any lighting which is used primarily for the protection of the premises or for safety purposes or any signage which is separated from a residential use by an arterial street. For purposes of this Subsection, the term approved shall mean having final plat approval. 
(Ord. 739 §1, 3-23-2017) 
Sec. 16-7-90. - Sign installation and maintenance. 
(a)  Installation. 
(1)  All signs shall be mounted so that the method of installation is concealed to the maximum extent possible. 
(2)  Projecting signs shall be mounted so they generally align with others in the block. 
(3)  All signs and all components thereof, including sign structures and sign faces, shall be kept neatly painted, in a good state of repair and in compliance with all building and electrical codes. The Town may inspect any sign governed by this Article and shall have the authority to order the painting, repair, alteration or removal of a sign which constitutes a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or obsolescence. 
(4)  Owners of projecting signs extending over public right-of-way shall be required to maintain public liability insurance in an amount to be determined appropriate by the Town, in which the Town is named as an "other insured." 
(b)  Maintenance. 
(1)  The owner of a sign and the owner of the premises on which such sign is located shall be jointly and severally liable to maintain such sign, including any illumination sources, in neat and orderly condition and in a good working order at all times, and to prevent the development of any rust, corrosion, rotting or other deterioration in the physical appearance or safety of such sign. The sign must also be in compliance with all building and electrical codes. 
(2)  The owner of any sign regulated by this Article shall be required to keep signs and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, structurally safe, clean, free of visible defects and functioning properly at all times. Repairs to signs shall be equal to or better in quality of materials and design than the original sign. 
(3)  The Town may inspect any sign governed by this Article and shall have the authority to order the painting, repair, alteration or removal of a sign which constitutes a hazard to safety, health or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or obsolescence.

However, such signs may project horizontally from the face of a canopy the distance necessary to accommodate the letter thickness and required electrical equipment but not more than twelve (12) inches (measured from the bottom of the sign). Under-canopy signs, which are perpendicular to the face of the building, shall be deemed to be projecting wall signs. Under-canopy signs that are parallel to the face of the building shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet above grade and shall be deemed to be flush wall signs. 
(c)  Freestanding Signs. 
Example of Freestanding Sign 

(1)  Location. The sign may be located only on a site frontage adjoining a public street. 
a.  When a freestanding sign is placed on a lot with two (2) or more street frontages, such sign shall be said to be adjacent to a particular street frontage when it is located closer to that street frontage than any other street frontage. 
b.  If a lot has more than one (1) street frontage, the freestanding sign permitted for each frontage must be located adjacent to the street frontage that is the basis for the allotment of such sign. 
c.  No freestanding sign shall be built within fifteen (15) feet of any interior side lot line. The minimum horizontal distance between freestanding or monument signs located on the same lot shall be seventy-five (75) feet. 
d.  The sign face of a single face sign must be most nearly parallel to the street frontage to which it is adjacent. The sign faces of a multiface sign must be most nearly perpendicular to the street frontage to which they are adjacent. 
(2)  Setback. The setback of any freestanding sign shall be measured from the street right-of-way line of the street frontage that is the basis for the allotment of such sign. Any such setback shall be measured perpendicularly from the street right-of-way line to the nearest portion of the sign face or structure. 
(3)  Maximum number of signs. No more than one (1) freestanding or monument sign per street frontage shall be permitted for any property. A drive-in restaurant, when located on a lot with frontage on only one (1) street, shall be permitted one (1) additional freestanding or monument sign.

(5)  Electrical service. When electrical service is provided to freestanding signs or monument signs, all such electrical service shall be underground. 
(6)  Supporting structure materials. All supporting structures of monument signs shall be of the same or similar materials or colors of the associated buildings which house the businesses or activities advertised on the sign. 
(7)  Sign mounting. The sign shall be mounted on one (1) or more posts or have a solid monument-type base. Posts shall not have a diameter greater than twelve (12) inches. 
(8)  Sign pole signs. Pole signs should not be so large as to obscure the patterns of front façades and yards. 
(9)  Site distance triangle. This requirement applies to freestanding and monument signs. 
a.  Monument signs which exceed forty-two (42) inches in height, and freestanding signs which do not maintain free air space between a height of forty-two (42) inches and seventy-two (72) inches above the adjacent street elevation, shall be set back from the right-of-way line a distance as established in the sight distance triangle table contained in this Subsection. A freestanding sign shall not be construed to have free air space if such sign has a base the width of which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the width of its face or three (3) feet, whichever is smaller. In addition, freestanding and monument signs shall not be located closer to the right-of-way line than allowed in the tables below that apply to such signs. 
Figure 7-9
Sight Distance Triangle 

b.  The leading edge of freestanding signs shall not extend past the property line. At intersections where sight distance triangles apply, freestanding signs shall not be placed within the applicable sight distance triangle nor in any manner that impedes visibility or public safety. The following chart shall be used to determine the sight distance triangle: 
Sight Distance Triangle Table -
Distances measured from flow line Type of Street Y Distance

(in feet) Arterial Right 135 
Left 270 15 Collector Right 120 
Left 220 15 Local Right 100 
Left 150 15  
(d)  Monument Signs. 

(1)  Location. The sign may be located only along a site frontage adjoining a public street. The sign may not be located in the site distance triangle (refer to Subparagraphs 16-7-100(c)(9)a. and b. above for details). 
(2)  Design. The design of a monument sign should be consistent with the overall scale of the building. The design and placement of the sign shall not obstruct traffic safety sight distance areas. 
(3)  Landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided at the base of the supporting structure equal to twice the area of one (1) face of the sign and supporting structure. For example, twenty (20) square feet of sign area equals forty (40) square feet of landscaped area. The Planning Commission may reduce or waive this requirement if it is determined that the additional landscaping would not contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic character of the project. 
(4)  Setback. The setback of any freestanding sign shall be measured from the street right-of-way line of the street frontage that is the basis for the allotment of such sign. Any such setback shall be measured perpendicularly from the street right-of-way line to the nearest portion of the sign face or structure. 
(5)  Maximum number of signs. No more than one (1) freestanding or monument sign per street frontage shall be permitted for any property. A drive-in restaurant, when located on a lot with frontage on only one (1) street, shall be permitted one (1) additional freestanding or ground sign. Such sign shall not exceed five (5) feet in height, thirty-five (35) square feet in area and shall be limited to one (1) face. Fifty percent (50%) of the square footage of such sign shall be exempted from the total allowed for the property. 
(6)  Maximum area and height. The sign shall comply with the height and area requirements below.

Projecting Sign 

(1)  Location. Projecting signs shall be placed only on a ground floor façade, except for businesses located above the ground level with direct exterior pedestrian access. Mount projecting signs so they generally align with others in the block. This helps to create a "canopy line" that gives scale to the sidewalk. 
(2)  Maximum area and height. Projecting signs shall not be higher than the wall from which the sign projects if attached to a single-story building or the height of the bottom of any second-story window if attached to a multistory building. Projecting signs must have eight (8) feet clearance and may not extend more than four (4) feet from the building wall, except where the sign is an integral part of an approved canopy or awning. The size of projecting signs is limited to sixteen (16) square feet. 
(3)  Sign structure. Sign supports and brackets shall be compatible with the design and scale of the sign. 
(4)  Quantity. The number of projecting signs is limited to one (1) per business tenant, to a maximum of two (2). Projecting signs are not permitted in conjunction with pole signs. 
(f)  Wall Signs. 
Example of a Wall Sign 

(1)  Location. The sign shall not be placed to obstruct any portion of a window, doorway or other architectural detail. Locate wall signs on buildings at the first-floor level only for retail uses. No part of a wall sign shall be located more than twenty-five (25) feet above grade level. 
(2)  Maximum area and height. Wall signs shall not be higher than the eave line of the principal building. Wall signs shall not exceed one (1) square foot per linear foot of building frontage at ground level and three-quarters (3/4) square foot per linear foot of second-story building frontage. The sign shall comply with the height and area requirements established in Section 16-7-120 below. 
(3)  Projection from wall. No sign part, including cut-out letters, may project from the surface upon which it is attached more than required for construction purposes. Single-sided wall signs allowed when suspended from front porch. 
(g)  Window Signs. A window sign is a sign that is painted on, applied or attached to a window or that can be read through the window from the public right-of-way, placed at or below the second floor level. 
(1)  Maximum area. When a sign is displayed in a window and is visible beyond the boundaries of the lot upon which the sign is displayed, the total area of such sign shall not exceed: 
a.  Forty percent (40%) of the window or door area at the ground floor level; and 
b.  Forty percent (40%) of the total allowable sign area for the premises. 
(2)  Lighting. All illuminated window signs shall be included in the total allowable sign area for the premises. Temporary posters announcing or advertising events sponsored by noncommercial organizations shall be exempt from limitations for window signs.

Sec. 16-7-130. - Substitution. 
    Subject to the land owner's consent, a non-commercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed non-commercial message; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this Article. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any other non-commercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted. 
(Ord. 739 §1, 3-23-2017) 
Sec. 16-7-140. - Severability. 
    If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Article shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability of such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this Article, the intent being that the same are severable.

CHAPTER 16 
Land Use Code 
ARTICLE VIII - Floodplain Areas 

Sec. 16-8-10. - Statutory authorization. 
    The State Legislature has, in Section 31-23-301, C.R.S., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 480 §8.1, 2003) 
Sec. 16-8-20. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 480 §8.2, 2003) 
Sec. 16-8-30. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 480 §8.3, 2003) 
Sec. 16-8-40. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this Article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 480 §8.4, 2003) 
Sec. 16-8-50. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this Article its most reasonable application: 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the Town Clerk's interpretation of any provision of this Article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the Town. 
    Expansion to existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than six (6) inches. Letters of Map Revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system that consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this Article. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle. This term also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. This definition is for the purpose of this Article only. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of Ordinance No. 137. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations; or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the Article or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, addition or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either: 
a.  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
b.  If the structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this Article that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in NFIP Standards § 603(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the NAVD of 1988 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(d)  The Town Clerk and Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the relevant factors in Section 16-8-150 above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this Article, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Article. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a finding of all of the following factors: 
a.  Showing of a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or Articles. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by the Town for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in Subsections (a) through (j) above are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. 686 §2, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-180. - Specific standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 16-8-70 or Subsection 16-8-170 of this Article, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities outlined in Section 16-8-230 of this Article, new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that at one (1) foot above the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this Subsection. Such certification shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator as proposed in Section 16-8-150 above. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

(Ord. 686 §2, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-185. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the special flood hazard area established in Section 16-8-70 of this Article are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions are applicable to all areas of shallow flooding: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the Town's FIRM (or at least three [3] feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities outlined in Section 16-8-230 of this Article, all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the Town's FIRM (at least three [3] feet if no depth number is specified) or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Section 16-8-130 of this Article, are satisfied. Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 686 §2, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-190. - Floodways. 
    Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State and the Town have adopted floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard. Areas located within a special flood hazard area as established in Section 16-8-70 of this Article are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply to floodways: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado professional engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge (requires a no-rise certification). 
(2)  If Paragraph (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Section. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R., Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, the Town may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. 686 §2, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-200. - Alteration of watercourse. 
    For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a special flood hazard area, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project, as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. 
(2)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain. 
(3)  Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and articles. 
(4)  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer or certified professional hydrologist. 
(5)  All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and local floodplain requirements and regulations. 
(6)  Within the regulatory floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report that there is not more than a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions resulting from the project as compared to existing conditions, unless the Town first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision in accordance with Section 16-8-150 of this Article. This is also known as a no-rise certification. The analysis and report must be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer. 
(7)  Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(Ord. 686 §3, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-210. - Properties removed from floodplain by fill. 
    A floodplain development permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), unless such new structure or addition complies with the following requirements: 
(1)  Residential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(Ord. 686 §3, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-220. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision or other development proposal is in a flood-prone area, the proposal shall minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of Section 16-8-75, Section 16-8-150 and the provisions of Sections 16-8-170 through 16-8-230 of this Article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 16-8-70 or Section 16-8-140 of this Article. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. 686 §3, 2013) 
Sec. 16-8-230. - Standards for critical facilities. 
    A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that, if flooded, may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the Board of Trustees to identify and confirm that specific structures in its community meet the following criteria. Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) essential services; (b) hazardous materials; (c) at-risk populations; and (d) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage and emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions and nonambulatory surgical structures, but excluding clinics, doctors' offices and nonurgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables and conduits); 
5.  Public facility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines and service lines); and 
6.  Air transportation lifelines (airports [municipal and larger], helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions and associated infrastructure [aviation control towers, air traffic control centers and emergency equipment aircraft hangars]). Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), nonpotable water treatment and distribution systems and hydroelectric power-generating plants and related appurtenances. Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board of Trustees that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Article and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the Board of Trustees on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place and the chemical is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this Article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
Specific exemptions to this category include: 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority), that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this Article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care and schools. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Elder care (nursing homes); 
2.  Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (day care and assisted living); 
3.  Public and private schools (preschools, K-12 schools, before-school and after-school care serving twelve [12] or more children); 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services, including government operations. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
2.  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the Board of Trustees that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the Board of Trustees on an as-needed basis upon request. 
(2)  Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the special flood hazard area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this Article, protection shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  Location outside the special flood hazard area; or 
b.  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. 
(3)  Ingress and egress for new critical facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the Board of Trustees, have continuous noninundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event. 
(Ord. 686 §3, 2013) 
ARTICLE IX - Oil and Gas Drilling and Production 

Sec. 16-9-10. - Purpose. 
(a)  These regulations are enacted to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of the Town. It is the Town's intent by enacting these regulations to facilitate and mitigate potential land use conflicts between such development and existing, as well as planned, land uses. It is recognized that under Colorado law the surface and mineral estates are separate and distinct interests in land and that one may be severed from the other. Owners of oil and gas interests have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to use that part of the surface estate reasonably required to extract and develop their subsurface oil and gas interests, subject to compliance with the provisions of these regulations and any other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The State has a recognized interest in the fostering of efficient development, production and utilization of oil and gas resources and particularly in the prevention of waste and protection of the correlative rights of common surface owners and producers to a fair and equitable share of production therefrom. Similarly, owners of the surface estate have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to have the mineral estate developed with reasonable accommodation and to have adverse land use impacts upon their property, associated with the development of the mineral estate, mitigated through compliance with these regulations so long as these regulations do not create operational conflict with the State's authority to regulate oil and gas development. 
(b)  Local governments have a recognized, traditional authority and responsibility to regulate land use within their jurisdiction, including use for oil and gas drilling. These regulations are intended as exercise of this land use authority to the extent that they do not create an operational conflict. 
(c)  The Town recognizes that this Article does not supersede or preempt the regulations of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission or any other State regulations nor is this Article intended to conflict with those regulations. The Town acknowledges the authority of the COGCC and the application of its rules to oil and gas drilling and production operations within the Town's boundaries, confirms that the COGCC's regulations govern oil and gas drilling and production operations in the Town and, therefore, adopts the COGCC's regulations as of passage of this Article. To the extent the COGCC's regulations change in the future, the Town will use the provisions in this Code as a default for oil and gas operations within the Town's jurisdiction. The Town further acknowledges that a Permit to Drill issued by the COGCC shall be binding with respect to any operationally conflicting requirement under this Article. 
(d)  This Article is meant to repeal all previous regulations regarding oil and gas drilling operations and inspections within the Town. This includes, but is not limited to: Ordinance #480 passed in 2003, which replaced Ordinance #253 passed in 1988, which replaced the original Ordinance #159 passed in 1983. 
(Ord. 636 §1, 2010) 
Sec. 16-9-15. - General provisions. 
(a)  The provisions of this Article shall apply to all oil and gas exploration and production operations proposed on or beneath property within the Town limits. 
(b)  Oil and gas facilities within Town limits and in place prior to March 11, 1983, will be considered legal nonconforming uses, however, such facilities must be registered with the Town. The operator must supply the Town with copies of the site plan, operating plan, reclamation plan, as-builts and fire and emergency response plans pursuant to this Article. 
(c)  Where provisions in this Chapter are in conflict with other provisions of this Code or other applicable regulations, the more restrictive, or that provision which results in the higher standard, shall apply unless the application of the Code results in an operational conflict with the State regulation of oil and gas development. 
(d)  Exceptions to the provisions of this Article may be granted by the Planning Commission. If such exception is part of the approval process of the Special Use Permit, then the exception shall only be approved if the applicant demonstrates that the exception or waiver is necessary to prevent waste or protect correlative rights and can provide adequate mitigation measures for the Town standards waived. Decisions of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Board of Trustees as provided for in Section 16-3-520. Appeals must be filed within one (1) month of the Planning Commission's written decision. 
(e)  Use tax. All operators must conform to applicable provisions of this Code relating to taxation.

(Ord. 480 §11.7, 2003) 
Sec. 16-11-80. - Landmark alteration application and review. 
(a)  An owner of property designated as a landmark or located in an historic district may apply for a landmark alteration certificate, including all information which the Planning Commission determines is necessary to consider the application, including without limitation plans and specifications showing the proposed exterior appearance, with texture, materials and architectural design and detail, and the names and addresses of the abutting property owners. 
(b)  Upon receipt of an application for an alteration certificate, the Planning Commission shall submit that application, together with a recommendation thereon, to the Board of Trustees for final approval. 
(Ord. 480 §11.8, 2003) 
Sec. 16-11-90. - Criteria for review of an alteration certificate. 
(a)  The Board of Trustees shall issue an alteration certificate for any proposed work on a designated historical site or district only if the Board of Trustees determines that the proposed work would not detrimentally alter, destroy or adversely affect any architectural or landscape feature which contributes to the original historical designation. The Board of Trustees must find that a proposed development is visually compatible with designated historic structures located on the property in terms of design, finish, material, scale, mass and height. When the subject site is an historic district, the Board of Trustees must also find that the proposed development is visually compatible with the development on adjacent properties. For purposes of this Article, the term compatible shall mean consistent with, harmonious with and/or enhancing the mixture of complementary architectural styles either of the architecture of an individual structure or the character of the surrounding structures. 
(b)  The Board of Trustees will use the following criteria to determine compatibility: 
(1)  The effect upon the general historical and architectural character of the structure and property. 
(2)  The architectural style, arrangement, texture and material used on the existing and proposed structures and their relation and compatibility with other structures. 
(3)  The size of the structure, its setbacks, site, location and the appropriateness thereof when compared to existing structures and the site. 
(4)  The compatibility of accessory structures and fences with the main structure on the site, and with other structures. 
(5)  The effects of the proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or otherwise impacting the exterior architectural features of the structure upon which such work is done. 
(6)  The condition of existing improvements and whether they are a hazard to public health and safety. 
(7)  The effects of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the property. 
(8)  Compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as listed below: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. When the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
1.  New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. To protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment, the new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size scale and architectural features. 
2.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. 480 §11.9, 2003) 
Sec. 16-11-100. - Relocation criteria. 
    The Board of Trustees shall use the following criteria in considering alteration certificate applications for relocating a landmark, a structure on an historic site, a building or structure within an historic district, a structure onto a landmark site, or a structure to property in an historic district: 
(1)  For consideration of the original site, the Board of Trustees will review for compliance with all of the following criteria: 
a.  Documentation showing the structure cannot be rehabilitated or reused on its original site to provide for any reasonable beneficial use of the property; 
b.  The contribution the structure makes to its present setting; 
c.  Whether plans are specifically defined for the site to be vacated, and have been approved by Staff; 
d.  If the structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity and the applicant can show the relocation activity is the best preservation method for the character and integrity of the structure; 
e.  Whether the structure has been demonstrated to be capable of withstanding the physical impacts of the relocation and re-siting; and 
f.  Whether a structural report submitted by a licensed structural engineer adequately demonstrates the soundness of the structure proposed for relocation. 
(2)  For consideration of the new location, the Board of Trustees will review for compliance with all of the following criteria: 
a.  Whether the building or structure is compatible with its proposed site and adjacent properties, and if the receiving site is compatible in nature with the structure proposed to be moved; 
b.  The structure's architectural integrity and its consistency with the character of the neighborhood; 
c.  Whether the relocation of the historic structure would diminish the integrity or character of the neighborhood of the receiving site; and 
d.  If a relocation plan has been submitted and approved by Staff, including posting a bond, to ensure the safe relocation, preservation and repair (if required) of the structure, site preparation and infrastructure connections as described in this Code. 
(Ord. 480 §11.10, 2003) 
Sec. 16-11-110. - Exemptions from alteration certificate requirements. 
    An applicant may request an exemption from the alteration certificate requirements set forth herein. The applicant must provide adequate documentation to establish qualification for one (1) of the following exemptions: 
(1)  Economic hardship exemption. Exemptions are granted only to the specific owner and use and are not transferable. 
a.  For investment or income-producing properties: The owner's inability to obtain a reasonable rate of return in its present condition or if rehabilitated. 
b.  For non-income-producing properties consisting of owner-occupied single-family dwellings and/or non-income-producing institutional properties not solely operating for profit: The owner's inability to convert the property to institutional use in its present condition or if rehabilitated. 
The consideration for economic hardship shall not include willful or negligent acts by the owner, purchase of the property for substantially more than the market value, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant improvements. 
(2)  Undue hardship. An applicant requesting an exemption based on undue hardship must show that the application of the criteria creates a situation substantially inadequate to meet the applicant's needs because of specific health and/or safety issues. 
(Ord. 480 §11.11, 2003) 
Sec. 16-11-120. - Enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  No person shall violate or permit to be violated any of the requirements of this Article or the terms of a landmark certificate. 
(b)  Violations. Violations of this Article are punishable as is otherwise provided in this Code and, in addition, are subject to the following penalties: 
(1)  Alterations to a designated landmark or district without an approved landmark alteration certificate will result in a one-year moratorium on all building permits for the subject property; and

CHAPTER 18 - Building Regulations 
ARTICLE I - Development Fees 
Division 1 - Capital Improvement Fees[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 759 , § 1, adopted Dec. 2, 2017, repealed the former Div. 1, §§ 18-1-10-18-1-50, and enacted a new Div. 1 as set out herein. The former Div. 1 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 423 §§ 1, 3, 5, adopted 2000; Ord. 443 § 1, adopted 2001; Ord. 467 §§ 1, 3, 5, adopted 2003; Ord. 481 § 1, adopted 2003; Ord. 571 § 2, adopted 2007; Ord. 729 , § 1, adopted May 25, 2016. 

Sec. 18-1-10. - Legislative findings. 
    New residential development imposes increasing demands upon the Town's police, parks and recreation, public works, water and sewer utilities, and related capital facilities; the Town's public facilities, and often overburdens such facilities and systems. The provisions of this Article are intended to impose certain fees to be collected at the time of building permit issuance in an amount calculated as shown herein for the purpose of funding the provisions of additional capital improvements as the Town's population increases. The imposition of said fees on residential and commercial development is intended to regulate the use and development of land by ensuring that new growth and development in the Town bear a proportionate share of the costs of capital expenditures necessary to provide police, fire, public works, and general government facility capital improvements. Said fees shall not be used to collect more than is necessary to fund such capital improvements. The fees provided for in this Article are based on the Impact Fee Study as herein defined and referenced. Funds collected from said fees shall not be used to remedy existing deficiencies, but only to provide new capital improvements which are necessitated by new development. The amount of revenue generated by said fees shall not exceed the cost of providing the capital improvements for which they are imposed, and the same shall be expended solely to provide the specified capital improvements. 
(Ord. 759 , § 1, 12-2-2017) 
Sec. 18-1-20. - Definitions. 
    Commercial development shall mean any development approved by the Town for non-residential commercial, office, and industrial uses. 
    Building permit shall mean the permit required for new construction and additions under Chapter 18 of this Code. 
    Capital improvements shall mean the purchase or long-term lease or lease-purchase of real property, the construction of public facilities or the purchase, long-term lease or lease-purchase of equipment or materials needed to facilitate the operation of such facilities or the delivery of services therefrom, to the extent that such property, improvements, equipment or materials are identified in the Town's capital improvement plan or similar Town planning document as being totally or partially financed by the imposition of impact fees. For the purposes of this provision, long-term lease or lease-purchase shall mean a lease or lease-purchase of not less than five (5) years, subject to annual appropriation. Amounts expended for capital improvements shall include amounts that are treated as capitalized expenses according to generally accepted accounting principles and shall not include costs associated with the operation, administration, maintenance or replacement of capital improvements. 
    Development shall mean any man-made change to improved or unimproved real property. 
    Dwelling shall mean a building used exclusively for residential occupancy, including single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings and multifamily dwellings. The term dwelling shall not include hotels, motels, tents or other structures designed or used primarily for temporary occupancy. 
    Impact fees fund shall mean the separate interest bearing account or fund into which all impact fees received are placed and all related and allowable expenditures are made. The impact fees fund may, but is not required, to be placed in a separate banking account that is separate from the other cash funds of the Town provided that the accounting of such funds clearly identifies the category of capital improvements (e.g., police, fire, etc.) for which such fees were imposed in accordance with C.R.S. Section 29-1-803. 
    Impact Fee Study shall mean the report prepared by BBC Research and Consulting dated September 14, 2017 titled Town of Milliken Development Impact Fees, together with the Technical Appendix referenced therein, as may be amended, copies of which are on file at Milliken Town Hall, 1101 Broad Street, Milliken, Colorado, as herein adopted by reference. 
(Ord. 759 , § 1, 12-2-2017) 
Sec. 18-1-30. - Calculation and payment of impact fees. 
(a)  For each category of capital improvements for which an impact fee is established under the provisions of this Article, the amount of each such impact fee shall be determined on a per dwelling unit and, for commercial development, on a per square foot basis. The Town hereby imposes the impact fees set forth in the Town's comprehensive fee schedule, adopted by resolution of the Board of Trustees pursuant to notice and public hearing. The notice of public hearing to impose or adjust impact fees shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days prior to the date of public hearing. If the request is for a building permit for mixed uses, the Chief Building Official shall determine the fee by apportioning space to each specific use and then applying the applicable fee to each use. If the request is for a building permit for a type of development activity not specified on the fee schedule, the Chief Building Official shall use the fee for the most comparable land use on the fee schedule. 
(b)  The fees required in Section 13-2-330 (cash in lieu of raw water units), this Article, building permit fees, administration fees, applicable taxes, construction meter fees and school fees, shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued, unless deferred at the option of the property owner or property owner's authorized agent subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  An administrative deferral fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) shall be paid at the time the building permit is issued to cover the cost of the Town's administration of the payment deferral. 
(2)  The property owner or the property owner's authorized agent shall pay any associated fees as required by the Town, and the Town, at its sole discretion, may file a lien against the property for the amount of any and all fees deferred. Such lien shall be against the parcel or lot for which fees were deferred and shall have priority over all liens except general taxes and prior special assessments. 
(3)  All fees deferred shall be payable prior to and as a condition precedent to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, or no later than twelve (12) months from the date the building permit is issued, whichever comes first. All deferred fees shall be paid at the then-adopted rates currently in effect at the time the fees are paid. No property or lot shall be conveyed or transferred for which deferred fees have not been paid in full. 
(4)  If the deferred fees are not paid in full at the end of the deferral period as specified in subsection (3) above, no Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued, nor shall the building be occupied or used, and a penalty assessment shall be charged at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum on the unpaid balance retroactive to the date the deferral was granted. Further, the Town may collect the unpaid fees by foreclosing the lien filed pursuant to subsection (2) above, and the lien may be certified by the Finance Director to the Weld County Treasurer to be placed upon the tax list for the current year, to be collected in the same manner as other taxes are collected, with a ten percent (10%) penalty to defray the cost of collection, as provided by state law, C.R.S. § 31-20-105. 
(5)  If the property owner or property owner's authorized agent has previously not timely paid the deferred fees for any property as required by subparagraph 4 above, or allowed a building on any property to be used or occupied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and without paying all deferred fees, such property owner shall be forever barred from deferring fees on any future building permit for any property, regardless of a change of business name or ownership of the property owner or agent. In addition, the Town may withhold building permits to any property owner currently in default under this Section, notwithstanding any lien the Town has filed on a particular property or lot. 
(6)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (5) above, the property owner may authorize, in writing, an agent for the property owner regarding authorization to enter into the deferral of fees permitted by this Section. Any authorized agent of the property owner is subject to all the terms and conditions of this Section. Any authorized agent of the property owner shall only be accepted upon the property owner's written authorization on forms provided by the Town. In any and all events, the property owner remains fully liable to the Town for the payment of all fees and taxes deferred, including, but not limited to penalties and interest, and shall pay the required fee in order to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy and/or to remove the lien from the property.
