PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Whiting, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through Ord. No. 1428, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Donald Gray, City Attorney, Ms. Margaret Drewniak, City Clerk-Treasurer, Honorable Rudy Wunder, Councilperson, and Honorable Bill Ciesar, Jr., Councilperson, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 2-337. - Procedures; regulations. 
(a)  Employees are expected to report to work on time and in appropriate mental and physical condition for work. Employees are not to report to work under the influence of intoxicants, illegal drugs, or illicitly used substances and shall not consume, use, or possess intoxicants, illegal drugs, or illicitly used substances at any time during their scheduled workday, on city property, or in any city vehicle (while traveling to or from city property while on duty). The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance, intoxicant or illicitly used substance on city premises or while conducting city business off premises is absolutely prohibited. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may have legal consequences. 
(b)  If a supervisor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee has reported to work under the influence of intoxicants, illegal drugs, or illicitly used substances, the supervisor, with the approval of the department director, has the right to request that the employee submit to an alcohol or drug screening test at the city's expense. For the purposes of this division, random or routine drug testing shall not be conducted by the city, and testing shall not be conducted in an arbitrary or discriminatory way toward any employee. A supervisor must have reasonable cause for ordering an alcohol or drug screening test and shall document such reasonable cause. The failure of an employee to submit to an alcohol or drug screening test shall be grounds for discipline which may include termination. The results of the alcohol or drug test shall not be used by the city for any purpose other than to determine adherence to city policy, to discipline an employee whenever necessary, and to comply with applicable terms of this division. 
(c)  The city recognizes drug dependency as a major problem. The city also recognizes drug abuse as a potential health, safety and security problem. When it is determined that an employee is suffering from a drug or alcohol abuse problem, reasonable efforts by the city may be made to rehabilitate the employee using available community resources. However, this does not foreclose the right to administer discipline up to and including discharge. Conscientious efforts to seek such help will not jeopardize any employee's job and will not be noted in any personnel record except where action follows a supervisory-initiated referral. The city is committed to assisting employees in this endeavor in any way possible. 
(d)  No employee shall be subject to discipline for the appropriate use of legal nonprescription or prescribed legal drugs for the treatment of illness or injury. However, if the employee knows or should know that use of a nonprescription or prescribed drug does or could impair the employee's ability to operate a city vehicle or equipment, or otherwise perform his job duties, the employee shall share this information with his immediate supervisor. A violation of this section may subject the employee to disciplinary action. 
(e)  Employees must, as a condition of employment, abide by the terms of this division and report any conviction under a criminal drug statute for violations occurring on or off city premises while conducting city business. A report of a conviction must be made within five days after the conviction to the department director. Within ten days of learning of an employee's criminal conviction for illegal drug activity within the workplace, the city will notify the federal government of such conviction. Within 30 days of learning of an employee's criminal conviction for illegal drug activity within the workplace, the city will take appropriate personnel action. (This requirement is mandated by the federally legislated Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988.) 
(f)  A copy of this division shall be provided to each employee.

a.  The loadbearing walls and columns which support the structural loads between the floor and roof systems shall provide such support without bulging or buckling and shall be kept free of critical and major defects. Loadbearing walls shall provide such support without indications of settlement, bulging, or buckling and be maintained in a manner which will protect the surface from deterioration caused by the elements and should prevent the entrance of moisture and cold air into the building; for example, in the foundation, cracks or holes in the wall, rotting of wall members, or leaks which prevent the proper functioning of this component are faults. 
b.  There are two types of loadbearing walls, exterior masonry and exterior frame, each of which has several defects peculiar to it: 
1.  Exterior masonry wall. The same general types of failure and deteriorations as are observed in foundations. In many instances the exterior wall exhibits diagonal cracking in addition to vertical and horizontal cracking. Such cracks generally are not confined to mortar joints themselves but tend to pass through the primary wall material as well as through the lintels over openings in the wall. Lack of watertightness or inadequate ventilation can cause rotting of sills, toeplates, etc. An additional item of deterioration in masonry materials and concrete is the extensive chipping, flaking, crumbling, and erosion of primary exterior wall material. Such deterioration in the exterior wall will lead to deterioration of the core of the wall which may result in failure of the wall if not corrected. 
2.  Exterior frame wall. In wood walls, lack of corner bracing, disposal or ridged sheathing, or firestops, as well as the separation of joints or crushing of the ends of framing members can cause failure of the wall. The entrance of moisture can cause rot which in turn can lead to failure of the wall. For example, rotting of toeplates, sills, studs, bracing, etc. 
3.  Examples of critical and major loadbearing wall defects include: 
i.  Walls which are severely out of plumb. 
ii.  Severe sagging over a large area. 
iii.  Numerous cracks penetrating entire thickness of the wall and extending from floor to ceiling. 
iv.  Failure to support structural loads between floor and roof systems.

(a)  Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Whiting does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Whiting are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(d)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health. 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains. 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.

Sec. 7.5-27. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below: 
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. 
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.) 
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. 
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. 
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood.

    Boundary river floodway means the floodway of a boundary river. 
    Building. See "Structure." 
    Community means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this zone.

(5)  Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations; 
(6)  Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts; 
(7)  Storage of materials; or 
(8)  Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters. 
"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures. 
    Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
    Elevation certificate means a certified statement that verifies a structure's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood prone area means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See "Flood.") 
    Flood protection grade (FPG) means the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See "Freeboard.") 
    Floodplain means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements. 
    Floodproofing (dry floodproofing) means a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    Floodproofing certificate means a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
    Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. 
    Fringe means those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Whiting Common Council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of final determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include letter of map amendment (LOMA), letter of map revision (LOMR), and letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). The definitions are presented below: 
Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA. 
Letter of map revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations. 
Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following: 
(1)  The top of the lowest level of the structure. 
(2)  The top of the basement floor. 
(3)  The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure. 
(4)  The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars. 
(5)  The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless: 
a.  The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls; 
b.  The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and, 
c.  Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance. 
    Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary river. 
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-percent annual chance flood, also known as 100-year flood, is the flood that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent annual chance flood. See "Regulatory flood." 
    Physical map revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
    Regulatory flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in section 7.5-28(b) of this article. The "regulatory flood" is also known by the term "base flood," "one-percent annual chance flood," and "100-year flood." 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City of Whiting are generally identified as such on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.) 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Zone A. See definition for "A zone." 
    Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

Sec. 7.5-28. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Whiting. 
(b)  Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This article's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. 
(1)  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Whiting shall be as delineated on the one-percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated January 18, 2012, and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. 
(2)  The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of Whiting, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Lake County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated January 18, 2012, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved. 
(3)  In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. 
(4)  Upon issuance of a letter of final determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA. 
(c)  Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations. 
(1)  In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern. 
(2)  If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly. 
(3)  If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements. 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body. 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(h)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this article does not create any liability on the part of the City of Whiting, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(i)  Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this article. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for the City of Whiting. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00. 
(1)  A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist. 
(2)  The City of Whiting Plan Commission shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(3)  Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
(Ord. No. CC-2016-1953, art. 3, 2-16-16) 
Sec. 7.5-29. - Administration. 
(a)  Designation of administrator. The Common Council of the City of Whiting hereby appoints the building commissioner to administer and implement the provisions of this article and is herein referred to as the floodplain administrator. 
(b)  Permit procedures. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.

a.  These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood: 
1.  The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
2.  Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in section 7.5-30(b)(4). 
3.  Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings. 
b.  These requirements apply to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood: 
1.  The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
2.  Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in section 7.5-30(b)(4). 
c.  Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either: 
1.  Be on site for less than 180 days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
3.  Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as stated earlier in this section.

(8)  Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above ground gas or liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres. 
(d)  Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(e)  Standards for identified floodways. Located within SFHAs, established in section 7.5-28(b), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.) 
    No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in section 7.5-30 of this article have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence. 
    No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least 0.15 of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses. 
    For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12. 
(f)  Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in section 7.5-30 of this article have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. 
(g)  Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes. 
(1)  Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment. 
No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
Once the floodplain administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in section 7.5-30 of this article have been met. 
(2)  Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile: 
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site. 
Upon receipt, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in section 7.5-30 of this article have been met. 
(3)  The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. 
(h)  Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per section 7.5-30. 
(Ord. No. CC-2016-1953, art. 5, 2-16-16) 
Sec. 7.5-31. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  Designation of variance and appeals board. The City of Whiting Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this article. 
(b)  Duties of variance and appeals board. The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Circuit or Superior Court. 
(c)  Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and; 
(1)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(3)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(4)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development, 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(9)  The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site. 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(d)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship. 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
(2)  No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to section 7.5-30(e) or (g)(1) of this article may be granted. 
(3)  Any variance granted in a floodway subject to section 7.5-30(e) or (g)(1) of this article will require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. 
(4)  Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of section 7.5-30(b), may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(6)  Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures. 
(7)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (see section 7.5-31(e)). 
(8)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see section 7.5-31(e)). 
(e)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and; 
(2)  Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and property. 
    The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
(f)  Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(g)  Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors listed in section 7.5-31, and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Sec. 9-27. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the people within the city by enacting a housing code which establishes for all buildings used for housing: 
(1)  Minimum standards for cooking, heating, and sanitary equipment necessary and expedient to promote health, suppress disease and protect the safety of occupants of such buildings. 
(2)  Facilities for ventilation, light, space and means of egress which promote health and preserve safety. 
(3)  Minimum standards of maintenance and responsibilities of owners, agents, and occupants of dwellings for such maintenance which promote health and safety and aid in the enforcement of such standards. 
(4)  Minimum standards essential to health, safety and welfare which are uniform in application to all dwellings whenever constructed so that with the resulting uniformity, simplicity and certainty, owners, operators and tenants are better able to determine the applicability of the law to them and the laws applicable to housing are administratively more convenient to enforce. 
(Code 1962, § 11-102; Code 1979, § 15.08.010)

    This article is applicable to occupancy for residential purposes of any building, whether or not such building was erected, moved, altered or converted in full or substantial compliance with ordinances in force at the time of its erection, relocation, alteration or conversion, and whether or not such building was erected, moved, altered, or converted prior to the effective date of this article. Whenever any such ordinance imposes higher standards of health and safety than the standards imposed by this article, this article does not make a continued violation of such ordinance legal, nor does this article permit any building which complies with such ordinances to be altered or converted, as to either structure or occupancy, to conform to any lower standards imposed by this article. Every building constructed, altered or converted after the effective date of this article shall comply with the applicable provisions of the building provisions of the building code in effect at such time, and such a building shall not be occupied for residential purposes unless it complies also with any higher standards imposed by this article. The requirements imposed by this article shall be in addition to other applicable requirements for existing buildings imposed by other provisions and applicable requirements regarding garbage and trash, nuisances, and air pollution provisions of this Code.

Sec. 9-29. - Inspections. 
    In addition to the powers and duties granted the building commissioner, the electrical inspector, the plumbing inspector, the city health officer, and the fire inspector under the building code of Whiting, Indiana, it shall be the duty of the aforementioned inspectors to report to the building commissioner all violations of the standards as prescribed in this article that are observed by them in the course of their duties as inspectors as prescribed by this Code.

(5)  Contain an outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Hearing. Any person affected by any such notice issued by the building commissioner may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the board of public works and safety. If such notice is issued due to violations that have been reported by inspectors other than those working under the supervision of the building commissioner, then a representative of the department employing the reporting inspector shall be in attendance at the hearing; provided, that such person shall file in the office of the building commissioner within ten days after service of the notice, a written petition requesting such hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor. Upon receipt of such petition, the building commissioner shall arrange a time and place for such hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. Such a hearing shall be held as soon as practicable after the receipt of request therefor.

(f)  Nonreceipt of notice. Failure on the part of any owner or party in interest to receive or have served upon him any complaint, notice, or other order provided for in this article shall not affect or invalidate the proceedings with respect to any other owner or party in interest or any other person. 
(g)  Emergencies. Whenever the city health officer finds that an emergency exists which requires immediate action to protect the public health, he may, without notice or hearing, issue an order citing the existence of such an emergency and requiring that such action be taken as he deems necessary to meet the emergency and so inform the building commissioner. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, such order shall be effected immediately. Any person to whom such an order is directed shall comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the director of public health shall be given a hearing as soon as possible in the manner provided in subsection (b). After such hearing, depending upon the finding as to whether the provisions of this article have been complied with, the board shall continue such order or modify or revoke it.

Editor's note- Ord. No. CC-2013-1904, § 1, adopted Dec. 17, 2013, effective Jan. 1, 2014, repealed the former § 16-168 and enacted a new § 16-168 as set out herein. The former section pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. CC-2005-1737, 12-6-05; Ord. No. CC-2003-1659, 12-16-03; Ord. No. CC-2000-1599, 9-19-00. For prior derivations see the Code Comparative Table. 
Sec. 16-169. - Quantities of water discharged or used; methods of determination. 
    The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by the district in such manner as the district shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service shall be billed at the appropriate rates established in section 16-168; further, as is hereinafter provided in this section, the district may make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed, but which quantities are also shown to the satisfaction of the district not to enter the sanitary sewage system. 
(1)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the district's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the district, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the district. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this division, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the district for the determination of sewage discharge. If there is no meter or any adequate and approved method of measurement for residential lots or residential parcels of real estate, then the service charge for such sewage service shall be $1.80 per month or $5.40 per quarter. 
(2)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the district's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city and, in addition, is a user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the district, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the district. In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall, at their expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the district for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(3)  In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, buildings or dwelling units discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into the district's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then, in such case, for billing purposes, the sewage rates and charges shall be based either on the quantity of water used on the property or premises subject to such rates and charges, as the same is measured by the single water meter there in use and shown by consumption records of the water utility, or on the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, buildings or dwelling units served through the single water meter times $5.40 per quarter, whichever is greater. In the case of trailer parks, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of trailers located and installed in the park plus any other dwelling units served through the meter. 
(4)  In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the district's sanitary sewerage either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the district that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the district for the determination of sewage discharge. 
(5)  In order that the single-family domestic and residential user of sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the summer quarters, the billing for sewage service for residential and/or domestic users for such months shall be based upon the water usage of the preceding winter quarter as follows: 
Summer Quarter 
 Usage Months     Winter Quarter 
    Usage Months May, June and July November, December and January June, July and August December, January and February July, August and September January, February and March  
In the event the water usage for such winter quarter is greater than the water usage for such summer quarter, then the billing for the sewage service shall be computed on the actual water used in the quarter for which the sewage service is being rendered. Domestic and/or residential sewage service, as applicable to the sprinkling rate, shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate or building which is occupied and used as a single-family residence. The sprinkling rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises is used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water served through a separate meter and in such case the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate. The sprinkling rate shall not become effective until such time that the board of sanitary commissioners with approval of the common council is assured that there is sufficient revenue generated by the user charge system to meet the annual operating and maintenance, including replacement, expenses of the sewage works based upon at least four months of actual operating experience.

(a)  In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the district shall base its charges not only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The district shall require the industrial user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method as the district may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The industrial user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the district at all times. 
(b)  Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a biochemical oxygen demand of 220 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended solids in excess of 260 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis: 
(1)  Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an additional charge of $1.763 per 100 pounds for suspended solids received in excess of 260 milligrams per liter of fluid. 
(2)  Rate surcharge based upon BOD. There shall be an additional charge of $4.002 per 100 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid. 
(c)  The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of Standard Methods for Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association, the Water Environment Federation, and in conformance with Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants, regulation 40 CFR 136, published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.

(2)  The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to examine the collection records of the district for the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided, that such examination shall be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business. 
(3)  As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when due are declared to be delinquent and a penalty of ten percent of the rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto. The time at which such rates or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 30 days after the date of mailing of the bill.

Sec. 16-172. - Annual studies made to determine fairness and equity rates and charges. 
(a)  In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users of user classes, the district shall cause a study to be made within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months of operation, following the date on which the ordinance codified in this division goes into effect. Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance and replacements to the sewerage system. 
(b)  Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of time following the normal accounting period, the district shall cause a similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis. Such studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the district or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public accountant, or engineers as the district shall determine to be best under the circumstances.

a.  Public Provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or other provision of law, except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, the provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control. It shall be the developer's or applicant's responsibility to determine and comply with all other applicable City, state, or federal codes or regulations governing development and land use activities. 
b.  Private Provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. Where the provisions of the easement impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or standards that are higher than the requirements of these regulations or the determinations of the Plan Commission in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and the private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or the determinations made under these regulations, then the private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and the determinations made under the regulations. In no case shall the City be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements or agreements between parties. 
2.7. - Conflict. 
    If for any reason these provisions come in conflict with any other regulations, the more restrictive regulation will apply. 
2.8. - Severability. 
    Should any section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, clause, word, or provision of this Ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
2.9. - Saving Provision. 
    These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful action of the City except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations. 
2.10. - Effective Date. 
    This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its approval by the Common Council of the City of Whiting, Indiana, hereafter referred to as the City Council.

3.0. - ZONING MAP AND DISTRICTS 

3.1. - Establishment of Zoning Map. 
    The Zoning Map adopted with this Ordinance is hereby established as the official Zoning Map and Zoning Districts of the City of Whiting, Indiana. Said map designates the respective zoning districts in accordance with this Ordinance. 
a.  Zoning Map Included. The Zoning Map is specifically identified as part of this Ordinance. 
b.  Determination and Interpretation of District Boundaries. In determining the boundaries of districts, and establishing the provisions applicable to each district, due and careful consideration has been given to existing conditions, the character of buildings erected in each district, the most desirable use for which the land in each district may be adapted, and the conservation of property values throughout the areas of the City under the Plan Commission's jurisdiction. 
(1)  Where uncertainty exists as to the exact boundaries of any district as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply: 
i.  In un-subdivided areas, or where a district boundary line passes though a lot, the exact location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale of the official plat maps prepared by the Lake County Auditor. 
ii.  In the case of further uncertainty, the Plan Commission shall interpret the intent of the Zoning Map as to the location of the boundary in question. 
c.  Procedure Relating to Vacated Areas. Whenever any street, place, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by proper authority, the districts adjoining each side of such street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way, or similar area shall be extended automatically to the center of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall then be subject to all appropriate provisions of the extended districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining district, or district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all of the vacated area. 
d.  Zoning of Streets, Alleys, Public Ways, and Railroad Rights-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same use district as the property immediately abutting upon these alleys, streets, public ways, and railroad rights-of-way. If the center line of a street is a boundary, the zoning of those areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to that center line. 
3.2. - Establishment of Districts and Overlays. 
    Land use and geographic features in the City were examined and classified into zoning districts. These districts are defined on the Zoning Map. The Zoning Map shall be kept and maintained by the Zoning Administrator and shall be available for inspection by the public. Figure A: Zoning Districts shows the following districts hereby established:

3.3. - Authorized Uses and Requirements. 
a.  Intent of general use tables. The intent of the use table for each of the districts in this chapter is to give a general idea of the types of uses permitted and prohibited for each district. 
(1)  This list is not meant to be comprehensive or exhaustive. 
(2)  Figure 1: Land Use District Table shows the Allowed/Permitted Use by Right, and Special Exception uses within each Zoning District. 
(3)  The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to decide if the use classification is appropriate for any proposed use. 
i.  The Zoning Administrator may reassign a more appropriate use classification to the project that more appropriately reflects what the project wishes to achieve. 
ii.  The Zoning Administrator may use the 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to determine a more appropriate use classification.

(1)  All plant materials must be kept in a healthy condition. No artificial plants shall be considered toward minimum landscaping requirements. Dead plants must be removed and replaced as necessary. 
(2)  All portions of the site where existing vegetative cover is damaged or removed, that are not otherwise covered with new improvements, shall be successfully re-vegetated with a mix of native, adaptive, and drought tolerant grasses and ground covers. The density of the reestablished vegetation must be adequate to prevent soil erosion and invasion of weeds after one growing season. 
(3)  All plant materials shall be installed in the best possible manner to ensure their continued viability. Shrub and flower beds must be lined with a weed barrier mesh (or similar material designed for weed control) to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds. 
(4)  All required landscaping must be located on the property it serves. 
(5)  All required landscaping must be located outside of any adjacent right-of-way unless otherwise stated by the Zoning Administrator. 
(6)  Landscaping shall be used to screen from view uses such as trash enclosures, storage areas, mechanical equipment, loading docks, and similar items where such areas are visible from roads, sidewalks, or open space. 
(7)  Non-living ground cover may include decorative gravel, bark mulch, river rock, or similar materials. Decorative elements, such as walks, decks, terraces, water features and similar features may be included. Planting beds may not contain more than fifty percent (50%) non-living ground cover. 
(8)  All plants used for landscaping shall be compatible with the local climate and the soils, drainage, and water conditions of the site. When planting occurs on hillsides, slopes, drainage ways, or similar natural areas, plant material should duplicate adjacent plant communities both in species composition and special distribution patterns. Whenever possible, drought-resistant varieties of plant materials shall be utilized. 
(9)  Healthy trees, native vegetation, and natural or significant rock outcroppings and other valuable features shall be preserved and integrated within planting areas. Existing healthy trees and shrubs that are preserved shall count toward the landscaping standards of this section. 
(10)  To ensure healthy plant materials are installed in new development, trees and shrubs shall comply with the following standards. 
i.  Deciduous Trees. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches (2?) in caliper measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
ii.  Coniferous Trees. Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height, measured from the top of the root ball to the top of the tree. 
iii.  Ornamental Trees. Ornamental trees shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) inches in caliper, measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
iv.  Shrubs and Vines. Shrubs shall be a minimum of one (1) foot in height at time of planting. Vines shall be in a minimum one (1) gallon container. 
(11)  Clear vision areas shall be designated in compliance with applicable requirements of the Indiana Department of Transportation and as otherwise deemed necessary for public health and safety. Plant materials shall be limited to thirty (30) inches in height within the clear vision area to avoid visibility obstructions or blind corners at intersections. 
(12)  Landscaping shall not obstruct fire hydrants or utility boxes and shall be installed so it will not grow into any overhead utility lines. Trees and shrubs shall not be planted within four (4) feet of existing overhead or underground lines. 
3.6-13. - Environmental Standards. 
a.  No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for such use or structure due to slopes greater than ten (10) percent, adverse soil or rock formation, erosion susceptibility, low percolation rate or bearing strength, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the community. In addition, the following standards must be met: 
(1)  Surface Water. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot or parcel of land developed for any use to provide for adequate surface water drainage. When possible, existing natural surface drainage may be utilized. Whenever the evidence available indicates that the natural surface drainage is inadequate, the owner shall provide the parcel with an adequate surface water system which shall be integrated into the drainage pattern of surrounding properties. When the surface drainage is adequate, an easement for such surface drainage shall be provided. On-site detention shall be required where necessary to prevent harm to adjoining properties. 
(2)  Drainage. Drainage swales (ditches) along dedicated roadways and within the right-of-way or on dedicated drainage easements are not to be altered, except for maintenance as originally constructed and as approved by the County Highway Department, the Lake County Drainage Board, City Street Department, or Indiana Department of Transportation.

The final inspection of the landscaping shall be performed at a reasonable, later date as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
3.7-12. - Landscaping. 
    This section provides minimum standards for all landscaping required by this Ordinance. 
a.  Basic Standards. This section shall apply to new property development and any expansion of existing legally conforming sites or structures that exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the existing site or structure, except for single-family dwelling structures. 
(1)  All plant materials must be kept in a healthy condition. No artificial plants shall be considered toward minimum landscaping requirements. Dead plants must be removed and replaced as necessary. 
(2)  All portions of the site where existing vegetative cover is damaged or removed, that are not otherwise covered with new improvements, shall be successfully re-vegetated with a mix of native, adaptive and drought-tolerant grasses and ground covers. The density of the reestablished vegetation must be adequate to prevent soil erosion and invasion of weeds after one growing season. 
(3)  All plant materials shall be installed in the best possible manner to ensure their continued viability. Shrub and flower beds must be lined with a weed barrier mesh (or similar material designed for weed control) to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds. 
(4)  All required landscaping must be located on the property it serves. 
(5)  All required landscaping must be located outside of any adjacent right-of-way unless otherwise stated by the Zoning Administrator. 
(6)  Landscaping shall be used to screen from view uses such as trash enclosures, storage areas, mechanical equipment, loading docks, and similar items where such areas are visible from roads, sidewalks, or open space. 
(7)  Non-living ground cover may include decorative gravel, bark mulch, river rock, or similar materials. Decorative elements, such as walks, decks, terraces, water features and similar features may be included. Planting beds may not contain more than fifty percent (50%) non-living ground cover. 
(8)  All plants used for landscaping shall be compatible with the local climate and the soils, drainage, and water conditions of the site. When planting occurs on hillsides, slopes, drainage ways or similar natural areas, plant material should duplicate adjacent plant communities both in species composition and special distribution patterns. Whenever possible, drought-resistant varieties of plant materials shall be utilized. 
(9)  Healthy trees, native vegetation, and natural or significant rock outcroppings and other valuable features shall be preserved and integrated within planting areas. Existing healthy trees and shrubs that are preserved shall count towards the landscaping standards of this section. 
(10)  To ensure healthy plant materials are installed in new development, trees and shrubs shall comply with the following standards. 
i.  Deciduous Trees. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches (2?) in caliper measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
ii.  Coniferous Trees. Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height, measured from the top of the root ball to the top of the tree. 
iii.  Ornamental Trees. Ornamental trees shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) inches in caliper, measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
iv.  Shrubs and Vines. Shrubs shall be a minimum of one (1) foot in height at time of planting. Vines shall be in a minimum one (1) gallon container. 
(11)  Clear vision areas shall be designated in compliance with applicable requirements of the Indiana Department of Transportation, and as otherwise deemed necessary for public health and safety. Plant materials shall be limited to thirty (30) inches in height within the clear vision area to avoid visibility obstructions or blind corners at intersections. 
(12)  Landscaping shall not obstruct fire hydrants or utility boxes and shall be installed so it will not grow into any overhead utility lines. Trees and shrubs shall not be planted within four (4) feet of existing overhead or underground lines. 
3.7-13. - Environmental Standards. 
    No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for such use or structure due to slopes greater than ten (10) percent, adverse soil or rock formation, erosion susceptibility, low percolation rate or bearing strength, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the community. In addition, the following standards must be met: 
a.  Surface Water. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot or parcel of land developed for any use to provide for adequate surface water drainage. When possible, existing natural surface drainage may be utilized. Whenever the evidence available indicates that the natural surface drainage is inadequate, the owner shall provide the parcel with an adequate surface water system that shall be integrated into the drainage pattern of surrounding properties. When the surface drainage is adequate, an easement for such surface drainage shall be provided. On-site detention shall be required where necessary to prevent harm to adjoining properties. 
b.  Drainage. Drainage swales (ditches) along dedicated roadways and within the right-of-way or on dedicated drainage easements are not to be altered, except for maintenance as originally constructed and as approved by the County Highway Department, the Lake County Drainage Board, City Street Department, or Indiana Department of Transportation. Driveways may be constructed over these or other approved structures as permitted by the appropriate agency. 
c.  Permanent Structures. No permanent structures other than a fence may be erected, and if erected in violation of this section, no such structure may be used if the location is within seventy-five (75) feet of the centerline of any legal tile ditch, or within seventy-five (75) feet of the existing top edge of any legal open ditch or tile unless approved by the Lake County Drainage Board and the Whiting Plan Commission. 
d.  Preservation of Natural/Historic Features. Existing natural and historic features that would add value to development of natural or manmade assets of the city, such as trees, streams, vistas, lakes, historical landmarks, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved through harmonious and careful design. Land to be developed shall be designed and improved as far as practical in conformity to existing topography in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and conserve the natural cover and soil. 
e.  Cut/Fill Grade. No cut or fill grade shall exceed a slope of 3:1 or thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3 %). This provision shall apply to all cuts and fills exceeding one hundred (100) square feet in exposed surface area, including cuts or fills on land naturally exceeding 3:1 in slope. 
f.  Erosion Prevention. All land, regardless of slope, from which structures or natural cover has been removed or otherwise destroyed, shall be appropriately graded and seeded within a reasonable time of such activity to prevent erosion. 
g.  Alterations to Shoreline. No alteration of the shoreline or bed of a river or public lake shall be made until written approval is obtained from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions of this Ordinance are complied with. Alterations include, among other things, filling of a river or wetlands, dredging of a riverbed, and ditch excavation within one-half (1/2) mile of a water body. 
h.  Hazardous Waste. All development must be in compliance with IC Title 7, as amended, as it relates to hazardous waste, low level nuclear waste, underground storage tanks, waste tires, and other applicable ordinances of said Title. 
i.  Environmental Quality. All development must be in compliance with IC Title 13, as amended, as it relates to air pollution control, water pollution control, solid waste management, and other applicable ordinances of said Title. 
j.  Waste Disposal. No waste materials, such as garbage, rubbish, gasoline, oil, flammables, soils, tars, chemicals, greases, industrial or agricultural waste, or any other material of such nature, quantity, obnoxiousness, toxicity, or temperature so as to contaminate, pollute, or harm the waters shall be deposited, located, stored, or discharged on any lot in a way that would be likely to run off, seep, or wash into surface or groundwaters. 
k.  Fuel Storage. No highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or gases specified by the State Fire Marshal shall be stored in bulk above ground, except tanks or drums of fuel connected directly with energy devices or heating appliances located and operated on the same lot as the tanks or drums of fuel except for permitted uses in an I-HIM-SZ District. 
l.  Debris/Refuse. Debris and refuse shall not accumulate on any property, in any zoning district. 
m.  Treatment of Fill. Bricks, concrete, lumber, and other material used for fill where permitted by this Ordinance and/or by the IDEM, DNR, or other governmental agency, shall be promptly covered and seeded. 
n.  View Requirements. Where a proposed structure will eliminate more than fifty percent of an adjacent structure's view or exposure to the sun, an additional yard area setback may be required by the Zoning Administrator so that the fifty percent (50%) view or exposure may be maintained. 
o.  Health and Safety. No use shall be permitted that is injurious in health and safety of humans, animals, or vegetation, or that is noxious by reason of the emission of odor, visual pollution, or other undesirable nuisances that effects extend beyond the lot line where the use exists. 
3.7-14. - Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities. 
    All sidewalks shall follow the standards set forth in WMC Chapter 15: Article III Sidewalks ordinance. The following may be required in addition to the Sidewalk Ordinance. 
a.  Sidewalks may be placed within required setbacks. 
b.  Sidewalks must meet and connect with sidewalks on adjoining properties. The Zoning Administrator can, and may require changes to sidewalk placement to meet this requirement.

However, if seasonal circumstances do not permit the planting of the required landscaping, the developer may post a bond in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the installed landscape cost, and may delay installation up to six (6) months. The final inspection of the landscaping shall be performed at a reasonable, later date as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
3.8-13. - Landscaping. 
    This section provides minimum standards for all landscaping required by this Ordinance. 
a.  Basic Standards. This section shall apply to new property development and any expansion of existing legally conforming sites or structures that exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the existing site or structure, except for single family dwelling structures. 
(1)  All plant materials must be kept in a healthy condition. No artificial plants shall be considered toward minimum landscaping requirements. Dead plants must be removed and replaced as necessary. 
(2)  All portions of the site where existing vegetative cover is damaged or removed, that are not otherwise covered with new improvements, shall be successfully re-vegetated with a mix of native, adaptive and drought tolerant grasses and ground covers. The density of the reestablished vegetation must be adequate to prevent soil erosion and invasion of weeds after one growing season. 
(3)  All plant materials shall be installed in the best possible manner to ensure their continued viability. Shrub and flower beds must be lined with a weed barrier mesh (or similar material designed for weed control) to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds. 
(4)  All required landscaping must be located on the property it serves.

(3)  For uses not specified in this section or in the instance requirements for an adequate number of spaces is unclear, the number of spaces shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator on the basis of similar requirements, the number of persons served or employed and the capability of adequately serving the visiting public. Such determination may be reviewed by the Plan Commission or appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(4)  Unless noted in accordance with this section, the number of required automobile parking spaces shall be considered the minimum allowable number of spaces for any particular use. 
(5)  Any particular use shall not have more than ten percent (10%) more parking spaces than the required minimum amount required for that specific use. 
e.  Joint Use. Mixed uses, within the same and/or separate structures, may provide joint parking provided the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of requirements for the various uses. To the extent that developments with joint parking operate at different times, such parking spaces may be credited to both uses. The Zoning Administrator may require proof of an executed shared parking agreement. 
f.  Residential Parking for Mixed-Use Development. The requirements set forth within this section shall apply to mixed-use developments with residential uses, or high-density residential development within the C-BB-SZ District. 
(1)  On-street parking spaces located along the portion of a public street(s) abutting the use may be counted toward the minimum number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance. Those on-street parking spaces must be located on the same side(s) of the street as the use. In the event that any on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum requirement is removed by the City, the existing use will not be required to make up the difference. 
(2)  The parking requirements (for new spaces) of the district may be met onsite or offsite at a distance of up to three hundred (300) feet from the permitted use. 
g.  Satellite Parking. Parking shall be required on site, except as provided in this section; however, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant satellite parking to any mixed-use by Special Exception.

(1)  All off-street parking areas containing fifteen (15) or more spaces shall be separated from all public or private street rights-of-way by a landscape screen that is a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width. Parking areas adjacent to other developed parcels shall require a planting area that is a minimum ten (10) feet in width. Landscape buffers may be achieved through the use of earthen berms, shrubs, trees or other appropriate materials to effectively screen the parking area from the rights-of-way. 
(2)  Interior Parking Areas. Planting shall be established to break up the interior of all parking areas. Landscape planting islands shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width to ensure adequate room for planting. Interior landscaping shall be comprised of one (1) canopy tree and three (3) shrubs for every fifteen (15) parking spaces. 
(3)  Lighting. Lighting provided to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be so arranged, shielded and directed upon the parking area in such a manner as to not reflect or cause glare into adjacent properties or interfere with street traffic. Lighting shall be in accordance with the Lighting standards listed above. 
(4)  Inspections. At the time the structure receives its final inspection, the completion of the landscaping in accordance with these requirements shall also be a part of the final inspection. However, if seasonal circumstances do not permit the planting of the required landscaping, the developer may post a bond in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the installed landscape cost, and may delay installation up to six (6) months. The final inspection of the landscaping shall be performed at a reasonable, later date as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
3.9-13. - Landscaping. 
    This section provides minimum standards for all landscaping required by this Ordinance. 
a.  Basic Standards. This section shall apply to new property development and any expansion of existing legally conforming sites or structures that exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the existing site or structure, except for single-family dwelling structures. 
(1)  All plant materials must be kept in a healthy condition. No artificial plants shall be considered toward minimum landscaping requirements. Dead plants must be removed and replaced as necessary. 
(2)  All portions of the site where existing vegetative cover is damaged or removed, that are not otherwise covered with new improvements, shall be successfully re-vegetated with a mix of native, adaptive, and drought-tolerant grasses and ground covers. The density of the reestablished vegetation must be adequate to prevent soil erosion and invasion of weeds after one growing season. 
(3)  All plant materials shall be installed in the best possible manner to ensure their continued viability. Shrub and flower beds must be lined with a weed barrier mesh (or similar material designed for weed control) to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds. 
(4)  All required landscaping must be located on the property it serves. 
(5)  All required landscaping must be located outside of any adjacent right-of-way unless otherwise stated by the Zoning Administrator. 
(6)  Landscaping shall be used to screen from view uses, such as trash enclosures, storage areas, mechanical equipment, loading docks, and similar items where such areas are visible from roads, sidewalks, or open space. 
(7)  Non-living ground cover may include decorative gravel, bark mulch, river rock or similar materials. Decorative elements, such as walks, decks, terraces, water features, and similar features may be included. Planting beds may not contain more than fifty percent (50%) non-living ground cover. 
(8)  All plants used for landscaping shall be compatible with the local climate and the soils, drainage, and water conditions of the site. When planting occurs on hillsides, slopes, drainage ways, or similar natural areas, plant material should duplicate adjacent plant communities both in species composition and special distribution patterns. Whenever possible, drought-resistant varieties of plant materials shall be utilized. 
(9)  Healthy trees, native vegetation, and natural or significant rock outcroppings and other valuable features shall be preserved and integrated within planting areas. Existing healthy trees and shrubs that are preserved shall count towards the landscaping standards of this Section. 
(10)  To ensure healthy plant materials are installed in new development, trees and shrubs shall comply with the following standards. 
i.  Deciduous Trees. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches (2?) in caliper measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
ii.  Coniferous Trees. Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height, measured from the top of the root ball to the top of the tree. 
iii.  Ornamental Trees. Ornamental trees shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) inches in caliper, measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
iv.  Shrubs and Vines. Shrubs shall be a minimum of one (1) foot in height at time of planting. Vines shall be in a minimum one (1) gallon container. 
(11)  Clear vision areas shall be designated in compliance with applicable requirements of the Indiana Department of Transportation, and as otherwise deemed necessary for public health and safety. Plant materials shall be limited to thirty (30) inches in height within the clear vision area to avoid visibility obstructions or blind corners at intersections. 
(12)  Landscaping shall not obstruct fire hydrants or utility boxes and shall be installed so it will not grow into any overhead utility lines. Trees and shrubs shall not be planted within four (4) feet of existing overhead or underground lines. 
3.9-14. - Environmental Standards. 
    No land shall be used or structure erected where the land is unsuitable for such use or structure due to slopes greater than ten (10) percent, adverse soil or rock formation, erosion susceptibility, low percolation rate or bearing strength, or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics, and general welfare of the community. In addition, the following standards must be met: 
a.  Surface Water. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any lot or parcel of land developed for any use to provide for adequate surface water drainage. When possible, existing natural surface drainage may be utilized. Whenever the evidence available indicates that the natural surface drainage is inadequate, the owner shall provide the parcel with an adequate surface water system which shall be integrated into the drainage pattern of surrounding properties. When the surface drainage is adequate, an easement for such surface drainage shall be provided. On-site detention shall be required where necessary to prevent harm to adjoining properties. 
b.  Drainage. Drainage swales (ditches) along dedicated roadways and within the right-of-way or on dedicated drainage easements are not to be altered, except for maintenance as originally constructed and as approved by the County Highway Department, the Lake County Drainage Board, City Street Department, or Indiana Department of Transportation. Driveways may be constructed over these or other approved structures as permitted by the appropriate agency. 
c.  Permanent Structures. No permanent structures other than a fence may be erected, and if erected in violation of this section, no such structure may be used if the location is within seventy-five (75) feet of the centerline of any legal tile ditch, or within seventy-five (75) feet of the existing top edge of any legal open ditch or tile unless approved by the Lake County Drainage Board and the Whiting Plan Commission. 
d.  Preservation of Natural/Historic Features. Existing natural and historic features that would add value to development of natural or manmade assets of the city, such as trees, streams, vistas, lakes, historical landmarks, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved through harmonious and careful design. Land to be developed shall be designed and improved as far as practical in conformity to existing topography in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and conserve the natural cover and soil. 
e.  Cut/Fill Grade. No cut or fill grade shall exceed a slope of 3:1 or thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3 %). This provision shall apply to all cuts and fills exceeding one hundred (100) square feet in exposed surface area, including cuts or fills on land naturally exceeding 3:1 in slope. 
f.  Erosion Prevention. All land, regardless of slope, from which structures or natural cover has been removed or otherwise destroyed, shall be appropriately graded and seeded within a reasonable time of such activity to prevent erosion. 
g.  Alterations to Shoreline. No alteration of the shoreline or bed of a river or public lake shall be made until written approval is obtained from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions of this Ordinance are complied with. Alterations include, among other things, filling of a river or wetlands, dredging of a riverbed, and ditch excavation within one-half (1/2) mile of a water body. 
h.  Hazardous Waste. All development must be in compliance with IC Title 7, as amended, as it relates to hazardous waste, low level nuclear waste, underground storage tanks, waste tires, and other applicable ordinances of said Title. 
i.  Environmental Quality. All development must be in compliance with IC Title 13, as amended, as it relates to air pollution control, water pollution control, solid waste management, and other applicable ordinances of said Title. 
j.  Waste Disposal. No waste materials such as garbage, rubbish, gasoline, oil, flammables, soils, tars, chemicals, greases, industrial or agricultural waste, or any other material of such nature, quantity, obnoxiousness, toxicity, or temperature so as to contaminate, pollute, or harm the waters shall be deposited, located, stored, or discharged on any lot in a way that would be likely to run off, seep, or wash into surface or groundwaters. 
k.  Fuel Storage. No highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or gases specified by the State Fire Marshal shall be stored in bulk above ground, except tanks or drums of fuel connected directly with energy devices or heating appliances located and operated on the same lot as the tanks or drums of fuel except for permitted uses in I-HIM-SZ District. 
l.  Debris/Refuse. Debris and refuse shall not accumulate on any property, in any zoning district. 
m.  Treatment of Fill. Bricks, concrete, lumber, and other material used for fill where permitted by this Ordinance and/or by the IDEM, DNR, or other governmental agency, shall be promptly covered and seeded. 
n.  View Requirements. Where a proposed structure will eliminate more than fifty percent of an adjacent structure's view or exposure to the sun, an additional yard area setback may be required by the Zoning Administrator so that the fifty percent (50%) view or exposure may be maintained. 
o.  Health and Safety. No use shall be permitted that is injurious in health and safety of humans, animals, or vegetation, or that is noxious by reason of the emission of odor, visual pollution, or other undesirable nuisances that effects extend beyond the lot line where the use exists. 
3.9-15. - Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities. 
    All sidewalks shall follow the standards set forth in WMC Chapter 15: Streets, Sidewalks and other Public Places. The following may be required in addition to the Sidewalk Ordinance. 
a.  Sidewalks may be placed within required setbacks. 
b.  Sidewalks must meet and connect with sidewalks on adjoining properties. The Zoning Administrator can, and may require changes to sidewalk placement to meet this requirement. 
c.  Sidewalks shall remain the property of the property owner, who shall be responsible for maintenance and upkeep of sidewalks at all times. 
d.  Sidewalks shall be maintained at all times to meet accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
e.  Sidewalks shall have a maximum slope of five percent (5%), be a minimum of five (5) feet wide with a four (4) inch surface thickness and six (6) inch compacted aggregate base. 
f.  Sidewalks shall be maintained at all times to be passable. This includes: 
(1)  Removal of snow and other debris. 
(2)  Repair or replacement due to major cracks or other damage.

All parking or loading areas shall be designed with appropriate means of movement and shall be so arranged that movement can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles. No parking area shall be so designed as to require backing into a public street, public or private pedestrian access way, or from a public alley. 
(2)  All parking or loading spaces shall be designed, arranged, and regulated as to open directly upon an aisle or driveway without obstruction. 
(3)  All parking areas shall be striped and channelized as appropriate. Parking spaces shall be marked and access lines clearly defined, including directional arrows to guide internal movement and directional signs as necessary. 
(4)  All parking or loading areas shall be maintained in good condition and free of weeds, dirt, trash, and debris. 
(5)  Parking spaces shall be provided with bumper guards or wheel stops along the perimeter of the parking area so located that no part of a parked vehicle will extend beyond the boundary of the parking area. 
(6)  No more than fifteen (15) parking spaces shall be permitted in a continuous row. 
(7)  All parking lots must be paved with a hard surface, such as asphalt, concrete, or pervious pavers. 
(8)  All parking areas consisting of more than sixty (60) spaces shall provide separate pedestrian walkways. Such walkways should generally be oriented perpendicular to and between parking bays. 
i.  One walkway can serve as a collector for up to four (4) rows of parking spaces. 
ii.  The walkway should be a minimum of four (4) feet wide, allowing an additional thirty (30) inches on each side for overhanging of vehicles. 
iii.  All walkways should be constructed to be clearly defined through the use of material, landscaping or other form of delineation. 
(9)  Any use that fronts upon and utilizes access to a primary or secondary arterial shall provide and utilize a common frontage or access lane for the purpose of access, parking, and loading. 
(10)  Required parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in a structure. Parking structures shall be treated as any major structure and shall be subject to all applicable structural requirements of this Ordinance. 
(11)  Parking structures shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with their surroundings, including appearance, size, scale, building materials, and bulk. 
(12)  All parking areas shall conform to state and federal requirements regarding accessibility. 
i.  Entrances/Driveways. 
(1)  Entrances and driveways must be spaced away from intersections for vehicular and pedestrian safety and to reduce traffic congestion. Spacing should be as follows in the table below: 
Figure AA: I-HIM-SZ Road Widths Road Class/District REC/REC LAKE R-SF R-MD R-HD C-DB C-BB INST I-LIM I-HIM Primary Arterial 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 60 ft. 70 ft. 80 ft. Secondary Arterial 50 ft. 50 ft. 50 ft. 50 ft. 50 ft. 50 ft. 50 ft. 60 ft. 70 ft. Collector (Feeder) 40 ft. 40 ft. 40 ft. 40 ft. 40 ft. 40 ft. 40 ft. 50 ft. 60 ft. Local Street 30 ft. 30 ft. 30 ft. 30 ft. 30 ft. 30 ft. 30 ft. 40 ft. 50 ft.  
(2)  Driveway width shall be a minimum of thirty-four (34) feet for uses in the I-HIM-SZ District. 
j.  Landscaping within Off-Street Parking Areas. 
(1)  All off-street parking areas containing fifteen (15) or more spaces shall be separated from all public or private street rights-of-way by a landscape screen that is a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width. Parking areas adjacent to other developed parcels shall require a planting area that is a minimum ten (10) feet in width. Landscape buffers may be achieved through the use of earthen berms, shrubs, trees, or other appropriate materials to effectively screen the parking area from the rights-of-way. 
(2)  Interior Parking Areas. Planting shall be established to break up the interior of all parking areas. Landscape planting islands shall be a minimum of eight feet (8) in width to ensure adequate room for planting. Interior landscaping shall be comprised of one canopy tree and three shrubs for every fifteen (15) parking spaces. 
(3)  Lighting. Lighting provided to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be so arranged, shielded, and directed upon the parking area in such a manner as to not reflect or cause glare into adjacent properties or interfere with street traffic. Lighting shall be in accordance with the Lighting standards listed above. 
(4)  Inspections. At the time the structure receives its final inspection, the completion of the landscaping in accordance with these requirements shall also be a part of the final inspection. However, if seasonal circumstances do not permit the planting of the required landscaping, the developer may post a bond in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the installed landscape cost, and may delay installation up to six (6) months. The final inspection of the landscaping shall be performed at a reasonable, later date as determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
3.11-13. - Landscaping. 
    This section provides minimum standards for all landscaping required by this Ordinance. 
a.  Basic Standards. This section shall apply to new property development and any expansion of existing legally conforming sites or structures that exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the existing site or structure. 
(1)  All plant materials must be kept in a healthy condition. No artificial plants shall be considered toward minimum landscaping requirements. Dead plants must be removed and replaced as necessary. 
(2)  All portions of the site where existing vegetative cover is damaged or removed, that are not otherwise covered with new improvements, shall be successfully re-vegetated with a mix of native, adaptive and drought tolerant grasses and ground covers. The density of the reestablished vegetation must be adequate to prevent soil erosion and invasion of weeds after one growing season. 
(3)  All plant materials shall be installed in the best possible manner to ensure their continued viability. Shrub and flower beds must be lined with a weed barrier mesh (or similar material designed for weed control) to prevent the introduction of noxious weeds. 
(4)  All required landscaping must be located on the property it serves. 
(5)  All required landscaping must be located outside of any adjacent right-of-way unless otherwise stated by the Zoning Administrator. 
(6)  Landscaping shall be used to screen from view uses, such as trash enclosures, storage areas, mechanical equipment, loading docks, and similar items where such areas are visible from roads, sidewalks or open space. 
(7)  Non-living ground cover may include decorative gravel, bark mulch, river rock, or similar materials. Decorative elements, such as walks, decks, terraces, water features, and similar features may be included. Planting beds may not contain more than fifty percent (50%) non-living ground cover. 
(8)  All plants used for landscaping shall be compatible with the local climate and the soils, drainage, and water conditions of the site. When planting occurs on hillsides, slopes, drainage ways, or similar natural areas, plant material should duplicate adjacent plant communities both in species composition and special distribution patterns. Whenever possible, drought-resistant varieties of plant materials shall be utilized. 
(9)  Healthy trees, native vegetation, and natural or significant rock outcroppings and other valuable features shall be preserved and integrated within planting areas. Existing healthy trees and shrubs that are preserved shall count towards the landscaping standards of this section. 
(10)  To ensure healthy plant materials are installed in new development, trees and shrubs shall comply with the following standards. 
i.  Deciduous Trees. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches (2?) in caliper measured four (4) inches above the ground. 
ii.  Coniferous Trees. Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height, measured from the top of the root ball to the top of the tree.

    All proceedings brought under this section shall be subject to the Rules of Procedure of the Plan Commission, where not inconsistent with the procedure otherwise stated herein. 
3.14-22. - Limitation of Rezoning. 
    The Plan Commission shall not initiate any amendments to the zoning map concerning the property involved in a Planned Unit Development before completion of the development as long as the development is in conformity with the Approved Final Detailed Planned Unit Development and is proceeding in accordance with the time requirements imposed herein. 
3.14-23. - PUD Amendment Process. 
    The Zoning Administrator may approve only minor modifications of the Approved Final Detailed Planned Unit Development in a manner consistent with the approved development. Such modifications shall not include any increase in density, any lessening of aesthetic treatments, any alteration of frontage or building location, any change in type of use, or any change in access or circulation, or drainage. 
a.  The Zoning Administrator shall have discretion on the amount of changes allowed to be made on changes to the Approved Final Detailed Planned Unit Development before going back to the Plan Commission. 
4.0. - NON-CONFORMING USES 

4.1. - General Purpose. 
    Non-conforming uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the Districts in which such uses are located. These were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but they are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or may be under future amendments hereto. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. Within the districts established by this Ordinance or by amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist, singularly or in combination: 
a.  Nonconforming lots; 
b.  Nonconforming structures; 
c.  Nonconforming uses of land; and 
d.  Nonconforming uses of land and structures in combination. 
    A nonconforming lot, structure or use of land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the District in which such use is located. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or development on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined as work done which is beyond the preparation stage and into that stage where the changes or additions are made permanent. 
    The process for determining abandonment shall be followed by the process set forth in the 7.9 Notice of Abandonment. 
4.2. - Non-Conforming Lots of Record. 
a.  In the Single Family Detached District (R-SF), Medium Density Residential Special Zone District (R-MD-SZ) and the High Density Residential Special Zone District (R-HD-SZ), notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on any single legal lot of record as of the effective date of the adoption of this Ordinance. The lot must be in separate ownership, included in a subdivision of record in the Office of the Lake County Recorder, and not of contiguous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable to the district. Yard dimensions, including yard requirements not involving area or width of the lot, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located. Variances of requirements listed in Section 7.0 of this Ordinance, other than lot area or lot width, shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Note: This section shall apply only to single-family residences.) 
b.  If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance. 
c.  A nonconforming lot may be continued but may not be extended, expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use. 
d.  If any nonconforming use of lot ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the land, structure, or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
4.3. - Non-Conforming Structures. 
a.  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not now be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provision: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
b.  Any nonconforming structure damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty to the extent of not more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, may be reconstructed and used as before if the following apply: 
(1)  Reconstruction has begun within twelve (12) months of the casualty and construction completed within thirty-six (36) months of commencement. An extension may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(2)  The restored structure has no greater coverage and contains no greater cubic content than before the casualty. 
(3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
c.  Any nonconforming structure damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, may not be reconstructed and used as before. 
d.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals approves of the change. 
e.  If any nonconforming structure ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the land, structure, or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
4.4. - Non-Conforming Uses of Land. 
    Where, at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided: 
a.  No such conforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. 
b.  No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. 
c.  If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned, as defined in the Section 7.9 Notice of Abandonment for more than one year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
d.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
e.  A nonconforming use of land may be continued but may not be extended, expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use. 
f.  An existing nonconforming use which occupies only a portion of an existing structure may be extended throughout the structure, provided the change or extension does not eliminate, displace, prevent, or restrict the continuance of any then existing use being concurrently carried on in the structure which conforms with the requirement of this Ordinance. 
g.  If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the land, structure, or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
h.  Accessory dwelling units in existence prior to the adoption of this Ordinance shall be considered pre-existing, nonconforming uses and shall follow the standards set forth in this section. 
4.5. - Non-Conforming Uses or Structures and Land in Combination. 
a.  If a lawful use involving individual structures, or a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that would not now be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(2)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(3)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned as defined in the Section 6.9 Notice of Abandonment for more than one (1) year (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(4)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
b.  A nonconforming use of land, or structure, or both in combination may be continued but may not be extended, expanded, or changed unless to a conforming use. 
c.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure and land, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals approves of the change. 
d.  If any nonconforming use of lot, use of land, or structure, or in combination ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the land, structure, or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
4.6. - Distinction Between Illegal Non-Conforming and Legal Non-Conforming Structures and Uses. 
a.  An illegal nonconforming use is: 
(1)  A use, lot or structure that was constructed in violation of this Ordinance; or 
(2)  A use that was initiated in violation of this Ordinance; or 
(3)  A use that was legally initiated, but abandoned for a period of one (1) year. 
b.  An illegal nonconforming use or structure is subject to actions and penalties allowed by the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable City laws. Such structure or use shall be made to conform to all applicable standards and regulations of this Ordinance. 
c.  A legal nonconforming structure or use results from a change in the provisions of the ordinance that renders non-compliant a structure or use that previously conformed to the ordinance. The non-compliance is not a result of the fault or inappropriate action of the owner, tenant, or property manager 
4.7. - Repairs and Maintenance. 
a.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure and market value of real estate, or nonconforming portion of the structure, whichever the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
b.  Any nonconforming use damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty to the extent of not more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage, may be reconstructed and used as before if the following apply: 
(1)  Reconstruction has begun within twelve (12) months of the casualty and construction completed within thirty-six (36) months of commencement. An extension may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(2)  The restored structure has no greater coverage and contains no greater cubic content than before the casualty. 
(3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
c.  Any nonconforming use damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, or other casualty to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to the damage may not be reconstructed and used as before.

d.  Technological Impracticality-Request for Waiver. In the event the strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would make it impossible for the owner of a large satellite television dish of greater than one meter to receive a usable satellite signal, make it impossible for the holder of any amateur radio license to enjoy the full benefits of an FCC license or right, or in the event the property owner or licensed holder believes alternatives exist that are less burdensome to adjacent property owners, the owner or licensee contact the Zoning Administrator for a waiver from these provisions. The Zoning Administrator may grant such a waiver upon findings that either: 
(1)  Actual compliance with the existing provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinance would prevent the large satellite television dish from receiving a usable satellite signal or prevent an individual from exercising the rights granted to him or her by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) by license, law or FCC regulation; 
(2)  The alternatives proposed by the property owner or licensee constitute the minimum necessary to permit acquisition of a usable satellite signal by a large satellite television dish or to exercise the rights granted pursuant to a valid FCC license, law, or FCC regulation. 
(3)  Less Burdensome Alternatives. The Zoning Administrator is also authorized to consider the request of adjacent property owners for waivers consistent with the provisions of paragraph (F)(1) of this section without the requirement of a finding a usable satellite signal cannot be acquired when the applicant's adjacent property owner(s) establish the alternatives proposed by the applicant are less burdensome to the adjacent property owners than the requirements which would otherwise be imposed under this Ordinance. For example, adjacent property owners may request alternative additional screening or the relocation of the antenna on the licensee's property. The Zoning Administrator shall attempt to balance the impact of the tower on the views of adjacent properties, as well as the impacts of alternative screening and relocation in order to equitably distribute any negative impacts among the neighbors while imposing reasonable conditions on the antenna or dish, its location and screening that do not impair the rights granted by the FCC to the licensee. 
(4)  The process shall be interactive in which the Zoning Administrator works with the licensee to craft conditions that place the minimum burden on adjacent property owners while permitting the owner of the large satellite television dish or holder of an amateur radio license to exercise the rights which he or she has been granted by federal law. For example, the number of antennas and size of the array shall be no greater than that necessary to enjoy full use of the FCC license. Conditions may include but are not limited to requirements for screening and landscaping, review of the color, reflectivity and mass of the proposed satellite television antenna or amateur radio facilities, and other reasonable restrictions consistent with the intent of the City Council that a waiver be granted only when necessary to permit the satellite television antenna to acquire usable satellite signal or to allow the licensee to exercise the rights granted by Federal Communication Commission license while preserving the aesthetic harmony of the community. The process employed should involve the interaction of the licensee or owner and the neighborhood. Certain issues have been pre-empted by federal law and shall not be considered by the Zoning Administrator. Such issues include, but are not limited to, the impacts of electromagnetic radiation, the potential interference of the amateur radio facility with electronic devices in the neighborhood and any other matter pre-empted by federal law or regulation. Impact on view and on the values of neighboring properties may be considered in imposing reasonable conditions but shall not be a basis for denial of a permit to construct the antenna. 
(5)  The application fee and notification for consideration of the waiver by an owner of a satellite television antenna shall be same provided for processing a variance. No fee shall be charged to the holder of a valid FCC amateur radio license. 
e.  Maintenance. 
(1)  All equipment shall be maintained in good condition and in accordance with all requirements of this section. 
(2)  The equipment shall meet all manufacturers' specifications, and shall be of noncombustible and corrosive-resistant material. The miscellaneous hardware, such as brackets, turnbuckles, clips, or similar type equipment subject to rust or corrosion shall be protected with a suitable coating to guard against rust and corrosion. 
(3)  All equipment shall be subject to periodic re-inspection. No additions, changes, or modifications shall be made to equipment, unless the addition, change or modification is in conformity with this section.

(7)  Guidance of public and private policy and action to provide adequate and efficient public and private facilities, the most aesthetically pleasing and beneficial interrelationship between land use, and conservation of natural resources such as natural beauty, woodlands, open spaces, and energy, both during and after development. 
(8)  Causing the cost of design and installation of improvements in new, platted subdivisions to be borne by the persons purchasing the lots rather than by any direct or indirect burden upon existing property owners beyond the limits of the subdivision who have already paid for the improvements servicing their property. 
c.  Jurisdiction. This ordinance, which was enacted pursuant to Indiana home rule and planning enabling legislation (IC § 36-1-3-4 and the § 36-7-4-700 series, as amended), authorizes the Whiting Plan Commission to review and approve or disapprove plats for subdivisions within the jurisdictional area of the City of Whiting, Indiana. The Plan Commission is hereby authorized to waive any or all requirements of this section when a literal enforcement of this section would result in unnecessary hardships and when such waiver will not be contrary to the public interest. 
d.  Policy and Interpretation. 
(1)  No owner, or agent of the owner, of any parcel of land located in a proposed subdivision shall transfer or sell any such parcel before a plat of such subdivision has been approved by the Plan Commission, in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, and filed with the Lake County Recorder. 
(2)  The division of any lot or any parcel of land into a subdivision, as defined in this Ordinance, by the use of metes and bounds description for the purpose of sale, transfer, or lease resulting in the creation of one (1) or more new building sites shall not be permitted. All such described divisions shall be subject to all of the appropriate requirements of this Ordinance. 
(3)  Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be developed without peril to health, flood, fire, or other menace; and land shall not be subdivided until access to available existing public facilities, improvements, and proper provisions have been made for drainage, water, sewerage, other necessary new public improvements such as schools, parks, recreation facilities, and transportation facilities adequate for serving the subdivision. 
(4)  No plat or re-plat of a subdivision of land located within the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission shall be recorded until it has been approved by the Plan Commission, and such approval shall have been entered in writing on the plat by the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission. 
(5)  No land shall be subdivided unless the intended use of the individual lot is in conformance with all provisions of this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan, now or hereafter adopted. 
(6)  In all subdivisions, due regard shall be given to the preservation of historical sites and natural features such as large trees, water courses, and scenic views. 
(7)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(8)  Conflict with Public and Private Provision: 
i.  Public Provisions: The regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control. 
ii.  Private Provisions: These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the requirement of these regulations, or the determinations of the Plan Commission in providing a subdivision or in enforcing these regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with these regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and determinations made thereunder. (Note: Private provisions can only be enforced privately, unless a public agency has been made party to such agreements.) 
(9)  No Improvement Location Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or plat of land that was created by subdivision after the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with the regulations contained herein. 
(10)  These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations. 
(11)  These regulations shall not apply to the following: 
i.  An adjustment of lot lines as shown on a recorded plat which does not reduce the area, frontage, width, depth, or building setback lines of each building site below the minimum zoning requirements, and does not change the original number of lots in any block of the recorded plat. 
ii.  A division of land into two (2) or more tracts for an agricultural use.

Subsequent to the primary approval, the model home(s) may be constructed, subject to such additional requirements that the Plan Commission may require. 
6.4. - Surety. 
a.  Performance Bonds. 
(1)  At the time when the secondary plat is approved by the Plan Commission and before the plat is signed by the officers of the Plan Commission or is recorded, the subdivider shall file a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit with the Clerk-Treasurer and the City Council. The performance bond or letter of credit shall: 
i.  Be drawn in favor of the City of Whiting. 
ii.  Be in an amount determined by the Plan Commission to be sufficient to complete the improvements and installations in compliance with this Ordinance. The subdivider's engineer shall supply an opinion of the probable cost of improvements and installation on the project to aid the Plan Commission in its determination of the amount of the bond. The engineer's opinion, however, shall not be binding upon the Plan Commission. 
iii.  Be with surety satisfactory to the Plan Commission and City Council. 
iv.  Comply with all statutory requirements and be satisfactory to the Plan Commission's Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. 
v.  Extend for two (2) years, or eighty (80) percent complete, or as specified by the Plan Commission in the resolution approving the secondary subdivision plat. 
vi.  Cover the installation costs of the streets, sanitary sewers, curbs, street signs, sidewalks, and other recreational amenities, surface swales, subsurface and storm drainage systems, seeding/erosion control, landscaping, and other public improvements. 
(2)  The Plan Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the City Council extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one (1) additional year. The City Council may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond upon recommendation of the Plan Commission's Attorney. The City Council shall have the authority to increase the bond amount to cover increased costs. 
(3)  All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the local government or any improvement district therein. 
(4)  The subdivider shall be required to maintain at his expense a licensed civil engineer or engineering firm to manage the construction of the subdivision improvements. The managing engineer shall certify that the subdivision construction is in compliance with the detailed construction plans submitted to the Plan Commission during the review of the secondary plat. The managing engineer shall submit progress reports to the City Engineer as substantial steps are completed and should notify the City Engineer when important work has been scheduled so that an inspection can be made. A final report shall be submitted to the Plan Commission and the City Council by the engineer or his firm. 
(5)  If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for correcting any errors in construction and completing the improvements in accordance with such standards and specifications. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. 
(6)  If a secondary plat is divided into sections, the Plan Commission may allow for performance bonds to be submitted to cover only the cost of improvements to be constructed in each section. 
b.  Release of Performance Bond. 
(1)  The City Council and Board of Works shall not accept dedication of required improvements nor release or reduce the performance bond amount until the City Engineer has submitted a final inspection report of the subdivision. The engineer shall certify that the layout of the public improvements has been completed and properly inspected and is ready for acceptance into the City's system. 
(2)  The City Council and Board of Works, upon approval of the City Engineer's inspection report, shall pass a resolution accepting the improvements in the subdivision and formally releasing the performance bond. 
(3)  In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the City Council may thereupon declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default. 
c.  Other Forms of Surety. 
(1)  The subdivider may provide the City Council with other liquid assets in an amount equal to the required performance and maintenance bonds. Such liquid assets may include a cash escrow account, certificate of deposit, irrevocable letter of credit, money market accounts, etc., so long as the proper documents are presented by the subdivider to the City Council giving said Council proper signatory access to the funds upon default. 
    Should the subdivider be required to extend site improvements to the subdivision, such as extensions of water and sewer lines owned by the City of Whiting, which may provide benefits to other properties in the vicinity of the proposed subdivision, then the subdivider and the City Council may, by contract, agree that the other property owners in the vicinity of the subdivision who wish to connect to or utilize the installation provided by the subdivider shall pay the City over a ten (10) year period a fee in an amount agreed to by the contract, and that portion of said fee shall be rebated to the subdivider in annual installments. After the installation of any utility by the applicant, an expiration date of fifteen (15) years shall be maintained. Thus, after fifteen (15) years from the time of completion, no monies shall be paid to the applicant 
6.5. - Principles and Standards of Design. 
a.  General. 
(1)  The subdivision layout shall be of such a character that it protects the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents in the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission.

iv.  Livability or amenities as affected by traffic elements in the circulation system; and 
v.  Economy of both construction and use of land. 
(4)  When there is a situation of unusual physical conditions or a controlled design environment in evidence, and it can be satisfactorily demonstrated to the Plan Commission that a private street is the only feasible solution, said private streets may be authorized provided pavement construction standards shall be the same as the minimum public standard and adequate covenant provisions are made for direct responsibility and control by the property owners involved to provide for the perpetual operation, liability, and maintenance of said private streets at no expense to the City of Whiting. 
(5)  In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following rules, laws, and regulations:

vii.  The "Indiana Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices" for installation of traffic control devices. 
b.  Street Standards. 
(1)  The street and alley layout shall provide adequate vehicular and pedestrian access to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision and where streets cross other streets. Streets shall conform to the following principles and standards. 
i.  Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. 
ii.  Residential street systems shall be designed to minimize through-traffic movement, but certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to be subdivided so as to provide for normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity.

If such application complies with this Ordinance and all other applicable codes or ordinances, the Zoning Administrator shall issue the Improvement Location Permit for the use authorized by special exception. 
d.  A special exception shall not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for a special exception is submitted to the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Zoning Appeals containing: 
(1)  Name, address, and phone number of applicant; owner of the property; and any person(s) holding options on the purchase of the property for the intended special use. 
(2)  Legal description of the property with common address of the property being considered; 
(3)  Description of proposed special use and all accessory uses or structures, with square footage and height listed;

(1)  Upon receipt of an application for special exception, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for public hearing. A copy of the application shall be referred concurrently to the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall provide the Board of Zoning Appeals with a written advisory recommendation for the special exception to ensure the proposal is in coordination with the Comprehensive Plan. The Plan Commission must return their report of findings to the Zoning Administrator within ten (10) days after they receive the application. The Zoning Administrator shall report the findings to the Board of Zoning Appeals prior to the scheduled hearing of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(2)  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall file a petition to the City Council with a favorable recommendation, unfavorable recommendation, or no recommendation if and only if:

The City Council shall direct the Zoning Administrator to either issue an Improvement Location Permit for the special exception or reject the application. 
i.  Delay. Any person who is issued an Improvement Location Permit for a special exception must begin construction within nine (9) months after the permit is issued; complete the special exception within seven (7) years after such construction has begun; and conform to the provisions of any restrictions or conditions which the Board of Zoning Appeals and/or the City Council imposed in conjunction with approval of the special exception upon the basis of which the Improvement Location Permit was issued.

Chapter 1. - PLAN COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE RULES OF PROCEDURE 
[INTRODUCTION] 
Many planning and zoning commissions can improve through establishment and utilization of a good set of administrative rules. Rules set forth the organizational aspects of the commissions and establish a definite procedure for conducting business. The rules should include sections on officers and employees, meetings, order of business, committees, and public hearings. In addition to being required by the planning statutes of the state, rules are essential because each commission member should be aware, without question, of how the commission operates. The general public, developers and community officials should also be able to determine at any time how the commission conducts its business. 
As a commission if a set of rules and procedures is adopted the commission must follow them. Should the commission disregard the adopted rules and procedures, it may be opening itself to serious legal problems if a petitioner appeals the commission's decision. The Whiting Plan Commission has determined that a set of administrative rules and procedures is imperative to the efficiency of the commission and to the effectiveness to perform its duties. 
Therefore, the following administrative rules and procedures for the Whiting Plan Commission are documented in article form with the articles further divided into sections.

Chapter 2. - BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS RULES AND PROCEDURES 
[INTRODUCTION] 
    Like many planning and zoning commissions, a board of zoning appeals can improve with the establishment of and through the utilization of a good set of administrative rules. Thorough and well-thought administrative rules set forth the organizational aspects of the Board and establish a definite procedure for conducting Board business. The administrative rules should include sections on officers and employees, meetings, order of business, committees, and public hearings. In addition to being required by the planning statutes of the state, administrative rules are essential because each board member should be aware, without question, of how the Board conducts business and operates. Furthermore, land developers, community officials and the general public should be able to determine, at any time, how the Board conducts its business and operates. 
    As a final note, if a set of rules and procedures are adopted, the Board must follow them. If the Board disregards the adopted rules and procedures, the Board may be opening itself to serious legal problems if a petitioner appeals its decision. However, if the Board opts not to establish or adopt a set of rules and procedures, certain minimum standards of administrative procedure will be implied. 
    The following Administrative Rules and Procedures for the Whiting Board of Zoning Appeals are documented in article form with the individual articles further divided into sections. Upon adoption by the Whiting Board of Zoning Appeals, these Administrative Rules and Procedures will become the official set of rules and procedures governing the Board's operation and business and all Whiting Board of Zoning Appeals meetings, hearings, and official actions. 
    All references to the State local planning legislation of the Indiana Code are coded with an "IC", and all references to the Whiting Municipal Code are coded with "WMC".

    In accordance with IC § 36-7-4-918.5 and WMC 17.64.060, the Board shall approve or deny variances from the development standards (such as height, bulk, or area) of the zoning ordinance. A variance may be approved under this section only upon a determination in writing that: 
1.  The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community; 
2.  The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; 
3.  The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to the property involved, specifically the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
4.  The strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property. However, the zoning ordinance may establish a stricter standard than the practical difficulties' standard prescribed by this subdivision. 
5.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
6.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and 
7.  The approval does not interfere substantially with the official Comprehensive Plan for the City of Whiting adopted under the 500 SERIES COMPREHENSIVE PLAN of the Indiana Code. 
Section 3. - Granting Variances. 
A.  In accordance with WMC 17.64.060, the Board shall authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the WMC title as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the title would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the title shall be observed and substantial justice done. No such variances shall be granted by the Board unless and until: 
1.  A written application for a variance is submitted indicating the section or sections of the zoning ordinance and title or titles under which the variance is sought and stating the grounds in which the variance is requested; 
2.  Notice of such hearing shall be given in accordance with Article VI. Section 6, titled Notice of Hearings of these Administrative Rules and Procedures; 
3.  A public hearing shall be held at which any party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney; 
4.  The Board shall make a finding or findings that the requirements of sections 1 and 2 of this Article have been met. 
5.  The Board shall further make finding that: 
a.  Granting the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building, and that the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish the relief sought by the applicant; and 
b.  Granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
B.  No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
C.  Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this title in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this title in said district. 
D.  In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall deem a violation of this title. 
ARTICLE XI. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND USES 

Section 1. - Exceptions and Uses. 
    In accordance with IC § 36-7-4-918.2, a Board shall approve or deny all: 
1.  Special exceptions, as defined; 
2.  Special uses, as defined; 
3.  Contingent uses, as defined; and 
4.  Conditional uses, as defined; 
from the terms of the zoning ordinance, but only in the classes of cases or in the particular situations specified in the zoning ordinance. The Board may impose reasonable conditions as a part or its approval. 
Section 2. - Granting Special Exceptions and Uses. 
A.  In accordance with WMC 17.64.050 subsection (a), the Board shall hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this title, upon which the Board is required to act under this title, permit and authorize exceptions to the district regulations only in the classes of cases or in particular situations as specified in the title. A special exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until: 
(1)  A written application for a special exception is submitted indicating the section of the zoning ordinance and title under which the special exception is sought and stating the grounds in which it is requested; 
(2)  Notice of such hearing shall be given in accordance with Article VI. Section 6. Titled Notice of Hearings of these Administrative Rules and Procedures; 
(3)  A public hearing shall be held at which any party may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. 
(4)  The Board shall make a finding that it is empowered under this title to grant the special exception, and that the granting will not adversely affect the public interest. 
B.  In accordance with WMC 17.64.050 subsection (b), In granting any special exception, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the zoning ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the zoning ordinance. The Board shall prescribe a time limit within the action for which the special exception is required shall be begun, completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete of both such actions within the time limit set shall void the special exception. 
ARTICLE XII. - EXCEPTION, USE, OR VARIANCE COMMITMENT BY OWNER 

Section 1. - Commitment by Owner. 
A.  In accordance with IC § 36-7-4-921, in case of a petition for a special exception, Special use, contingent use, conditional use, or variance form the terms of the zoning ordinance, the Board may permit or require the owner of a parcel of property to make a written commitment concerning the use or development of that parcel. 
B.  The Board may: 
1.  Adopt rules governing the creation, form, recording, modification, enforcement, and termination of commitments; and 
2.  Adopt rules designating which specially affected persons and classes of specially affected persons are entitled to enforce commitments.

Unless modified or terminated by the Board, a commitment is binding on the owner of the parcel, each subsequent owner, and each other person acquiring an interest in the parcel. A commitment is binding on the owner of the parcel even if it is unrecorded; however, an unrecorded commitment is binding on subsequent owner or other persons acquiring an interest in the parcel only if that subsequent owner or other person has actual notice of the commitment. A commitment may be modified or terminated only by a decision of the Board made at a public hearing after notice as provided by rule. 
D.  By permitting or requiring commitments, a Board does not obligate itself to approve or deny any request. 
E.  Conditions imposed on the granting of an exception, use, or variance are not subject to the rules applicable to commitments. 
F.  This section does not affect the validity of any covenant, easement, equitable servitude, or other land use restriction created in accordance with law. 
ARTICLE XIII. - ALTERNATE PROCEDURE (RESERVED)
