PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Lemont, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented through September 7, 2008, and ordinances adopted by the mayor and board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. Some titles are reserved for later use. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. Sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Daryl Jaquette, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Benjamin P. Wehmeier, Village Administrator, and Mr. Daniel P. Blondin, Village Attorney, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

(a)  In this section, the term "violation of this Code" means: 
(1)  Doing an act that is prohibited, made or declared unlawful or an offense by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance; 
(2)  The failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance; or 
(3)  The failure to perform an act if the failure is prohibited, made or declared unlawful or an offense by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance. 
(b)  A person is also guilty of a violation of this Code if the person counsels, aids, or abets in a violation of this Code. 
(c)  A corporation may be prosecuted for a violation of this Code committed by any officer, agent, or employee of the corporation where the offense is committed while such person is acting within the scope of the person's office, employment or agency, or the commission of such offense is authorized, requested, commanded, performed, permitted, allowed, or by neglect of such corporation. An officer or any other agent who has a position of comparable authority for the formulation of corporate policy or the supervision of subordinate employees in a managerial capacity is legally accountable for any offense committed in the name of or in behalf of the corporation to the same extent as if it were performed in his own name and behalf and may be prosecuted for violations of this Code. Prosecutions for violations may be jointly, severally or in the alternative against any of the above-named persons. Persons jointly liable for any violations may be prosecuted under one complaint. 
(d)  In all cases where a violation is made punishable under more than one section or provision of any village code or regulation, the prosecuting officer may proceed under one or more of the applicable sections or provisions, but in no case shall more than one penalty be imposed upon a person for a single violation except that the revocation of a license or permit or the issuance and any injunction, stop order or similar cease and desist order shall not be considered a penalty so as to bar any other penalty from being imposed. 
(e)  In this section, the term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a village officer or village employee to perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is clear from the context that it is the intent to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the officer or employee. 
(f)  Except as otherwise provided: 
(1)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50.00 and not more than $750.00. For certain violations, successful completion of a drug/alcohol/tobacco/theft education program with a court-approved curriculum may also be required for any one offense. 
(2)  With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
(3)  With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each act is a separate offense. 
(4)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief or administrative adjudication of violations of this Code. 
(g)  That prior to the issuance of any license, certificate and/or permit required pursuant to the laws and ordinances of the Village of Lemont, the village clerk, or his/her duly designated agent, shall ascertain that there are no unpaid charges for water service, other municipal services or any other municipal fees, fines, judgments, levies or debts then due and unpaid. No such license, certificate or permit shall be approved or issued until such time as the applicant presents to the appropriate department a certificate of the village clerk, or his/her duly designated agent, indicating that all charges, fees, assessments, fines, judgments, levies or debts, owed to the Village have been paid in full.

Such service charges shall be paid within seven days of notification, in cash, money order, certified check or credit card before the bill, fine, charge or fee, for which such check was rendered, shall be considered paid. If said service charge is not paid, the check will be sent for collection, and the maker of the check or draft will incur all costs involved with the process, or $25.00, whichever is greater. Should two such checks or drafts be returned within a one-year period, no further payments shall be accepted from such person except in the form of cash, certified check, cashier's check, money order or credit card for a period of three months from the date of the return of the second check or draft.

The corporation counsel may retain attorneys and collection agents for the purpose of collecting any unpaid fee, fine, charge, cost or other expense due and owing to the village. 
    The village shall add all retained attorney and collection agent fees and costs incurred as a result of the collection for the unpaid balance of the fee, fine, charge, cost or other expense due and owing to the village.

    Those fees and costs shall include any default of any fee, fine, charge, cost or other expense previously imposed that was referred to an attorney or collection agent and the payment of which remains outstanding.

(1)  Section 1. Rules statement. It is the decision of the village that any member of the corporate authority may attend any open or closed meeting of the corporate authority via electronic means, such as by telephone, video or internet connection; provided that such attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws. 
(2)  Section 2. Prerequisites. A member of the corporate authority may attend a meeting electronically if the member meets the following conditions: 
a.  The member should notify the clerk and village administration at least eight hours before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance. 
b.  The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he is unable to physically attend the meeting: 
1.  The member cannot attend because of personal illness or disability; 
2.  The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the business of the village; or 
3.  The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency. 
(3)  Section 3. Authorization to participate. 
a.  The clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance request, shall inform the corporate authority of the request for electronic attendance. 
b.  After establishing that there is a quorum physically present at a meeting where a member of the corporate authority desires to attend electronically, the presiding officer shall state that: 1. a notice was received by a member of the corporate authority in accordance with these rules; and 2. the member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the members of the corporate authority physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by the members of the corporate authority physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed approved by the corporate authority and the presiding officer shall declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by the presiding officer, the question of a member's electronic attendance may not be reconsidered. 
(4)  Section 4. Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically and other members of the corporate authority must be able to communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the corporate authority shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site. 
(5)  Section 5. Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic means. 
(6)  Section 6. Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express his comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his vote counted and recorded by the clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his leaving and returning. 
(7)  Section 7. Meetings concerning bond issuance. At a meeting where the corporate authority is to vote on the issuance of bonds by the village, and a member meets the prerequisites under subsection (2) of this section, a roll call vote to allow electronic attendance is required.

Provided, any failure to adhere to the provisions of this section, and any such restriction or limitation upon any speaker, shall not impair or affect any ordinance, resolution, motion or other action of the board.

    For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

The procedure for suspension or revocation of any license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be as follows: 
(1)  Notice of hearing on suspension or revocation of license. Except as provided in subsection (2) below, prior to the revocation or suspension of a license, the licensee be afforded a hearing before the mayor, and shall be served with a written notice stating the nature of the violations alleged and the date, time and place of a hearing at which the mayor will receive evidence concerning the alleged violation.

Notice of the hearing may also be sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the applicant for the license as stated on the license application, and service shall be deemed complete at the time the notice is deposited in the mail. The hearing date shall be set no sooner than five days after the date of service without the agreement of the licensee. 
(2)  Summary suspension pending expedited hearing. Where the village administrator, village attorney or the chief of police, or their respective designees, present to the mayor sufficient evidence demonstrating probable cause to believe that the licensee has violated this Code, other village ordinances, or state or federal laws or regulations, and that said violation will immediately threaten the public health, safety or welfare, the mayor may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such conclusion and without prior notice or hearing, order the licensed premises closed and the license summarily suspended pending a hearing and determination on suspension or revocation. Said hearing shall be commenced not more than seven days following entry of such an order, unless the licensee shall agree to a longer period of time. Upon entry of an order of summary suspension, the licensee shall be served with a copy of the order and notice of violation and hearing in the manner provided in subsection (1) above. 
(3)  Hearing on suspension or revocation. All hearings incident to the revocation or suspension of any license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be hearings of record. Any order of suspension or revocation shall be based on written findings of fact, and such findings shall be supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record. An order of suspension or revocation shall be served on the licensee in the manner provided in subsection (1) above. The failure of the licensee to appear at the hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the licensee's right to present evidence in denial of the complaint of violation or in mitigation of such punishment as may be imposed, and the mayor may proceed to make a determination on the complaint in the licensee's absence. The decision of the mayor shall be final.

a.  The disturbance of neighbors; 
b.  The recurrence of loud and obnoxious noises; 
c.  Repeated consumption of alcohol in public.

(d)  Procedure. 
(1)  When the chief of police of the village receives two or more police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a property, the chief of police shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe criminal acts. Upon such findings, the chief may: 
a.  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
1.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
2.  A statement that the chief of police has information that the property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The chief of police shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation; and 
3.  Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police within ten days to discuss the nuisance activities. 
(2)  After complying with the notification procedures described in subsection (d)(1) of this section, when the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall: 
a.  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
1.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property; 
2.  A statement that the chief of police has determined the property to be chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance activities leading to his findings; 
3.  Demand that the person in charge respond within ten days to the chief of police and propose a course of action that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation; 
4.  Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the determination by the chief of police; 
5.  A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if the occupant is different than the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid; 
6.  A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after ten days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of police; and 
7.  The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this chapter. 
b.  If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by the village pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a period of not less than ten nor more than 30 days. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within 30 days, the chief of police shall request authorization for the village attorney to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance. 
c.  Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth in this subsection, the chief of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as, any other documentation that supports legal proceedings to the village. 
(3)  When a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as required by this section, any conduct or statements made in connection with the furnishing of the response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the exclusion of any evidence that is otherwise admissible or offered for any other purpose. 
(e)  Commencement of action; burden of proof. 
(1)  In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(2)  It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(3)  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any of the following factors if they need be found, and shall cite those found to be applicable: 
a.  The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to mitigate or correct the problem at the property; 
b.  Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous; 
c.  The magnitude or gravity of the problem; 
d.  The cooperation of the person in charge with the village; and 
e.  The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(f)  Emergency closing procedures. 
(1)  In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for such interim relief, as is deemed by the chief of police to be appropriate. In such an event, the notification provisions set forth in subsection (d) of this section need not be complied with; however, the village shall make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing. 
(2)  In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a chronic nuisance property as defined in this section, the court may order the remedy as set out in subsection (b) of this section. In addition, in the event that it also finds the person in charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting a violation of this chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as provided in subsection (e) of this section. 
(3)  The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If used in this chapter, the term "costs" means that costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the property, as well as, tenant relocation costs. 
(4)  The village department of public works effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of cost and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
(5)  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the village. 
(6)  A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into the property, after either: 
a.  The owner or tenant received notice as described in this section of the police chief's determination as described in subsection (d)(2) of this section. 
b.  The unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought pursuant to this section.

8.16.040. - "Vacant building" determination. 
(a)  Within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter, the commissioner shall evaluate all buildings in the village believed to be unoccupied on the effective date of this chapter and make a determination for each as to whether the building is a "vacant building" within the meaning of this chapter. The commissioner may determine that a building which meets any of the criteria set forth in this chapter is not to be regulated under this chapter for a stated period, if upon consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient evidence, the commissioner determines that regulation of the building under this chapter would not serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes written findings in support of this decision. The determination shall be in writing and shall state the factual basis for the determination. 
(b)  For buildings the commissioner determines to be "vacant buildings," the commissioner shall, within seven days of making that determination, send notice of this written determination with the factual findings to the last recorded person, firm or corporation in possession of the property as listed on the most recent and applicable county recorder of deeds. Said notice of determination shall be sent first-class United States mail, with proper postage prepaid. Failure of delivery shall not excuse a person from complying with this chapter.

The appeal shall contain a complete statement of the reasons the owner disputes the commissioner's determination, shall set forth specific facts in support thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to support the appeal. The village manager shall decide the appeal on the basis of facts presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and the commissioner's written determination. 
(b)  The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to persuade the village manager that had the evidence been known to the commissioner at the time the commissioner made the determination, the commissioner would more likely than not have determined that the subject building was not a "vacant building" within the meaning of this chapter. 
(c)  The village manager shall send written notice of a decision to the owner prior to any inspections or issuance of citations. The village manager may, but is not required to, seek additional information from the owner or commissioner.

(Ord. No. O-60-10, 8-23-2010) 
8.16.060. - Obligation to register vacant buildings. 
    The owner of a building who knows, or should reasonably know, that his or her building is a "vacant building" within the meaning of this chapter after the effective date of this chapter, or the owner of a building, which the commissioner determines at any time to be a "vacant building," or the owner of a building whose appeal from the commissioner's determination has been denied by the village manager shall take the actions provided for in this section within 15 days after either the date of commissioner's notice of determination or occurrence of the facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the building was a "vacant building," or denial of the appeal, whichever is applicable. Registration does not exonerate the owner from compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances, including this chapter, nor does it preclude any of the actions the village is authorized to take pursuant to this chapter or elsewhere in the Village Code. 
(1)  a.  Register the building with the building department, on a form provided by the commissioner. The form shall include, as a minimum, the name, street address, and telephone number of the owner; the case name and number of any litigation pending concerning or affecting the building, including foreclosures and/or bankruptcy cases; and the name, street address, and telephone number of all persons with any legal interest in the building or the premises.

c.  File an amended registration within 15 days of any change in the information contained in the annual registration. 
(2)  The form shall require the owner to indicate his or her "Acceptance of Notice by Posting" consenting to service of notices sent or required to be sent, pursuant to this chapter, by posting on the building if the owner fails to renew the registration, if required, or maintain as current with the commissioner the information required regarding the person designated to accept notice and service of process. 
(3)  The owner shall allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building and shall be subject to village costs and fees outlined in section 8.16.140 of the Village Code within 30 days of the inspection. Such inspection will determine the extent of compliance with all applicable Village property, building, residential, electrical, plumbing, fire and similar codes. 
(4)  Vacant building plan. At the time a building is registered as required herein, the owner shall submit a vacant building plan. The commissioner may prescribe a form for the plan.

a.  A plan of action to repair any doors, windows, or other openings which are boarded up or otherwise secured by any means other than conventional methods used in the design of the building or permitted for new construction or similar type. The proposed repair shall result in openings being secured by conventional methods used in the design of the building or by methods permitted for new construction of similar type with board removed. The owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy. If the owner demonstrates that securing of the building will provide adequate protection to the public, the commissioner may waive the requirement of an enclosure; 
b.  For buildings and premises thereof that the commissioner determines as being or containing public nuisances, as defined in this chapter, then the vacant building plan shall contain a plan of action to remedy such public nuisance(s); 
c.  A time schedule identifying a date of commencement of repair and approximate date of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and nuisance identified by the commissioner; 
d.  When the owner proposes to demolish the vacant building, then the owner shall submit a plan and time schedule for such demolition; 
e.  A plan of action to maintain the building and premises thereof in conformance with this chapter; 
f.  A plan of action, with a time schedule, identifying the approximate date the building will be habitable and approximate date it will be occupied or offered for occupancy or sale. No plan which provides for compliance with this chapter or, which will not, as determined by the Commissioner, achieve such compliance, within six months, in the case of a vacant boarded building, and two years, in the case of a vacant, unboarded, and code compliant building will be approved; 
g.  All premises upon which unoccupied or vacant buildings are located and the exteriors shall at all times be maintained in compliance with the Village Code; and 
h.  Exterior lighting according to standards established by the commissioner.

(2)  The effect of the building and the proposed plan on adjoining property; 
(3)  The length of time the building has been vacant; 
(4)  The presence of any public nuisances on the property; and

(Ord. No. O-60-10, 8-23-2010)

(Ord. No. O-60-10, 8-23-2010) 
8.16.120. - Time restrictions-Vacant buildings. 
    It is the policy of the village that boarding is a temporary solution to prevent unauthorized entry into a vacant building and that boarded buildings are a public nuisance. A vacant building may not remain boarded longer than six months unless an extension of that time is part of a plan approved by the commissioner. 
    A vacant building which is unboarded and code-compliant and for which boarding is determined by the commissioner on the basis of police reports, citizen complaints, and other information of other type considered reliable by reasonable persons, to not require boarding to prevent unauthorized entry may not remain vacant for more than two years without an approved plan for occupancy, sale, demolition, or other disposition of the building.

(e)  Unless a bona fide emergency, as determined in the sole discretion of the commissioner, neither the village nor a contractor engaged on its behalf, shall enter upon private property to perform maintenance or otherwise alter the property without first obtaining the written permission of the property's owner or an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.

Upon receipt of the appeal notice and bond, if applicable, a time certain shall be set for a hearing.

(c)  The village administrator or his designee shall serve as hearing officer, and the burden of proof shall be upon the appellant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the alarm signal in question was not a false alarm. 
(d)  After receipt of all relevant evidence, the hearing officer shall, within three days, render his decision. If the hearing officer determines that the appellant has met the burden of proof, then he shall order the bond released to the appellant and/or rescind the false alarm determination.

(Code 1988, § 12.30.090) 
12.30.100. - Security. 
(a)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The village engineer (director of public works) may grant a variance to the security requirement due to the limitation in scope of work. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and 
(3)  The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Provide a location convenient to the village and within the state at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village engineer (director of public works) and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase, the village engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals.

(b)  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
(1)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way, including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the director of public works or his duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him as to what steps have been taken for the protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.

(b)  Authority of director to grant. The director of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
(c)  Conditions for granting. The director of public works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
(1)  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility, such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line, create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the director of public works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
(e)  Appeals. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including the denial of a variance, made by the director of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the village administrator. If the village administrator upholds the decision of the public works director, the utility has the right to appeal to the village board of trustees, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board of trustees shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal.

Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. 
(Code 1988, § 12.30.220) 
12.30.230. - Enforcement; village may seek additional remedies.

15.12.030. - Grease recovery systems. 
(a)  Grease recovery system requirements. 
(1)  Plumbing systems for institutions or commercial establishments in which grease, fats, culinary oils, or similar waste products from kitchens or food processing areas are wasted in connection with utensil, vat, dish, or floor cleaning processes, shall include grease recovery systems. All waste lines and drains carrying grease, fats, or culinary oils, in the above type establishments shall be director to one or more interceptors. 
(2)  All required grease interceptors shall comply with the following: 
a.  Material and covers. Grease interceptors shall be constructed of durable, corrosion resistant materials and shall have water-tight covers, securely fastened in place. 
b.  Minimum size. A grease interceptor installed on the same floor as the fixture shall have one-half the liquid holding capacity of the fixture. A grease interceptor located on a floor below the fixture shall have 60 percent of the liquid holding capacity of the fixture. To determine the liquid holding capacity in gallons of a plumbing fixture, multiply the length by the height in inches and divide by 231. Where two or more sinks or receptacles are connected to an interceptor, the liquid holding capacity shall be based on the combined volume of the fixtures served. The flow rate of the interceptor shall be sufficient to handle the maximum demand of the connected system. 
c.  Prohibited discharge. Grease interceptors shall not receive the discharge from a food waste disposal or a commercial dishwashing machine. 
d.  High temperature dishwater or sink discharge. Wastewater that exceeds 150 degrees Fahrenheit is prohibited from being discharged into the grease recovery system. 
e.  Accessibility . All interceptors shall be installed in an accessible location to permit the convenient removal of the lid and internal contents. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    FOG means fats, oils, greases, starch, proteins, waxes, free fatty acids, calcium and magnesium soaps, mineral oils, and certain other materials from animal, vegetable, and petroleum origins. FOG may originate from discharges from scullery sinks, pot and pan sinks, dishwashing machines, soup kettles, and floor drains located in areas where grease containing materials may exist. 
    Grease recovery system means a system of interceptors, separators, traps or grease recovery devices, which prevents free floating grease, fats and oils from entering the sewage system by recovering and removing these substances from wastewater. Such systems may be inside a building (typically less than 100 gallon capacity) or outside a building (typically 1,000 gallon or greater capacity). 
    Hauler means a waste disposal or rendering business or firm, licensed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, that hauls and disposes of fats, oils, and grease wastes as described in the ordinance. 
    Manifest means a log or document record of the hauler containing the name, address and state license/permit number, and the volume, date of removal and disposal destination of pumped materials or wastes from a grease trap or other interceptor device. 
    Pump and return method means the method of recanting any removed contents back into the grease recovery system from which it was removed or to any other grease recovery system or sewer connection. 
    User means any FOG producing facility, its owner(s) or operator(s) or their agent(s) that contributes to the Village of Lemont sewer system. 
(c)  Grease interceptors. 
(1)  Grease interceptors required . All users are required to have a grease interceptor with size to be determined by Illinois State Code. Exception: A coffee shop that serves only coffee and pre-packaged foods and does not cook or prepare any food on site. If the establishment serves anything other than coffee and pre-packaged floods (not made on site), i.e., soup, sandwiches, etc., they shall be required to have a grease interceptor. 
(2)  All users. Each user shall register its grease recovery system with the Village of Lemont. Each user shall maintain and possess a valid discharge permit issued by the Village of Lemont. 
(3)  Discharge permits. A discharge permit, required for each FOG producing facility, shall be valid for a one-year period following the date of issuance. Renewal of a discharge permit shall be in accordance with a registration application provided by the Village of Lemont. Each user shall keep and maintain a valid, current discharge permit issued by the village as one of the documents in the manifest/maintenance log required to be kept on the FOG producing facility premises. 
(d)  Grease trap disposal. 
(1)  Licensed contractor required . A licensed professional hauler must empty the grease traps and dispose of the sludge in an environmentally safe manor. This shall be done on a monthly basis unless the Village of Lemont, upon receipt of proof from the owner or operator or on the basis of its own inspection of the grease trap, determines that a less or more frequent maintenance schedule is required to achieve the purpose of this amendment and to prevent the discharge of fats, oils, and grease into the Village of Lemont sewer system. The establishment must keep a manifest of the cleaning and emptying of the grease trap. This manifest will be kept on site and made available to village officials. 
(2)  No pump-and-return methodology. A contractor shall not use a pump and return methodology to service grease traps or interceptors. 
(3)  No biological or chemical treatment agents. The use of biological or chemical agents that dissolve grease to permit it to be discharged into the sanitary sewer system is not permitted. 
(e)  Maintenance records. 
(1)  Maintenance records required . Each user, at each FOG producing facility, shall maintain an accurate record of all cleaning(s) or maintenance of its FOG producing facility grease recovery system. The following records shall be kept on site at the FOG producing facility for a minimum two-year period. 
a.  Haulers . The hauler shall provide the facility manager, at the time of service, a manifest conforming to all state statutes and regulations and the provisions of this section. 
b.  Manifest . The removal of grease recovery system contents shall be recorded on a manifest that identifies the pumping, hauling and disposal of the wastes, and whether collected from an interior or an exterior grease recovery system. 
c.  Manifest/maintenance log. The owner(s) of each FOG producing facility shall maintain and keep available on the premises a continuous log of manifests (and other similar records) regarding each cleaning or maintenance of the grease recovery system for the previous 24 months. The log shall be kept on the FOG producing facility premises in a location where the log is available for inspection or review by the Village official. 
(f)  Violation . 
(1)  Any person or user who violates any provision or section of this ordinance, or who violates any determination or order of the Village of Lemont under this ordinance, shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
(2)  In addition to subsection (f)(1) above, any sewer or manhole overflow, or sewer back-up, resulting from (a) violation(s) of any provision or subsection of this section, or an inadequately operating grease recovery system, or lack of an approved grease recovery system, shall result in the imposition of a service charge to the responsible owner(s) or user(s). The service charge shall include the cost(s) of cleaning the blockage out of the adjacent wastewater collection system. Imposition of (a) service charge(s) under this section shall not preclude other enforcement action(s).

2.  Upon meeting, the Technical Review Committee shall provide comment on the application to the petitioner, and these comments shall be forwarded by the Planning and Economic Development Director to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
3.  As soon as possible after the review by the Technical Review Committee and after submittal of a complete application, the preliminary plat application shall be placed on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation. Based upon comments from the Technical Review Committee (e.g., errors on the plat of survey), the Planning and Economic Development Director may delay placement of the application on the Planning and Zoning Commission's agenda until the comments are addressed by the applicant. 
4.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the application and staff comments. In recommending approval of the preliminary plat application, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the following: 
a.  The proposed subdivision's design in relation to the layout of lots, outlots, access, street network, length of any cul-de-sacs, and open space; and 
b.  The proposed subdivision's impact on traffic, storm water management, and applicable standards of this ordinance. 
c.  The proposed subdivision's compliance with the Village's comprehensive plan. 
d.  Comment from other governmental bodies or the public. 
5.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make a recommendation on the application to the Village Board. Findings of fact shall be included with the recommendation. Additionally, five copies of the plat for processing and signature shall be forwarded with the application and recommendation. The Village Board shall review the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation and findings, and following such review may approve, deny, or approve with modification the preliminary plat. 
6.  (deleted, Ord O-54-09) 
C.  Final Plat Requirements. Final Plat applications shall be submitted to the Community Development Department on forms available from the department. The application shall be submitted in-person. A check-in of all documents required in the Final Plat stage of the approval process may occur at one time or separately. Final Plat applications shall include:

No final plat application shall be forwarded for review and approval unless it includes the required certificates. (See Appendix D for final plat certificates.) The final plan/plat shall be in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan/plat, i.e., the number of dwelling units has not been increased, height of buildings has not been increased, building materials are the same or of equal quality, and the general quantities and quality of the landscaping material is the same, and any changes to the final engineering plans do not alter the general design characteristics of the preliminary plan/plat. 
1.  The application for final plat shall be made to the Planning and Economic Development Director, who upon confirmation of the application's completeness, shall forward the application to the Village Engineer for review. The application for final plat shall not be considered complete until all appropriate certificates and signatures from non-Village officials have been affixed. 
2.  Upon satisfactory review by the Village Engineer, the Planning and Economic Development Director shall place the application on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation and findings. 
3.  The Village Board shall review the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation and findings, and following such review may approve, deny, or approve with modification the final plat.

17.04.140. - SPECIAL USES. 
A.  Purpose. The formulation and enactment of this ordinance is based on the division of the Village into zoning districts within which the use of land and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. While certain uses may be necessary or desirable within a given district, these certain uses, because of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation. Such uses are classified as "special uses." Case-by-case review of special uses is intended to ensure consideration of the particular special use's anticipated land use, site design, and impacts. 
B.  Public Hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on all special use applications except as otherwise noted in this ordinance. The provisions for the conduct and notice of public hearings in this ordinance shall apply (see § 17.04.050 of this ordinance). 
C.  Standards for a Special Use. No special use shall be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless the special use: 
1.  Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location; and 
2.  Is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated that the public health, safety, and welfare will be protected; and 
3.  Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is located; and 
4.  Shall not create excessive demands on Village service or impair the ability of the Village to maintain the peace and provide adequate protection for its citizens; and 
5.  Is consistent with standards enumerated elsewhere in this ordinance for the specific use, including planned unit developments. 
6.  Meets, as applicable, the standards for planned unit developments found in Chapter 17.08 of this ordinance. 
D.  Conditions for Special Use Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village Board may provide such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location, and operation of a special use as may be deemed necessary to promote the objectives of this ordinance or mitigate potential adverse impacts of the special use. In the event that the Planning and Zoning Commission does not recommend approval of the special use, a favorable vote of two-thirds of all the Trustees of the Village Board then holding office shall be required for the approval of the special use. 
E.  Lapse of Special Use Approval. Under certain circumstances special use approval may become null and void. In such cases, reinstatement or re-establishment of the special use will require approval pursuant to the provisions of this section. Unless otherwise stated in the ordinance approving the special use, approval of a special use shall become null and void in the event of the following: 
1.  A complete building permit application has not been received by the Village for construction, installation, or relocation within one year after the effective date of the ordinance granting the special use; or 
2.  A building permit has been issued within one year of the effective date of the special use, but such construction, installation, or relocation has not commenced within one year after the issuance of the building permit; 
3.  The special use is discontinued for a period of six months. 
F.  Change to an Approved Special Use. A change in the intensity of use of an existing special use, or a change to the conditions of approval of a special use shall be deemed the same as a new special use and shall require approval pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.04.140; Ord. No. O-34-16, § 3, 10-24-2016) 
17.04.150. - VARIATIONS. 
A.  Intent. A variation is a grant of relief to a property owner from the requirements of this Unified Development Ordinance where literal adherence would cause undue hardship. Additionally, a variation is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this ordinance would render the land difficult to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variation is requested. A variation is not intended merely to remove an inconvenience or financial burden that the requirements of this ordinance may impose. A variation is not intended to allow the establishment of a use that is otherwise prohibited in a zoning district or that would change the zoning district classification, and a variation should not be granted where a special use approval or amendment to the Unified Development Ordinance would be more appropriate. 
B.  Public Hearing for Variations. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on variation requests. Under certain conditions, the Zoning Hearing Officer may conduct public hearings for variation requests-see paragraph C of this section. The provisions of this section on the conduct and notice of public hearings shall apply (see § 17.04.050 of this ordinance). 
C.  Zoning Hearing Officer's Authority. 
1.  The Zoning Hearing Officer may conduct public hearings on the following variation requests and recommend to the Village Board either approval or denial of the requests. This authority to conduct public hearings and make recommendations is limited to the following: 
a.  A variation request to reduce off-street parking or off-street loading requirements for non-residential uses by not more than 20%; and 
b.  A variation request to increase the floor area ratio by not more than five percent; and 
c.  A variation request to decrease the setback of a primary structure by not more than 20%; and 
d.  A variation request to decrease the setback of an accessory structure or obstruction in a required yard by not more than 20%; and 
e.  A variation request to increase the building height by not more than 10%. 
2.  Prior to the public hearing and public notice, and at the Zoning Hearing Officer's discretion, any variation request may be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission for fulfillment of the public hearing and recommendation requirements. 
3.  Within 30 days upon the conclusion of a public hearing by the Zoning Hearing Officer, he or she shall recommend to the Village Board approval or denial of the variation request. The Zoning Hearing Officer shall include findings of fact with the recommendations. 
D.  Standards for Variations. 
1.  Neither the Planning and Zoning Commission nor the Zoning Hearing Officer shall recommend a variation from the regulations of this ordinance unless the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Zoning Hearing Officer makes findings of fact based upon the evidence presented in each specific case that: 
a.  The variation is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Unified Development Ordinance; and 
b.  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and thus strict enforcement of the Unified Development Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or impose exceptional hardships due to the special and unusual conditions that are not generally found on other properties in the same zoning district; and 
c.  The variation will not alter the essential character of the locality and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property. (Ordinance No. O-36-08, 2008) 
2.  In making a determination whether there are unique circumstances, practical difficulties, or particular hardships, the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Zoning Hearing Officer shall take into consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by the evidence: 
a.  The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved results in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations of this Unified Development Ordinance were fulfilled; and 
b.  The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; and 
c.  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; and 
d.  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located; and 
e.  The variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent properties, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
3.  The Planning and Zoning Commission or the Zoning Hearing Officer may recommend and the Village Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon the subject property as may be necessary to comply with the intent and standards as set forth in this section. In the event that the Planning and Zoning Commission does not recommend approval of the variation, a favorable vote of two-thirds of all the Trustees of the Village Board shall be required for the approval of the variation. In the event that either the Zoning Hearing Officer does not recommend approval of the variation, a simple majority of the Village Board shall be required for the approval of the variation. 
E.  Lapse of Variation. Under certain circumstances approval of a variation may become null and void. In such cases, reinstatement or re-establishment of the variation will require approval pursuant to the provisions of this section. A variation shall lapse in the event of the following: 
1.  A building permit has not been issued by the Village for such construction, installation, or relocation within one year after the effective date of the ordinance granting the variation; or 
2.  A building permit has been issued, but such construction, installation, or relocation has not been initiated within one year after the effective date of the ordinance granting said variation; or 
3.  If construction, installation, or relocation has been initiated but not been completed, and two years have passed since the issuance of the building permit, and the applicant is not diligently pursuing the completion of the construction, installation, or relocation.

17.04.170. - APPEALS. 
A.  Right to Appeal. An appeal to the Planning and Zoning Commission may be taken by any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official charged with the enforcement of this ordinance. 
B.  Procedure for Appeals. The appeal shall be filed, in writing with the Planning and Economic Development Director within 45 days of the action complained of by filing. The Planning and Economic Development Director shall transmit all documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken to the Planning and Zoning Commission for processing in accordance with the Illinois Compiled Statutes as amended.

For each proposed amendment, the Planning and Economic Development Director shall forward a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or Village Board prior to the public hearing. Public hearings before the Planning and Zoning Commission or other commission shall be conducted in accordance with § 17.04.040 of this ordinance.

ARTICLE II. - ZONING ("Zoning Ordinance") 
CHAPTER 17.05. - ZONING DISTRICTS 

17.05.010. - ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSES OF DISTRICTS. 
    In order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this ordinance, the Village of Lemont is hereby divided into the following districts: 
A.  Residential Districts. The residential districts ("R districts") are primarily for residential land uses and for other selected uses that are deemed compatible with residential environments. The R districts are intended to maintain and promote a variety of housing types within the Village. 
1.  R-1 Single-Family Detached Residential District. This district is intended to provide very low density areas for relatively large single-family detached homes on lot sizes of three acres or more. 
2.  R-2 Single-Family Detached Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas of very low density and low density, with single-family detached dwellings on lot sizes of 40,000 square feet or more. 
3.  R-3 Single-Family Detached Residential District. This district is intended to provide areas for low-density, single-family detached dwellings on lot sizes between 20,000 and 40,000 square feet. 
4.  R-4 Single-Family Detached Residential District. This district is intended to provide regulations for both some of the older established areas of the Village and the majority of newer areas annexed into the Village, and to provide areas for low- and medium-density, single-family detached dwellings on lot sizes of 12,500 square feet or more. 
5.  R-4A Single-Family Preservation and Infill District. This district is intended to regulate the height, building coverage, and impervious surface coverage of residential dwelling units in the older established neighborhoods of the Village. Specifically, the district's restrictions are intended to prevent the overcrowding of land, ensure proper living conditions, assure the adequate provision of light, air and open spaces, and to foster and preserve the nature, character, and quality of existing neighborhoods, while providing property owners opportunities for infill development on vacant lots or redevelopment of lots with existing structures. In particular this district is intended to prevent the further proliferation of structures that do not conform to the general height, bulk, and scale of existing structures. 
6.  R-5 Single-Family Attached Residential District. This district is intended to provide medium-density areas for single-family attached dwellings, i.e. duplexes, two-family detached dwellings, and town homes. 
7.  R-6 Multi-Family Residential District. This district is intended to provide medium- and high-density areas for single-family attached and multi-family dwellings: duplexes, two-family detached dwellings, town homes, apartment buildings and condominium buildings. 
B.  Business Districts. The various business districts ("B districts) are intended to maintain and promote a variety of commercial activity within the Village. The district formerly known as B-2 Historic Central Business District has been superseded by the downtown district, and the provisions for this district have been placed in a separate chapter of this ordinance-see chapter 17.09. 
1.  B-1 Office/Retail Transitional District. This district is intended to provide an environment suitable for retail, service, and office establishments. The intensity of the uses is less than the B-3, and site layout is less oriented toward the automobile than the B-3. 
2.  B-3 Arterial Commercial District. This district is intended to accommodate a wide range of retail, service, and commercial uses where patrons arrive by vehicle rather than other modes of transportation. This district is meant for the highest intensities of commercial use. 
3.  B-4 Commercial Recreation. The B-4 regulations are intended to provide for the orderly, compatible development of land and the maximum recreational potential of the land. 
C.  Manufacturing Districts. The manufacturing districts ("M districts") are designed to provide for the establishment of a full range of industrial and allied activities, and to mitigate any negative effects of these activities on other land uses. 
1.  M-1 Light Manufacturing District. This district is intended to provide an environment suitable for industrial activities that require a pleasant and nuisance-free environment and be compatible with adjacent land uses. Additionally, the M-1 district is intended to provide an environment suitable for certain office and research activities that do not create appreciable nuisances or hazards. This district may be located adjacent to R districts, and thus its provisions include special yard setbacks and screening requirements. 
2.  M-2 General Manufacturing District. This district is designed to accommodate those industrial activities that have moderate land use intensity and are located in areas relatively remote from residential and prime retail development. 
3.  M-3 Heavy Manufacturing District. This district is designed to accommodate relatively large, self-contained and isolated areas intended to be used for industrial activities having potentially moderate to high land use intensity. 
4.  M-4 Mineral Extraction District. This district is designed to regulate the conservation, development, management and appropriate use of all the natural resources of such areas for compatible multiple purposes, and protecting the health, safety and general welfare of the people, as well as the natural beauty and aesthetic values, in the affected areas. Within the Township there are many valuable mineral deposits that must be protected against the premature encroachment of urban development. These natural resources, including deposits of sand, gravel, stone, clay, coal, and other minerals represent an important consideration in the economic and physical development of the Township. Because of the unique aspects involved, in the mineral operations and the potential reuse of the land once the minerals are extracted, a separate zoning classification is established. 
D.  Other Districts. 
1.  DD Downtown District. The downtown district ("DD district") is established to promote a compatible mixture of commercial, cultural, institutional, governmental, and residential uses in a compact, pedestrian-oriented, traditional village center consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and other documents, such as the Downtown Master Plan, that the Village may adopt from time to time. Additionally, the DD district is intended to maintain and enhance the historic, community, architectural, and aesthetic qualities unique to the downtown area. 
2.  INT Institutional District. The institutional district ("INT district") is designed to provide an environment for land uses of a civic, educational, governmental, recreational, and religious nature. It is also intended to provide an environment for institutional group living. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.05.010) 
17.05.020. - THE ZONING MAP. 
A.  Adoption. The locations and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Zoning Ordinance are shown on the Village of Lemont Zoning Map ("the Zoning Map"), which-together with all notations, references and other information shown on the map-is hereby adopted and incorporated into this Zoning Ordinance. 
B.  Maintenance. The Village of Lemont Zoning Map is maintained by the Planning and Economic Development Director. In case of any dispute regarding the zoning classification of any property subject to this ordinance, the Zoning Map maintained by the Planning and Economic Development Director governs. 
C.  Zoning District Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to boundaries of the various zoning districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules apply: 
1.  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as following streets, alleys, railroad right-of-ways, bodies of water or extensions thereof, such boundary lines are to be construed as centerlines of the streets, alleys, railroad right-of-ways, bodies of water or extensions. 
2.  Unless otherwise dimensioned, boundaries are construed to follow lot lines. 
3.  Streets, alleys, or other public right-of-ways that have been vacated will be construed to fall in the same zoning district as the lots abutting both sides of the street, alley or right-of-way involved. If the lots abutting each side of the street, alley or right-of-way were classified in different zoning districts before the vacation, the centerline of the street, alley, or right-of-way shall be construed as the boundary between the zoning districts.

State Law reference- Publication of official zoning map 65 ILCS 5/11-13-19. 
17.05.030. - ZONING OF ANNEXED AND UNCLASSIFIED LANDS. 
    Unless otherwise provided for in an annexation agreement, all land annexed to the Village shall automatically be classified in the R-1 district. In the event the zoning classification of any land within the Village corporate limits is not depicted on the Zoning Map, such land shall be considered zoned as R-1. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.05.030) 
CHAPTER 17.06. - USE REGULATIONS 

17.06.010. - USES OF LAND. 
A.  Existing Uses. 
1.  No building, structure, or use not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this ordinance. 
2.  When a use classified as a special use under this ordinance exists as a special use on the effective date of this ordinance, such use will be considered a legal special use except as otherwise expressly provided in this section. 
3.  When any amendment to this ordinance changes the classification of a permitted use to a special use, any use legally established before such amendment will be considered a special use after the effective date of such amendment.

B.  Special Uses. An "S" in Table 17-06-01 indicates that the use is reviewed and approved in accordance with the "special use" procedures of this ordinance. See § 17.04.140 for these procedures. Special uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this ordinance. 
C.  Prohibited Uses. A blank cell or a cell with a "-" in Table 17-06-01 indicates that the use is not allowed in the zoning district. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.06.020) 
17.06.030. - ACCESSORY USES. 
A.  Accessory Use Table. Table 17-06-02 of this chapter contains the standards for permitted obstructions and accessory uses in various yards. All accessory buildings, structures, and uses shall comply with the height limits of the zoning district in which they are located unless otherwise provided for in this table. Accessory uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this ordinance. 
B.  Compatibility and Date of Establishment. Accessory buildings, structures, and uses shall be compatible with the principal use and shall not be established or erected prior to the establishment or construction of the principal use. 
C.  Keeping of Animals. Except as permitted in this ordinance, accessory structures shall not be used for the keeping of livestock, horses, poultry, rabbits, exotic animals and/or the breeding of animals whether or not for profit unless: 
1.  The lot area is at least one acre; and 
2.  The structure is located at least 150 feet from the side and rear lot lines; and 
3.  The structure is located at least 200 feet from any residence on another lot; and 
4.  The number of livestock is limited to one per 20,000 square feet of lot area. 
D.  Location. The location of accessory structures shall be governed by: 
1.  Table 17-06-02; 
2.  Paragraph E of this section; and 
3.  Section 17.07.020 of this ordinance, which covers standards for the R-4A district, and Chapter 17.09 of this ordinance, which covers standards for the DD district. 
E.  Detached Garages and Sheds. 
1.  In R districts, detached garages and sheds shall be accessory uses only; they shall not be constructed prior to the establishment of a permitted principal use on the lot. 
2.  Detached garages and sheds shall be built at least three feet from all lot lines, unless specifically allowed otherwise by this ordinance. Additionally, detached garages and sheds shall be at least 10 feet from the principal structure unless the detached garage or shed meets or exceeds the Village building code standards for attached garages concerning fire protection rating, footing, and foundation. 
3.  Detached garages and sheds in R districts and detached garages and sheds that are accessory to residential uses shall have a maximum height of 15 feet. Parking structures in the Downtown District are subject to the height limits of the zoning district. Detached garages and sheds in all other districts shall have a maximum height of 30 feet. 
4.  In R-districts detached garages shall not be established on lots where an attached garage already exists. Similarly, attached garages shall not be established where a detached garage already exists. Only one detached garage shall be allowed per zoning lot, and the area of a detached garage shall not exceed 660 square feet. 
F.  Public Art. The Village of Lemont Art & Culture Commission may, pursuant to approval by the Village Board, place public art on property so long as: 
1.  Neither the work of art itself nor its particular placement on a site interferes with traffic or pedestrian safety; and 
2.  The height of the public art complies with the height limits for structures in the zoning district in which the public art is placed; and 
3.  The property owner has granted consent. 
G.  Dumpster Enclosures Required. 
1.  All dumpsters for solid waste shall be stored within an enclosure of sufficient size, five to six feet in height, to completely screen such dumpsters from view. When the enclosure is designed to serve a new or reconstructed principal building, the enclosure shall be constructed of wood or masonry using materials, colors and patterns similar to the exterior of the principal building. Enclosures shall not be constructed of chain link. 
2.  Certain lots within the Village, in particular lots in the downtown area, may lack sufficient space for such enclosures. In cases where there are unique circumstances that make the installation impractical, including but not limited to the lack of usable area on the zoning lot, the Planning and Economic Development Director may grant a waiver of the requirement upon receipt of the owner's written request and explanation of the particular hardship. Prior to the granting of such a waiver, the Planning and Economic Development Director shall determine that all reasonably feasible measures have been taken to mitigate any negative impacts caused by the placement of dumpsters, recycling bins, containers or any other solid waste receptacles. 
H.  Lot Coverage. The combined square footage of all accessory structures, driveways, sidewalks, to include the surface area of swimming pools and all types of pavers or paving brick, or other areas with an impervious surface shall not exceed 36 percent of the area of a required front or rear setback except:

E.  Permitting. The Village may, from time to time and as it sees appropriate, impose permitting requirements on model homes. The Village's grading, landscaping, and building requirements for residential construction shall apply. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.06.070) 
17.06.080. - HOME OCCUPATIONS.

F.  Prohibited Activities. The following activities are expressly prohibited as home occupations: 
1.  Animal hospitals (animal grooming services are permitted); 
2.  Kennels; 
3.  Medical and dental clinics;

17.06.110. - ADULT USES. 
    Based on experiences and studies prepared by numerous municipalities and organizations, the Village has determined that adult uses have adverse secondary effects, impact on crime, property values, and neighborhood quality. Said studies include: Report To: The American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses, Peter R. Hecht (1996); Effects of Adult Entertainment Businesses on Residential Neighborhoods, City of El Paso (1986); NLC Summaries of "SOB Land Use" Studies: Crime Impact Studies By Municipal and State Governments on Harmful Secondary Effects of Sexually Oriented Businesses, National Law Center for Children and Families (2000). In a desire to minimize such harmful secondary effects, the Village finds it desirable to regulate adult uses while maintaining reasonably available options for their location within the Village. Therefore, adult uses shall be regulated as follows: 
A.  Location Restrictions. An Adult use shall be permitted only within the M-4 district provided that the adult use is: 
1.  Not within 1,000 feet of a property boundary of any school, day care center, cemetery, public park, forest preserve, public housing, and place of public worship; and 
2.  Not within 500 feet of the boundary of any parcel in the DD district. 
B.  Method of Measurement. Measurement of the location restrictions described in paragraph A of this section shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest lot line of the lot where the adult use is to be located, to the nearest lot line of the other specified use. 
C.  Exterior Display. No adult use shall be conducted in any manner that permits the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas from any other property, public or private. This provision shall apply to any display, sign, window or other opening. All entries, windows or other openings for adult uses shall be covered or screened in a manner that prevents a view into the interior from any public way.

D.  Lot Consolidations in the R-4A District. Lot consolidations shall not result in a lot that has a lot area exceeding 12,500 square feet. 
E.  Maximum Floor Area Allowance. Each primary structure within the R-4A shall conform to a maximum floor area allowance. The maximum floor area allowance is determined as follows: 
Lot area square footage × 0.16 + 1,600 = Maximum floor area 
    See the definition of "floor area" in Chapter 17.02 of this ordinance for additional guidance on computing the maximum floor area allowance. 
F.  Garages and Other Accessory Structures in the R-4A District. If the provisions of this paragraph F conflict with other paragraphs of this ordinance, this paragraph shall govern. The following provisions apply: 
1.  For attached garages, the total width of all garage doors shall not exceed 22 feet or 58% of the dwelling's street-side elevation, whichever is less. 
2.  If an existing alley provides access to the lot in question, then detached and attached garages shall be accessed from the alley. 
3.  Detached garage height shall not exceed a midpoint height of 15 feet and shall not exceed a peak height of 20 feet. 
4.  Accessory buildings including detached garages shall not have a combined total area that exceeds 10% of the lot area. 
5.  Detached garages shall be at least seven feet from the principal structure. 
6.  Detached garages shall be at least three feet from the rear property line and at least three feet from all side property lines. 
7.  The area of attached garages shall not exceed 10% of the lot area.

Transition yards shall meet the following requirements: 
A.  Depth. Transition yards shall have a minimum depth of 12 feet. 
B.  Screening. Screening shall be provided in accordance with the landscape standards of § 17.20.060. In instances where a drainage or utility easement is conterminous with the transition yard and make the required screening requirements difficult to fulfill, the width of the transition yard shall be increased so it does not compromise the function of the utility or drainage easement. 
C.  Use. The transition yard shall not be used for parking, loading, servicing, or storage. 
D.  Exceptions. In cases where a lot adjacent to a lot B-, INT- or M-zoned lot is re-zoned to residential or annexed to the Village, such B-, INT- or M-zoned lots are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph until such time that a site development permit is required for changes to such B-, INT-, or M-zoned lots.

CHAPTER 17.08. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 

17.08.010. - PURPOSE. 
A.  Background. A planned unit development (PUD) is generally intended for a project incorporating a single type of use or a variety of related and complementary uses which is planned and developed as a unit. Such development may provide for a wide range of development techniques and ownership methods. The entire development shall be controlled by means of an ordinance granting the planned unit development as a special use. Within the framework of a PUD normal zoning standards may be modified. The resulting flexibility is intended to encourage a development that is more environmentally sensitive, economically viable, and aesthetically pleasing than might otherwise be possible under strict adherence to the underlying zoning district's standards. 
B.  Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan is a non-binding policy statement on future development within and near the Village. While adherence to the Comprehensive Plan is not mandatory, PUDs should nevertheless remain in substantial compliance with the densities, land use policies, and other aspects of development outlined in the Comprehensive Plan. Each proposal for a PUD shall be presented and judged on its own merits, and approval shall not be based exclusively on a comparison to an already existing PUD. 
C.  Objectives. Specific objectives shall be achieved, where applicable, through the planned unit development procedure. These specific objectives are: 
1.  To ensure that the future growth and development which occurs is in accordance with policies and goals of the Village; and 
2.  To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving and integrating the natural environmental and landscape features of the property into land development; and 
3.  To stimulate creative approaches to the residential, commercial, and industrial development of land; and 
4.  To encourage and stimulate economic development within the Village; and 
5.  To preserve or enhance natural features of the site; and 
6.  To provide usable open space areas within a reasonable distance of all dwelling units; and 
7.  To facilitate, in a cost effective manner, the development and maintenance of adequate public services; and 
8.  To encourage patterns of and use that decrease trip lengths and increase the use of modes of transportation other than private vehicle; and 
9.  To reduce energy demand and consumption; and 
10.  To encourage the introduction of related and complementary land uses; and 
11.  To allow a clustering of residential uses on smaller lots to conserve or create open space. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.010) 
17.08.020. - THRESHOLDS. 
A.  Mandatory. Development of land that includes more than one type of land use on a single zoning lot shall be approved as a PUD. Additionally, all development that meets one or more of the following shall be approved as a PUD: 
1.  Development of land totaling 20 or more acres; or 
2.  Development of land including 40 or more dwelling units. 
3.  Development of land including more than one principal building on the lot of record. 
B.  Elective. Any owner of property who wishes to develop his or her property as a PUD may voluntarily petition for such approval under the provisions of this ordinance. 
C.  Exempt Development. Development of land within the DD district has unique thresholds for PUDs, and therefore the mandatory provisions of paragraph A of this section do not apply to development within the DD district; see Chapter 17.09 of this ordinance for development in the DD district. 
D.  Review of Commercial Projects. All commercial projects, whether PUDs or not, are subject to the commercial design standards of Chapter 17.21 of this ordinance. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.020) 
17.08.030. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. 
    In recommending or granting approval of PUDs, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Village Board of Trustees shall ensure that the proposed PUD meets the following standards: 
A.  Ownership. The land intended for the PUD shall be under single ownership and/or unified control at the time of filing the application. 
B.  Public Improvements. All public improvements shall be constructed in accordance with existing ordinances and regulations of the Village. All internal roadways shall be built to public standards following public procurement procedures and dedicated to the Village as public roadways unless otherwise approved by the Village Board. 
C.  Land Designations. PUDs containing dwelling units shall provide for the dedication or reservation of land for common open space, parks, schools, or cash payment in lieu of actual and dedication, or a combination of land and cash in accordance with the Village Code. 
D.  Open Space Requirement. Each PUD not located in the DD district and with a residential component should consist of at least 15% open space. This open space is intended to be in addition to land designated to fulfill the requirements of paragraph C of this section shall meet the following standards: 
1.  For trails, the open space width shall be a minimum of 20 feet. 
2.  Each area must be accessible to all the residents of the proposed PUD. Sidewalks, bike trails, or pedestrian paths must link separate open space areas. 
3.  Land dedicated to the Lemont Park District may be included in the calculation of open space. 
4.  Open space shall not include: 
a.  Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual tenant or owner; and 
b.  Dedicated streets and alleys; and 
c.  Required detention/retention areas, floodplains, floodways, or wetlands, unless the Village Board determines that natural features, such as a creek or grove of trees will be a substantial amenity for the development; and 
d.  Irregular or narrow strips of land less than 30 feet wide, unless containing a trail for bicycles or pedestrians; and 
e.  Existing permanent utility casements. 
D.  Open space ownership and maintenance. The public or private ownership for all open space and its maintenance shall be proposed by the developer and approved as part of the ordinance authorizing the PUD. All open space should be platted as separate outlots. Restrictive covenants running with the land shall guarantee that open space shall be properly cared for and used only for the purposes designated in the PUD's approving ordinance. The developer shall submit a plan describing the method and schedule of maintenance. 
E.  Special Service Area. A special service area may be required to ensure adequate property maintenance. This special service area shall be created at the time of annexation (or final platting of the first phase of the PUD if annexation is not necessary), and shall include all phases of the PUD. In the event the entity that has ownership and maintenance responsibilities fails to adequately manage the open space, the Village may assume maintenance responsibilities until such time as that or another appropriate entity can manage the open space. The Village may tax the property of those within the special service area for the Village's prior and estimated future costs of maintaining the open space. 
F.  Timing of Improvements. 
1.  Construction of recreational facilities, and other improvements to open spaces, e.g., parks and trails, serving the PUD shall commence and be completed in accordance with the approved PUD ordinance. At a minimum, such improvements shall commence prior to the completion of not more than 20% of the dwelling units in the development or prior to the completion of the first 50 dwelling units, whichever comes first. For this provision, issuance of a certificate of occupancy, including temporary certificates, shall be deemed "completion" of a dwelling unit. 
2.  Recreation facilities and other improvements to open spaces shall be completed prior to the issuance of building permits for the last 25% of the dwelling units. 
3.  In PUDs with two or more phases, construction of recreational facilities and other improvements to open space shall be completed prior to the issuance of building permits for the next phase. 
G.  Development Standards. PUDs shall adhere to the development standards contained in Article IV of this ordinance. 
H.  Additional Conditions. To meet the unique circumstances presented by each PUD, and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of existing Village residents and the future residents and users of the proposed development, the Village Board may attach any other condition it deems necessary, but not specifically provided for in this ordinance, to the approval of the PUD. Such conditions may include more stringent requirements for construction, design, materials, phasing, and revocation. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.030) 
17.08.040. - PERMITTED DEVIATIONS FROM VILLAGE ORDINANCES. 
    Except as specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, planned unit developments shall be developed in conformity with this Unified Development Ordinance. Modifications that deviate from the bulk, density, and design provisions of this ordinance are privileges and will be considered by the Village only in direct response to tangible community benefits received from the PUD. These benefits shall be in the form of exceptional amenities, such as outstanding architecture, the design and amount of open space, the quantity and quality of landscaping, sensitivity to existing topography or drainage, preservation of existing mature trees of exceptional quality, or other similar traits. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.040) 
17.08.050. - PUD APPROVAL PROCESS. 
    A PUD shall be granted as a special use to the zoning district in which it is located. The Village Board is the final decision-making body. PUDs shall be processed, reviewed and approved in three steps: pre-application review by the Technical Review Committee, PUD preliminary plan/plat, and PUD final plan/plat. The preliminary plan/plat and the final plan/plat may be filed and approved simultaneously provided all public hearing requirements are met. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.050) 
17.08.060. - PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW. 
A.  Submission and Distribution of Plans. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a PUD, the developer shall request on forms available from the Community Development Department a concept plan review by the Technical Review Committee (TRC). Upon receipt of a complete application for TRC review, the Community Development Department shall distribute copies of the application to the TRC members and schedule a meeting of the TRC. Unless agreed upon by the applicant, this meeting shall be no later than 45 days after submission of the complete application. At a minimum, the application for concept plan review shall include: 
1.  Map showing the location of the proposed development and surrounding land uses; and 
2.  Concept site plan showing locations of streets, buildings, and any subdivision of land; and 
3.  Information regarding site topography, drainage, and intentions for storm water management and extension/hook-up of water and sewer lines and utilities. 
4.  A concept landscape plan depicting location of existing vegetation and general location and type of intended landscaping. 
5.  Building elevations with proposed materials. 
B.  Technical Review Committee Meeting. The TRC is advisory only. Nothing offered or said by the Village staff or TRC members shall be construed as an approval of the project or approval of any particular element of the project. All advice and recommendations are subject to modification during later stages of the approval process. The purposes of the TRC meeting are to help the applicant determine whether: 
1.  The concept plan appears to be in conformity with the land-use policies and objectives of the Village; and 
2.  The concept plan appears to be in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and all other applicable Village standards; and 
3.  Any other governmental body has objections or suggestions concerning the proposal. 
C.  Post-Meeting Report. Each member of the TRC will be given an opportunity to present recommendations on the concept plan, and the Planning and Economic Development Director shall provide a written report to the applicant containing a summary of the TRC members' recommendations. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.060; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012) 
17.08.070. - PUD PRELIMINARY PLAN/PLAT. 
A.  Overview. Upon completion of the pre-application stage of the PUD process, the applicant shall prepare and submit a preliminary plan/plat for the proposed development. The purpose of the PUD preliminary plan/plat is for the applicant to obtain preliminary approval by the Village Board that the intended development is acceptable and that the applicant can reasonably proceed with the preparation of detailed site, architecture, engineering, and landscaping plans. 
B.  Pre-Hearing Actions. 
1.  The applicant shall submit an application for PUD preliminary plan/plat approval for the proposed development. The PUD preliminary plan/plat shall be processed concurrently with any required annexation, annexation agreements, Zoning Map amendments, or variation approvals. All PUD preliminary plan/plats shall require review and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission except for those PUDs located entirely or partially within the DD District, which shall be reviewed directly by the Village Board. 
2.  The Planning and Economic Development Director shall review each PUD preliminary plan/plat application for completeness and, if the application is complete, schedule a public hearing before the appropriate body. The hearing shall be no later than 90 days after the submission of a complete application unless the petitioner agrees otherwise. 
3.  Pubic notice for the hearing shall be posted in accordance with § 17.04.050 of this ordinance. 
4.  Prior to the scheduled public hearing the Planning and Economic Development Director shall review the PUD Preliminary plan/plat application for compliance with the objectives and adopted land use plans and the regulations of this ordinance and forward a report of the review with recommendations to the appropriate hearing body. 
C.  Public Hearings. The hearing body shall conduct a public hearing on the PUD preliminary plan/plat and shall preserve a record of the public hearing. 
1.  If the hearing is before the Planning and Zoning Commission, that body shall either recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the application. The recommendation shall be forwarded with findings of fact to the Village Board. The recommendation with findings shall be forwarded to the Village Board for consideration within 90 days of the conclusion of the public hearing, unless a delay is agreed upon by the petitioner. 
2.  If the hearing is before the Village Board, the Board shall, upon completion of the public hearing, direct the Community Development Department to prepare the appropriate ordinances and resolutions with suitable findings of fact. 
D.  Preliminary Plan/Plat Approval. The Village Board shall accept or reject the preliminary plan/plat within 60 days after its next regular meeting following the receipt of the written recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission, or, if the Village Board conducted the hearing, within 90 days of the conclusion of the hearing. The Village Board may require such special conditions in the approval of the preliminary plan/plat as it may deem necessary to insure conformity with the intent and goals of this ordinance. Upon approval by the Village Board a record shall be prepared including findings of fact and setting forth the terms of relief and/or variances granted from existing ordinances. 
E.  Effect of Approval. Once a PUD preliminary plan/plat is approved, applicants shall proceed to the final plan/plat stage of the development review and approval process. Approval of the PUD preliminary plan/plat shall not constitute approval of the final plan/plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of the approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plan or plans. 
F.  Lapse of Approval. A PUD preliminary plan/plat shall lapse and be of no further effect if a complete PUD final plan/plat application has not been submitted to the Community Development Department within 12 months of the date of the PUD preliminary plan/plat approval. The Village Board may, at its sole discretion, grant extensions of this 12-month period. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.070; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012; Ord. No. O-10-14, § 3, 2-10-2014) 
17.08.080. - PUD FINAL PLAN/PLAT. 
A.  Overview. Upon completion of the PUD preliminary plan/plat stage of the PUD process, the applicant shall prepare and submit a final plan/plat for the proposed development. The application for approval of the final development plan of a PUD may be submitted in phases. 
B.  PUD Final Plan/Plat Approval. Within one year of approval of the PUD Preliminary Plan/Plat, the applicant shall file for approval a PUD Final Plan/Plat covering all or part of the approved PUD Preliminary Plan/Plat. The PUD Final Plan/Plat shall be in substantial compliance with the PUD Preliminary Plan/Plat, i.e., the number of dwelling units has not been increased, the height of the buildings has not been increased, building materials are the same or of equal quality, and the general quantities and quality of the landscaping material is the same, and any changes to the final engineering do not alter the general design characteristics of the PUD Preliminary Plan/Plat. 
1.  The application for PUD Final Plan/Plat shall be made to the Planning and Economic Development Director, who upon confirmation of the application's completeness, shall forward it to other appropriate Village staff for review and comment. The Final Plan/Plat with staff comments shall be reviewed by the Planning & Zoning Commission. The Planning & Zoning Commission shall determine whether the PUD Final Plan/Plat is in substantial conformance with the PUD Preliminary Plan/Plat, and forward its determination to the Village Board. 
2.  The Village Board, upon receiving the determination from the Planning & Zoning Commission shall vote to either approve or disapprove the PUD Final Plan/Plat. (Ord. No. O-54-09) 
C.  Lapse of Approval. A PUD final plan/plat shall lapse and be of no further effect if site development does not commence with 12 months of the date of final plan/plat approval. The Village Board may, at its sole discretion, grant extensions of this 12-month period. 
D.  Recording of Plats. Recording of plats shall be accomplished in accordance with § 17.04.110 of this ordinance. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.080; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012) 
17.08.090. - CHANGES TO APPROVED PLANS/PLATS. 
    Changes to approved PUD final plans/plats may be modified only in accordance with the provisions of this section. Likewise, any change of a final plan/plat from an approved preliminary plan/plat shall be modified only in accordance with the provisions of this section. The requirements of this section are intended to ensure that significant changes to plans/plats do not occur without the opportunity for public input at a hearing. 
A.  Major Modification of Plans. Major modifications of plans shall require re-review and re-approval in accordance with the provisions of 17.08.070 of this ordinance. A "major modification" to an approved PUD plan/plat is any modification that meets any of the following thresholds: 
1.  Increases the number of dwelling units; or 
2.  Increases the height of any structure; or 
3.  Increases the non-residential floor area by more than 5%; or 
4.  Increases the impervious surface coverage by more than 2.5%; or 
5.  Decreases storm water detention or otherwise significantly alters the storm water management for the site; or 
6.  Reduces the amount of open space; or 
7.  Reduces the amount of landscaping plant material by more than 5%; or

A "minor modification" to an approved plan is any change that does not meet the thresholds in paragraph A of this section. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.08.090; Ord. No. O-41-10, § 12, 6-28-2010; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012; Ord. No. O-29-15, § 7, 9-14-2015) 
CHAPTER 17.09. - DOWNTOWN DISTRICT 

17.09.010. - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY. 
A.  Purpose. This chapter establishes standards for development and development approval in the downtown (DD) district. The DD district is established to promote a compatible mixture of commercial, cultural, institutional, governmental, and residential uses in a compact, pedestrian-oriented, traditional village center generally consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and other documents, such as the Downtown Master Plan, that the Village may adopt from time to time. Additionally, the DD district is intended to maintain and enhance the historic, community, architectural, and aesthetic qualities unique to the downtown area. Design objectives for development within the DD district are to enhance and produce a downtown with: 
1.  Generally rectilinear patterns of connected streets and blocks; and 
2.  Dwellings, shops, and workplaces generally located within close proximity to one another; and 
3.  Well configured open spaces and landscaped public areas woven into the pattern of the district and dedicated to collective social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment; and 
4.  A combination of on-street parking and centralized parking facilities and lots to collectively support commercial and residential uses within the district; and 
5.  Civil buildings that serve as landmarks, symbols, and activity centers for the community. 
B.  Applicability. All construction of new structures within the DD district shall be approved in accordance with this chapter. All major remodeling or reconstruction of an existing structure, except those structures used as a single-family residence, shall be approved in accordance with this chapter. Additionally, new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling may be subject to the provisions of Article III (Historic Preservation) of this ordinance. Major remodeling or reconstruction is: 
1.  A change in the height of a structure; or 
2.  A change in the footprint of a structure; or 
3.  A change in the materials used on the elevations; or 
4.  A change in the site layout (e.g., a reconfiguration of parking; a reduction in the amount or type of landscaping); or 
5.  Any other work beyond re-painting of exterior or interior, or work undertaken to maintain the structure in good repair (e.g., replacement of gutters, tuck pointing). 
(UDO 2008, § 17.09.010) 
17.09.020. - PRECEDENCE OF DD DISTRICT PROVISIONS. 
    If the provisions of this chapter conflict with provisions of other provisions of this ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.09.020) 
17.09.030. - LAND USES IN THE DD DISTRICT. 
    See Chapter 17.06 of this ordinance for regulations governing land uses within the DD district.

3.  The standards for the specific street types identified in § 17.09.090 and its attendant figures and tables. 
B.  Type I and Type II Approvals. There are two types of development review and approval procedures, Type I and Type II. Type I review and approval is for situations where the proposed size, height, or density and attendant potential impacts of the development on surrounding areas will be relatively minor. Type II review and approval is for situations where the proposed size, height, or density and attendant potential impacts of the development on surrounding areas is deemed much greater and therefore a discretionary review is warranted. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.09.040) 
17.09.050. - TYPE I REVIEW AND APPROVAL. 
A.  Type I Thresholds. New construction, or any remodeling or reconstruction of an existing which meets one or more of the following criteria shall be subject to Type I review and approval if: 
1.  It is to occur on lots not adjacent to the I&M Canal; or 
2.  It is to occur on lots less than 10,000 square feet; or 
3.  Fifteen or less dwelling units will be constructed; or 
4.  Less than 7,500 square feet of commercial gross floor area will be constructed. 
5.  The building will be less than three stories or less than 35 feet in height. 
B.  Applications. For Type I review and approval, applicants shall submit building permit applications to the Building Official for review. The standards for applications found in § 17.04.020 of this ordinance shall apply. 
C.  Administrative Review. The Building Official shall forward the application to the Planning and Economic Development Director, who shall review the application for completeness and adherence to the standards of this chapter.

17.09.090. - STREET TYPES. 
A.  General. In addition to the urban design standards and architectural standards found above, development under this chapter is regulated by street type. 
1.  The street type hierarchy is identified in Figure 17-09-01. Figure 17-09-02, the Regulating Plan, indicates the locations of the various street types. Tables 17-09-02 through 17-09-07 promulgate standards for the buildings located along the various street types. 
2.  When streets intersect, the street type highest in the hierarchy shall govern, and the facade of the building and its main entrance must face this street. 
3.  Where a street does not exist, the right of way shall be built to the cross-sectional requirements in the corresponding street type section. 
B.  Structures on Through Lots. Some lots extend between two parallel streets. If an applicant proposes more than one building on such a lot, then each building shall adhere to its corresponding street type requirements. If one building on the lot is proposed, then the street type requirements for each of the streets shall apply to the elevations facing the street, and each street-facing elevation shall be considered a facade. In such situations rear setbacks shall not apply. Changes in building height shall occur at or near the mid-point of the lot depth, but no closer than 50 feet from either of the two building frontages. All buildings, regardless of depth, shall have two facades, one facing each of the fronted streets.

1.  Allow for the preservation and adaptive re-use of existing buildings; and 
2.  Recognize the interests of landowners whose property and its uses were lawfully established; and 
3.  Place reasonable limits on nonconformities that have or potentially may have adverse effects on surrounding properties or the community. 
B.  Authority to Continue a Nonconforming. Any nonconformity that existed on the effective date of this ordinance or a situation that becomes a nonconformity upon adoption of any amendment to this zoning ordinance may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
C.  Continued Status of Nonconformity. Nonconforming status rests with the property, not with the property owner. Such status is not affected by changes in tenancy, or management. In certain instances, a change in ownership may affect the nonconforming status-see paragraph D of this section below. Additionally, a change in ownership shall result in the removal of all nonconforming signs. 
D.  Multi-Family Buildings. For a building that exists in a single-family zoning district but is nonconforming because they it is used as multi-family residential building, transfer of ownership shall result in an inspection by Village building code officials for basic health and safety violations. Upon satisfactory review by code officials, the Village shall issue an occupancy permit for the continued use of the building for multi-family residential use. Failure to bring the building into compliance with noted basic health and safety violations may result in the loss of the building's nonconforming status, and the building may then be subject to all actions, fines and penalties as described in § 17.01.070 of this ordinance. 
E.  Repairs and Maintenance. Nonconforming buildings and lots carry the same obligations and requirements for safe upkeep as conforming buildings and lots. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a nonconformity in compliance with the Village building codes are permitted unless otherwise expressly prohibited in this ordinance. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.13.010) 
17.13.020. - NONCONFORMING USES. 
A.  Change of a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may be converted to a use permitted in the subject zoning district. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
B.  Expansion of a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use, whether inside or outside of the building, may not be expanded beyond the area it occupies or increase in intensity at the time of the adoption of this section or any subsequent amendment. For example, a nonconforming multi-family building with three dwelling units in a single-family district could not add an additional unit. Likewise, a building that already exceeds the maximum height limit could not have its height increased. 
C.  Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use. 
1.  If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of six consecutive months it shall not be re-established, and any subsequent use of the property shall conform to the regulations of the subject zoning district. 
2.  Where the nonconforming use of land is accessory to a nonconforming structure, it shall be discontinued on the same date on which the nonconforming use of the building or structure is discontinued. 
D.  Relocation. No building in which a nonconforming use is conducted may be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the use of that lot conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which the building is to be moved. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.13.020) 
17.13.030. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES. 
A.  Alterations or Enlargements of Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure may be altered or enlarged only if the alteration or enlargement does not increase the extent of the nonconformity or add another nonconformity. For example, a building that does not meet a yard depth requirement may have another floor added, so long as the additional height and bulk comply with the applicable regulations. Likewise, a building that does not meet a yard depth requirement may be enlarged so long as the addition follows the same building wall line and does not result in an additional encroachment into the required yard area. 
B.  Intentional Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure. If a nonconforming structure is intentionally removed or destroyed by the owner, the building may be reconstructed, provided that all nonconformities, to include yard setback requirements, are eliminated. 
C.  Accidental Damage or Destruction. When a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner, it may be repaired or rebuilt provided that: 
1.  The owner can document, through building records, photographs, or plats of survey, the extent of any nonconformity that existed prior to the accidental damage or destruction; and 
2.  The intensity, extent, or nature of the previous nonconforming elements are not increased; and 
3.  Building permits for restoration or reconstruction are issued within six months from the date of accidental damage or destruction. 
D.  Relocation of a Nonconforming Structure. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the structure conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which the structure is to be located. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.13.030) 
17.13.040. - NONCONFORMING LOTS. 
A.  Nonconforming Lots in R Districts. 
1.  A nonconforming lot in an R district may be developed provided that yard depth, bulk and density restrictions of this ordinance are met. 
2.  A nonconforming lot that is enlarged yet remains nonconforming, may be developed with a single-family dwelling unit provided that yard depth, bulk and density restrictions are met. 
3.  If an existing single-family house in an R district is destroyed by accident, it may be rebuilt, provided that yard depth, bulk and density requirements are met, and the provisions of § 17.13.030 are met. 
4.  Non-residential development in an R district that is permitted by this ordinance may occur on a nonconforming lot only if a variation is granted for any and all of the nonconformities that result from inadequate lot size or width (e.g., parking requirements cannot be met). 
B.  Nonconforming Lots in Non-Residential Districts. In non-residential zoning districts a nonconforming lot may be developed provided that: 
1.  The lot in question existed in its current dimensions at the time of the effective date of this section; and 
2.  The use is permitted in the zoning district where the nonconforming lot is located; and 
3.  A variation is granted for any other nonconformities that result from inadequate lot size or width. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.13.040; Ord. No. O-29-15, § 10, 9-14-2015) 
17.13.050. - OTHER NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS. 
A.  Nonconforming Signs. Regulations for nonconforming signs are provided in Chapter 17.11 of this ordinance. 
B.  Other. Any other aspects of development not described in the provisions of this section, such as but not limited to such items as landscaping, parking, or loading, that were lawfully established but no longer comply with a standard of this zoning ordinance, shall be allowed to exist. However, such nonconforming aspects may not be altered so that the intensity, extent, or nature of the nonconformity increases. Where physically feasible, site development activities shall cause nonconformities to be brought into conformance. For example, a redesign or expansion of an off-street parking lot would result in previously nonconforming landscaping being brought into compliance. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.13.050) 
CHAPTER 17.14. - NUISANCE MITIGATION 

17.14.010. - NOISE STANDARDS. 
A.  Required Performance Level. No operation or activity shall cause or create noise in excess of the sound levels uses listed in Table 17-14-01 of this chapter. 
B.  Method of Measurement. Measurement of noise will be made in conformance with American National Standards Institute publication "Recommended Methods for Measuring Acoustic Noise Emissions," (T.1.TR.54-1997 or updated publication). 
C.  Exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from the noise level standards of this chapter: 
1.  Noises emanating from construction and maintenance activities; and 
2.  Noises of safety signals, warning devices, and emergency pressure relief valves; and 
3.  Transient noises of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes, and railroads. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.14.010) 
17.14.020. - ILLUMINATION STANDARDS. 
A.  Glare. All open off-street parking lots shall be illuminated. Table 17-14-02 of this chapter specifies minimum footcandle requirements. All such lots and other areas with illumination shall use lights that are shielded or otherwise optically controlled so as to prevent glare or create a nuisance on adjacent property. 
B.  Light Spillage. Illumination of parking lots or other areas shall limit light spillage onto adjacent property to a maximum horizontal footcandle value at the perimeter of the property in accordance with Table 17-14-03 of this chapter.

E.  Criteria to be Considered. When determining whether to approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition, the HPC shall consider and may give decisive weight to any one or all of the standards of this paragraph. In addition to the criteria, demolition should not be permitted unless the building is beyond all economically feasible repair as determined by the HPC. The criteria are: 
1.  Whether the structure has significant value as part of the historic or cultural heritage of Lemont, Cook County, the State of Illinois, or the United States. 
2.  Whether the structure is identified with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the development of Lemont, Cook County, the State of Illinois, or the United States. 
3.  Whether the structure is representative of the distinguishing characteristics of architecture inherently valuable for the study of a period, type, method of construction, or use of indigenous materials, especially the use of stone known as "Lemont limestone" or "Athens marble." 
4.  Whether the structure is a notable work of a master builder, designer, architect or artist. 
5.  Whether the structure has a unique location or singular physical characteristic that makes it an established or familiar visual feature, including presence in the Lemont skyline. 
6.  Whether the building is a particularly fine or unique example of a utilitarian structure, including but not limited to utilitarian, residential or commercial structures with a high level of integrity or architectural significance. 
7.  Whether the building, although it may or may not be designated as a landmark, is considered to be a contributing historic structure and whether it contributes to the overall character of the historic district. 
8.  Whether the demolition of the structure would create a breach in the visual streetscape of the historic district, or be detrimental to public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the historic district. 
9.  Whether any new structure proposed to be constructed upon demolition of a non-contributing structure is compatible with the buildings and environment of the historic district and would qualify for a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
10.  Whether the building or structure is in such a deteriorated condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or restore it, or whether there is a compelling health or safety reason to demolish the building or structure. Any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner which is self-created or which is the result of failure to secure or maintain the property in good repair cannot qualify as a basis for a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
11.  Whether the building is 50 years or older unless it has no historic or architectural merit. 
12.  Whether the building or structure is within a grouping of similar buildings or structures that creates a distinctive pattern or historic rhythm of masses and spaces that would be significantly altered by the removal of one or more of its parts. 
13.  Whether the building has architectural characteristics associated with hand-built buildings, such as hand-hewn timbers, scroll saw cut architectural trim, finished stone trim, or any other stone features. 
F.  Possible Repair of Building. In addition to the criteria in paragraph E of this section, demolition of building that contributes to the district's historic appearance should not be permitted unless the HPC determines that it is not economically feasible to repair the building. An evaluation may be required by the HPC, performed by an analyst experienced in historic restoration, at the expense of the applicant for demolition.

CHAPTER 17.17. - HISTORIC PRESERVATION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES 

17.17.010. - PURPOSE AND USE. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose for architectural review is to protect the unique visual qualities of a building and its site that define their sense of history from inappropriate proposed alterations that will reduce that sense. The basic principles of review are to determine that the following qualities of the building and site are compatible with both the building in question and its neighborhood context. 
B.  Use of the Standards and Guidelines. The historic preservation standards and guidelines of this chapter are intended to be followed by owners in remodeling existing buildings, adding to existing buildings, or constructing new buildings within a designated historic district. The standards and guidelines of this chapter will be the principles by which the Historic Preservation Commission will conduct its architectural review as specified in Chapter 17.16 of this ordinance. They standards and guidelines are expected to be used in the most general sense, considering that every project is unique. Many options will be available to the owner in following the intention of the standards and guidelines. Figure 17-17-01 illustrates common maintenance issues for homeowners to monitor. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.17.010) 
17.17.020. - ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW STANDARDS. 
A.  Establishing Historic Context. Prior to review of any project, the Historic Preservation Commission should establish the historic character of the property being reviewed and its context. To establish the inherent historic character of the building, the historic district, or the immediate neighborhood of the building in question, the Commission as well as property owners should evaluate the following, as appropriate: 
1.  Site 
a.  Landscaping and landscaping style 
b.  Major tree locations 
c.  Building setbacks 
d.  Garage and automobile access 
e.  Driveways 
f.  Fencing 
2.  Massing 
a.  Building height-to-width ratio 
b.  Rhythm of facade opening spacing 
c.  Major divisions of street facade into "bays" 
d.  Overall plan shape 
e.  Roof shapes 
f.  Roof slopes 
g.  Chimney location 
h.  Roof overhangs 
i.  Ratio of solid to void in the facade 
j.  Height to width ratio of windows 
3.  Scale 
a.  Lot width to building width 
b.  Number of stories 
c.  Size of material textures 
4.  Materials 
a.  Roofing materials 
b.  Gutters and downspouts 
c.  Wall materials 
d.  Trim around windows and doors 
e.  Colors of roof, walls, and trim 
f.  Decorative cornices 
g.  Window types (e.g., double hung, casement, Palladian) 
h.  Door types (e.g., flush, paneled) 
5.  Street rhythm 
a.  Historic styles in the area 
b.  Building massing of adjacent buildings 
c.  Roof shapes of adjacent buildings 
d.  Roof slopes of adjacent buildings 
B.  Architectural Standards. The Historic Preservation Commission shall use the following standards in the architectural review process: 
1.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
2.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
3.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural clements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
4.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
5.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
6.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
7.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
8.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
9.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 

10.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.17.020) 
17.17.030. - COMMERCIAL/STOREFRONT GUIDELINES. 
A.  General. Wherever possible, storefronts shall be refurbished or restored. If a new storefront is required, it should be constructed of materials similar to those of historic storefronts (i.e., metal or wood frames and glass) with proportions, heights and profiles that are appropriate to prevailing existing storefronts. See Figures 17-17-02 and 17-17-03. 
B.  Entrances/Doors. Historic entrance doors should be retained or restored. Attractive durable hardware, including brass door pulls and kick plates, add to the overall appearance of the front entrance. Additionally: 
1.  If a replacement door is needed, select a new wood/wood-like door similar in size and proportion to the original. Contemporary doors, such as flush doors, doors with moldings, cross bucks or window grilles are more residential in character and not appropriate. 
2.  Existing metal doors should be painted to be as unobtrusive as possible. Avoid bright colors in vivid contrast with the existing exterior. Colors should be muted and complementary. 
3.  Retain or restore recessed entrances. Construct new storefronts with an appropriate recessed entrance. 
4.  The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character o the buildings. 
C.  Windows/Transoms. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required to repair or replace any window within a historic district or historic landmark. Property owners should consult with the Historic Preservation Commission or the Community Development Department before purchasing new windows. Original size, division and shape of display windows within the overall storefront should be preserved. Glass should be transparent. Additionally: 
1.  Restore transom windows to glass. They may be clear, beveled, leaded, etched, or prism glass. The area can also be used for signage painted on the glass. Retain existing prism glass transoms. 
2.  If a ceiling has been lowered, dark painted panels can be placed behind transom windows to simulate transparency and depth. 
3.  Do not reduce size of windows. Do not use non-rectangular-irregularly shaped windows such as trapezoids. 
4.  Retain all decorative wood around windows, including lintels, pediments and hoods. 
D.  Facades. 
1.  Original bulkhead materials should always be retained, maintained or uncovered when possible. 
2.  If new bulkheads are required, they should be of a material appropriate to the particular storefront and structure, e.g., wood panels, polished stone, glass, tile, or stone. 
3.  Retain original stone, brick, or siding wherever possible. 
4.  If replacement of siding is needed, the new siding should match the old in size, shape, and texture. Satisfactory results can be obtained if care is taken to duplicate the width of the original corner and sill boards and to retain original wooden trim at the cornice, windows and entry. 

5.  Retain original trim. When replacement is necessary, the new trim should be similar to the original in materials, size, design, and details. 
E.  Masonry/Stone. 
1.  Red or cream-colored brick and limestone were common 19 th century building materials. Do not paint limestone or brick or cover limestone or brick with siding. Masonry/stone repair requires professional assistance. 
2.  All mortar repair should match the original mortar in color, texture and composition. Masonry cleaning methods should be determined by the strength of the brick or stone. 
3.  Sandblasting should never be used on brick or stone surfaces. High pressure water blasting can also damage such surfaces. Chemical cleaners are preferable, but they must be selected carefully and applied by skilled workers. 
4.  A new facade should be designed to look appropriate and compatible with surrounding buildings. 
5.  New construction should reflect some of the detailing of surrounding buildings, e.g., window shapes, cornice lines, and brick work. 
F.  Color and Paint. If carefully placed, colors can accentuate architectural details and visually unite groups of separate buildings. Yet too many colors or inappropriately colored features could degrade the character of the building and the neighboring area. 
1.  The base color typically matches the natural color of building materials, such as brick or stone. 
2.  The trim color is used for framing the facade, doors and windows and on the cornice and major architectural elements. If used, minor trim colors should be darker and used on doors and window sashes. 
3.  Accent colors are used minimally to highlight intricate architectural details. 
4.  Limestone, terra cotta, ceramic tile, glass, and unpainted brick should not be painted. 

(UDO 2008, § 17.17.030) 
17.17.040. - RESIDENTIAL GUIDELINES. 
A.  General. Many of the design guidelines for commercial/storefronts are also appropriate for residential construction, remodeling, and additions. Refer to § 17.17.030 above. 
1.  Retain original roofline. 
2.  Retain dormers and dormer windows. 
3.  Retain original siding. If replacement is necessary, replace with siding that matches the original's size, shape and texture. 
4.  Do not paint limestone or brick or cover limestone or brick with siding. 
5.  On masonry/stone structures, all mortar repair should match the original mortar in color, texture and composition. 
6.  Avoid the use of metal or fiberglass awnings, particularly on building sides facing streets. 
7.  See Figure 17-17-04 for additional residential guidelines. 
B.  Shutters. Shutters should only be added to buildings where they might have originally been used. They should be constructed of wood and be operable. They should measure the height of the window and be half of its width. 
C.  Doors. Retain and repair elements of the entry such as sidelights glazed transoms and decorative moldings or pilasters. If new sliding glass doors are to be used, they should be installed only at the rear of the building, away from public view, on the ground floor. 
D.  Decorative Trim. Retain original trim. Where replacement is necessary, it should be with detail similar to the original in materials, size and design. If it is not possible to replicate missing or deteriorated trim, new trim should match the original as closely as the budget will allow. It is important to save any trim that is removed because it can be duplicated in white pine with a jigsaw and drill. 
E.  Porches. Retain and repair original detailing (posts, rails, trim and lattice apron). If steps need to be replaced, rebuild them with materials appropriate to the facade. 

(UDO 2008, § 17.17.040) 
17.17.050. - NEW CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES. 
    New structures in a historic district should be compatible with the architectural styles and design of the district. In addition to other guidelines in this chapter, the following applies to new construction: 
A.  Height. The height of any new construction should be compatible with the style and character of the surrounding structures. 
B.  Proportions of Windows and Doors. The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the surrounding structures. 
C.  Relationship of Building Masses and Spaces. The relationship of a structure within a historic district to the open space between it and the adjoining structures should be compatible. 
D.  Roof Shape. The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the surrounding structures. 
E.  Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural character and appearance of the historic district. 
F.  Scale. The scale of the structure should be compatible with its architectural style and with surrounding structures in the historic district. 
G.  Directional Expression. A structure should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures and with their architectural style and character. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.17.050) 
17.17.060. - SIGN STANDARDS. 
    The provisions of this section apply to signs in the historic district and are in addition to the provisions found in Chapter 17.11 of this ordinance. Where these provisions conflict with another provision of this ordinance, the stricter, or more restrictive, provision shall apply. 
A.  Wall Signs. 
1.  Wall signs shall not project more than eight inches from the wall. 
2.  Wall signs on the front facade of a building shall not project higher than the bottom of the window sills of the second floor or other second floor architectural features of the building, whichever is less. 
3.  Wall signs shall not extend with two feet of the edge of a wall. Murals are prohibited on facades. 
4.  Wall signs shall be limited to a maximum of two square feet of sign area for every one linear foot of entrance-side building width. 
5.  Wall signs on facades must be dimensional signs. Wall signs on other elevations may be flat if they are constructed of wood or metal. 
B.  Projecting Signs. 
1.  Projecting signs shall have only two faces; 
2.  Projecting signs shall be a maximum of eight square feet in size; 
3.  Projecting Signs shall be dimensional signs. 
C.  Sign Materials and Colors. 
1.  The following sign constructions are prohibited: channel letters, symbols and graphics; pan face signs; and cabinet signs. 
2.  Awning signs shall be of canvas. Awning frame members shall be a maximum of one inch in diameter. 
3.  Neon tubing is permitted. 
4.  Fluorescent and/or reflective materials and/or paints are prohibited. 
D.  General Sign Guidelines . 
1.  Signs shall complement and enhance the architecture of the building on which they are located and not be in conflict with the building architecture. They should not obscure, cover or be inharmonious with existing architectural features and proportions. 
2.  Generally, serif fonts are recommended but are not required. 
3.  Wood or metal sign boards, or modern materials simulating wood or metal, are recommended.

ARTICLE IV. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
CHAPTER 17.18. - LAND/CASH CONTRIBUTIONS 

17.18.010. - TITLE. 
    This Chapter of the Village of Lemont Unified Development Ordinance shall be known and cited as the Village of Lemont Land and Cash Ordinance. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.010) 
17.18.020. - PURPOSE. 
    This chapter is intended to assure the provision of adequate public facilities needed to serve new development within the local government by requiring each new development as a condition of approval to pay its share of the costs of such improvements or park space. Additionally, this chapter is intended to mitigate the adverse impacts on community facilities and park space by providing a means of allocating the costs of needed services and facilities among new developments in proportion to the demand for such facilities created by each new development. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.020) 
17.18.030. - AUTHORITY. 
    This chapter, as incorporated into this Unified Development Ordinance, is adopted pursuant to the Village's Ordinance No. 363, and its updates and amendments as approved in the Village's Ordinances No. 606, 902, 26-99, and 4-04. Additionally, this chapter incorporates the purposes, intent, and provisions of the Village's Ordinance 0-42-06, "An Ordinance Establishing Public Safety Impact Fees in the Village of Lemont." 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.030) 
17.18.040. - APPLICABILITY. 
    This Land Cash Ordinance and any future amendments to it shall apply to all new Final Plats of Subdivision, special use approvals for planned unit developments, or other instances where the number of dwelling units allowed on a lot or parcel is increased. This applicability shall include all areas within the boundaries of the Village of Lemont and extend to areas within the Village's 1.5-mile planning review area. Other fees required of developers outside this ordinance may apply. The dedications of land or cash contribution in lieu of land required by this ordinance shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of land, or as a condition to the subdivision of land either within the Village or within 1.5 miles of the Village limits, and such provisions shall be incorporated into any pre-annexation agreement or annexation agreement governing such land. (Ordinance 0-36-08) 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.040; Ord. No. O-65-11, § 21, 10-24-2011; Ord. No. O-38-12, § 1 (Exh. A), 5-14-2012) 
17.18.050. - LAND/CASH CONTRIBUTIONS. 
    As a condition of approval of final plat of subdivision or of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, for library purposes, and for school sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or to make cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the Village in accordance with the following criteria and formulas. Additionally, in the case of residential development or subdivision that involves annexation of territory to the Village, the applicant will be required to donate land/cash for fire protection purposes. Land contributions shall occur at the time of final plat approval. Cash contributions shall occur at the time of application for building permits. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.050; Ord. No. O-38-12, § 1 (Exh. A), 5-14-2012) 
17.18.060. - CRITERIA FOR PARK LAND DEDICATION. 
A.  Requirement and Population Ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be 10 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population in accordance with the classifications in Table 17-18-01 of this chapter. 
TABLE 17-18-01. 

Recreation Type and Size Type of Recreation Area Play lot Minimum of 8,000 sq. ft. School-Park, Neighborhood Playground Minimum of 5 acres Neighborhood Park Minimum of 3.5 acres District-Wide Park or Play Field Minimum of 4 acres up to 30 acres Community-Wide Park Minimum of 12 acres up to 30 acres  
B.  Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the site of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. In general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially high degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the Village and, before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private "swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and than subtract the credit to be given. 
C.  Park Site Criteria. 
1.  The park site shall be so located as to be readily accessible to the people within the subdivision or planned unit development. Play and athletic fields and large park sites must be conveniently accessible to the community at large. 
2.  Proper ingress, egress and curb cuts shall be provided. For water areas, provisions must be made for pathway/driveway around these areas for emergency vehicles and police patrol. Provisions for major use of a pathway/driveway for bike riding, walkway, jogging trail and pedestrian traffic shall be made. 
D.  Environmental Quality. 
1.  Land to be dedicated for park sites shall be approved by the Village according to its environmental quality, as well as its suitability for active and passive recreational activities. The land is to be dry and usable at all times and not subject to flooding or used as detention. Should a donation include a detention/retention area over and above the 5.5 acres required per 1,000 of ultimate population estimated to be generated by the development, the Park District may accept said additional land. No bogs or swamps shall be acceptable as required park sites. Lakes and native prairie wetlands shall not normally be acceptable, but may be approved by the Village where the area offers an exceptional amenity or the change to protect a significant natural resource. No site that has been part of an unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall be acceptable as required park acreage. 
2.  Every effort shall be made to conserve for public use and enjoyment those areas of significant natural and environmental value. Except in those specific areas designated by the Village for development as play fields or other active areas, all trees, other plant materials, streams and other natural features shall be retained on land to be dedicated for park site use, unless specifically cited by the Village for removal by the developer. 
E.  Shape. Dedicated park sites shall be regularly configured to permit efficient park programming, security and maintenance. Sites shall be rectangular, or nearly rectangular, in shape with no interior angle of the boundary line less than 60 degrees, unless specifically approved by the Village. Narrow strips of land, small parcels that intrude into adjacent orderly development or left over parcels that are oddly shaped or located shall be avoided. 
F.  Improvements. 
1.  Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in accordance with the Village's subdivision code and water retention/detention requirements, except as varied by the specific terms of this ordinance, an annexation agreement or planned unit development ordinance. 
2.  All sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefore. In addition, location of hydrants shall be made in conformance with Village requirements. Provision for water for watering vegetation and flooding for ice skating shall be made where appropriate. Sewers for possible installation of restrooms/shelter as a later date shall be provided. Electricity for streetlights for future lighting for shelters and security shall be provided. Security lighting along pathway shall be provided. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.060; Ord. No. O-65-11, § 22, 10-24-2011; Ord. No. O-38-12, § 1 (Exh. A), 5-14-2012) 
17.18.070. - CRITERIA FOR SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION. 
A.  Requirement and Population Ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the (2) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein and then applying such ratio to the (3) said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the areas of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased number of children in each school classification. 
B.  School Classification and Size of School Site. School classifications and size of school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the criteria in Table 17-18-02 of this chapter. 
TABLE 17-18-02. 

School Type, Size, and Acreage School Classification By Grade Maximum Number 
of Students Minimum Number 
of Acres Elementary schools, grades K-5 650 15 Junior high, 
grades 6-8 1,200 25 High school, 
grades 9-12 3,000 80  
C.  Location. The Comprehensive School Plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected School District shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.070) 
17.18.080. - CONTRIBUTIONS IN LIEU OF PARK, SCHOOL, AND LIBRARY SITES. 
A.  Cash Contribution. Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, for library purposes or a school site, the Village shall require a subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. 
1.  The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the Village or at the discretion of the Village, paid directly to the public body affected solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the resident of that subdivision. 
2.  The cash contributions in lieu of school sites or school improvements shall be held in trust by the Village or at the discretion of the Village, paid directly to the public body affected solely for the acquisition of land for school sites or for improvements to school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school site or facility which already serves such needs. 
3.  If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation or library land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purpose set forth herein within 12 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded, without interest, to the developer who made such contribution. 
4.  Where cash contributions are made in lieu of land dedication, the affected public body shall acknowledge receipt of payment or Installment Agreement acceptable to the Village. Any payment of money or dedication of land received under the terms of this ordinance shall require the affected public body to execute an Indemnity and Hold Harmless Agreement as to the use of funds consistent with the terms of the Ordinance. 
5.  The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation, library and school sites. It has been determined that the present 'fair market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the Village is $150,000 per acre, and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by the Park District, School District or other. 
B.  Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee. There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
1.  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park, library or school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park, library or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 
2.  A major part of the local park or recreation site, library site, or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.

17.18.090. - DENSITY FORMULA. 
    The densities listed in Table 17-18-03 of this Chapter are generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population attached hereto, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and, in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the Village Board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by the Park District, School District, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.

    Example of Impact Fee Computation. Below is an example of the computation for impact fees. It is intended to serve as a step-by-step guide for interested parties. 
    A homeowner intends to divide its lot into two residential lots. He/she intends to tear down the existing home and build two-four bedroom detached single family homes. Because there will be one additional home that will impact the various taxing districts, impact fees shall be paid based on the additional home. Impact fees are paid to the Lemont Park District, Lemont-Bromberek Combined School District 113A, and Lemont High School District 210. 
1.  Based on Table 17-18-03, the additional four bedroom house would expect to have the following population, further broken down by age of resident. 
  0.418 Pre-school students 
  0.530 Elementary students 
  0.298 Junior High students 
  0.360 High School students 
  2.158 Adults 
  3.764 total per dwelling unit 
2.  Park District 
  Per the Park Land Dedication and Population Formula, the Lemont Park District requires 10 acres of land per 1,000 of total population. The total acreage is multiplied by the fair market value for an acre of land to determine contribution. 
  (10 × 3.764)/1,000 = 0.03764 acres 
  Park District Contribution: 0.03764 × $150,000 = $5,646 
3.  Elementary Schools, grades K-5 
  Per the School Type, Size, and Acreage Table, 15 acres of land are required per 650 elementary school students. The total acreage is multiplied by the fair market value for an acre of land to determine contribution. 
  (15 × 0.530)/650 = 0.0122307 acres 
  Elementary School Contribution: 0.0122307 × $150,000 = $1,834.61 
4.  Junior High Schools, grades 6-8 
  Per the School Type, Size, and Acreage Table, 215 acres of land is required per 1,200 junior high school students. The total acreage is multiplied by the fair market value for an acre of land to determine contribution. 
  (25 × 0.298)/1,200 = 0.0062083 
  Junior High School Contribution: 0.0062083 × $150,000 = $931.25 
5.  High Schools, grades 9-12 
  Per the School Type, Size, and Acreage Table, 80 acres of land is required per 3,000 high school students. The total acreage is multiplied by the fair market value for an acre of land to determine contribution. 
  (80 × 0.360)/3,000 = 0.0096 
  High School Contribution: 0.0096 × $150,000 = $1,440 
6.  Total Cash Contribution for the addition of one four bedroom single family home: 
  $5,646 + $1,834.61 + $931.25 + $1,440 = ;uu;$9,851.86;uu; 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.090) 
17.18.100. - RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND. 
    Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the Village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land, or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit development that the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the Village or other public body designated by the Village, provided that such acquisition is made within one year from substantial development completion. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.100) 
17.18.110. - COMBINING SITES WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENTS. 
    Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than 40 acres, public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas, library sites or school sites without hardship to a particular developer. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.110) 
17.18.120. - TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADING. 
    The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.120) 
17.18.130. - IMPROVED SITES. 
    All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made herefore. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition of "improved" sites may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school or library site and construction of school or library facilities thereon. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.18.130) 
17.18.140. - PUBLIC SAFETY CONTRIBUTIONS. 
A.  Purpose. The Village anticipates a continued population increase due to the subdivision and planned unit development of land within its jurisdiction. While continuing to welcome the addition of new residents, the Village recognizes that the addition of new residents to the municipality will impose immediate additional financial and user demands upon the public safety facilities and services. Therefore the Village has determined that cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication or in lieu of a combination of both shall be required of each annexing developer. 
B.  Contributions. The applicants for all annexations into the Village, unless waived by the Village Board after the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, shall contribute Public Safety Impact Fees in accordance with the following schedule: 
1.  For each single-family attached or single-family detached dwelling a contribution of $1,000.00 shall be made; and 
2.  For each multi-family dwelling unit a contribution of $1,000.00 shall be made. 
C.  Use of Contributions. The Village, upon receipt of any contribution made under the provisions of this section, shall use such contributions exclusively for the acquisition of real property, the acquisition of capital equipment for public safety use, and the construction or expansion of public safety facilities caused by the increased growth of the Village.

    Applicant. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application. 
    Appropriate Use. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in § 17.19.070.B. 
    Base Flood. The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in § 17.19.050 of this Ordinance. 
    Base Flood Elevation (BFE). The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the base flood. 
    Basement. That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

2.  If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile. 
3.  Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining Sections of this Ordinance. 
B.  Professional Engineer Review. 
1.  If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer under the employ or contract of the Village for review to ensure that the development meets § 17.19.070 or § 17.19.080.

17.19.050. - BASE FLOOD ELEVATION. 
    This Ordinance's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the Village. 
A.  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. 
B.  When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site. 
C.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of any river, creek, or stream shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated August 19, 2008 and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
D.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
E.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County. 
F.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. 
1.  When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. 
2.  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. 
3.  For a non-riverine SFHA, the Base Flood Elevation shall be the historic Flood of Record plus three feet (3), unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. 
4.  For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile) which has been identified by the Planning and Economic Development Director pursuant to § 17.19.040.A.3, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in § 17.19.050.F. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.19.050; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012) 
17.19.060. - OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS. 
    Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this Ordinance. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this Section, along with the requirements of § 17.19.090. 
A.  Development Permit. 
1.  No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Planning and Economic Development Director. 
2.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Planning and Economic Development Director. 
a.  The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the North American Vertical Datum of' 1988, and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. 
b.  For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of § 17.19.090 of this ordinance. 
3.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Planning and Economic Development Director shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
a.  Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a permit as required by this ordinance is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Ordinance, Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map is subject to the provisions of this ordinance. 
b.  The Planning and Economic Development Director shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification. 
4.  A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
5.  The Planning and Economic Development Director shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The Planning and Economic Development Director shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. 
B.  Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
1.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
2.  Compensatory Storage. 
a.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
b.  The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.0 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. 
c.  In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. 
d.  All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. 
e.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
C.  Construction of the Lowest Floor Below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the Village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The Planning and Economic Development Director shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsection. 
1.  Compensatory storage shall be provided per § 17.19.060.B.2. 
2.  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE). 
3.  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten (10) feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the Planning and Economic Development Director may waive the ten (10) foot minimum setback if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certify that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met, The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the Planning and Economic Development Director for review. The Planning and Economic Development Director may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four (4) feet. 
4.  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty (20) feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the Planning and Economic Development Director may waive the twenty (20) foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four (4) feet. 
5.  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five (5) feet thick under the basement floor slab, Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
6.  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
7.  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions, 
8.  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five (5) below the BFE. 
9.  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one quarter (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
10.  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
11.  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
12.  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the Planning and Economic Development Director may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer. 
13.  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed eighteen (18) inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

B.  Preventing Increased Damages and a List of Appropriate Uses. 
1.  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are Appropriate Uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat, Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this ordinance. Only those Appropriate Uses listed in 17 III. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved Appropriate Uses are as follows: 
a.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
b.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses. 
c.  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls. 
d.  Underground and overhead utilities. 
e.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
f.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
g.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto. 
h.  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
(i)  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1,0 foot; or 
(ii)  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
i.  Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive non-crosive slop toward a watercourse. 
j.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than 10 feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
k.  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to fifty (50%) percent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
l.  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to fifty (50%) percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
2.  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an Appropriate Use. 
3.  Within the designated floodway, the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of § 17.19.090 of this ordinance: 
a.  Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(i)  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)). 
(ii)  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover. 
(i)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:

Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
(ii)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
(iii)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of down-stream water quality. 
  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
(iv)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of § 17.19.070. 
j.  Seeding and Stabilization Plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k.  Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:

In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
(ii)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
(iii)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel, Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
(iv)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (See § 17.19.070.B.3). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
(v)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 199.5). 
l.  Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
m.  General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations.

2.  For the purposes of this section, a "minor revision" shall be considered when there is no reduction in the quality of plant material, no significant change in size or location of plant material, and new plants are of the same general category (e.g., canopy, ornamental trees), and have the same general design characteristics as the materials being replaced. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.20.030; Ord. No. O-69-12, § 2, 11-26-2012) 
17.20.040. - GENERAL LANDSCAPE STANDARDS. 
    [A.-G. Reserved.] 
H.  General Guide. The most recent edition of the American Standards for Nursery Stock, ANZI Z60.1, published by the American Nursery and Landscape Association (www.anla.org), shall be the guide for selection, measurement, installation, and maintenance of all plant material. 
I.  Plant Units. A "plant unit" is a measurement used to determine the quantity of plant material required for specific situations. The plant unit requirements establish the total amount of plant material while allowing flexibility in the selection and distribution of plants. One plant unit is comprised of ALL of the following: 
1.  0.5 canopy trees; 
2.  1.0 evergreen trees; 
3.  1.5 understory/ornamental trees; and 
4.  6.0 shrubs or 6.0 minimum 18-inch containers of ornamental/native grasses. 
J.  Substitutions. The Planning and Economic Development Director may approve the substitution of canopy trees or understory/ornamental trees for evergreen trees in cases where the desire for visibility outweighs the desire for screening (e.g., shopping center would need to be screened where adjacent to residential property, but desire for visibility would be greater along road frontage). 
K.  Plant Mix. For each plant type (e.g., canopy tree) associated with the requirements of this chapter, no single plant species shall represent more than 50% of the total plantings. This requirement may be waived by the Planning and Economic Development Director in instances where the number of plants for a particular plant type required is five or less. 
L.  Existing Vegetation. Credit against the landscape requirements of this chapter may be allowed by the Planning and Economic Development Director for existing vegetation of a quality and size which the applicant purposes to preserve. In all cases the Planning and Economic Development Director may attach conditions to the granting of such credits to secure or enhance the survival rate of existing plants during construction. The existing vegetation for which credit is given shall be indicated on the landscape plan. 
M.  Plant Selection. Plants shall be healthy, free of insects and diseases and physical damage (e.g., bark bruises, cracked branches). Native species should be considered, and plants shall be species normally grown in Northeastern Illinois. Plant selection shall adhere to the specific species listings, as updated from time to time, and attached to this ordinance as Appendix F. (This appendix lists approved trees for use along streets, plants prohibited for use in landscaping, and native plants which are encouraged to be included in landscaping.) Additionally, plant selection shall be based on: 
1.  Climate hardiness of plant material; and 
2.  Disease and pest resistance and stress tolerance; and 
3.  Adaptability of proposed plant material to the particular microclimate in which it is to be located; and 
4.  Overall year-round ornamental effect; and 
5.  Screening ability, particularly in those areas where plants will be used to provide screens for residential uses. 
N.  Minimum Sizes of Plants. The minimum size for plants at the time of installation shall be: 
1.  Canopy trees in a parkway - 3" caliper 
2.  Canopy trees not in a parkway - 21/2" caliper 
3.  Evergreen trees - 8' in height 
4.  Ornamental trees, single trunk - 2" caliper 
5.  Ornamental trees, multi-trunk - 6' in height 
6.  Large shrubs - 24" in height 
7.  Small shrubs - 18" in height 
O.  Sod, Topsoil, and Seeding. 
1.  Landscaping in parkways shall be a minimum of four inches of topsoil and sod. 
2.  Landscape seeding shall be Class 1A seeding mixture. 
3.  Standards for Residential Construction: 
a.  Front and side yards shall be landscaped with a minimum of four inches of topsoil and sod. 
b.  Rear yards shall be landscaped with a minimum of four inches of topsoil and sod or seed. All seeded areas must be protected with an erosion control blanket (ECB) installed in accordance with the Illinois Urban Manual, 2002, or latest edition. 
P.  Energy Conservation. 
1.  Deciduous trees which are sun tolerant should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade. 
2.  Evergreens and other shade tolerant plants should be concentrated in the northside of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds. 
Q.  Installation. 
1.  All plant material shall be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of the American Standards for Nursery Stock, ANZI Z60.1, published by the American Nursery and Landscape Association (www.anla.org). 
2.  The nurseries supplying plants may be visited before planting. Trees which are suited for the street tree planting requirements will be inspected and selected by the Village Arborist. 
3.  Only trees dug with the root ball from the nursery growing location will be acceptable. Trees with a composition or processed ball will be rejected, unless pre-approved by the Village Arborist. 
4.  No trees shall be dug or loaded for shipment from the vendor nursery when the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit and when the depth of frost in the ground exceeds one inch. All trees, which upon delivery, exhibit evidence of being or having been wholly or partially frozen, shall be rejected. 
5.  Trees on which the buds have opened or which are in full or partial leaf may be rejected. 
6.  Any existing dead trees or root balls shall be removed. Trees shall be planted in accordance with the attached tree planting detail and as described below. The top of the root ball shall be two inches above finished grade. If additional compacted clay or stone is required in the bottom of the planting hole to achieve this grade, then it shall be supplied by the contractor. Wire baskets that cover no more than the lower 1/3 of the root ball are permitted. Larger wire baskets shall be removed or cut to that height. 
7.  Set balled and burlapped (B&B) stock on un-excavated bottom of tree pit plumb and in center of pit or trench. Till 18 inches around tree pit. When set, place additional topsoil backfill around base and sides of ball and work each layer to settle backfill and eliminate voids and air pockets. When excavation is approximately 2/3 full, water thoroughly before placing remainder of backfill. Repeat watering until no more is absorbed. Water again after placing final layer of backfill. No treated burlap or nylon or polyethylene rot-proof wrapping material is permitted and must be removed. Tie and wrap material that is intended to rot. 
8.  In most instances, the backfill around the ball shall be the same soil as that which was removed from the hole; however, in cases where rocks, stones, etc. are encountered, topsoil shall be used. Any excess soil, debris or trimmings shall be removed from the planting site immediately upon completion of planting. 
9.  Where necessary, trees shall be staked to ensure they will be straight. 
10.  The species identifying labels shall remain on the tree until species verification is completed by the Village. Other tags wires, plastic ties and wire baskets shall be removed from each tree. 
11.  Wrapping of all trees shall be done immediately after they are planted. 
R.  Thinning. The branches of deciduous trees and shrubs may be selectively thinned by up to one-third in accordance with good horticultural practice. However, trimming shall not result in reducing the overall size of the plant below that specified in the approved landscape plan. 
S.  Mulching. All trees and shrubs shall be mulched with a minimum of three-inch depth of shredded bark, wood chips, or other organic mulch. All perennial, annual, or groundcover beds shall be mulched with a minimum of a two-inch depth of shredded bark, wood chips, or other organic mulch. 
T.  Rejection of Materials. The Village Arborist or the Director of Public Works may reject any plant material which does not comply with the specification, and all rejected plant material shall be immediately removed from the site by the contractor. The Village will not assume any responsibility for such rejected material.

a.  The fence shall consist at a minimum of wooden snow fence (and erosion control fence where siltation may occur), secured to metal posts at a maximum interval of eight feet. 
b.  No attachments, fences or wires, other than approved materials for bracing, guying or wrapping shall be attached to any vegetation during the construction period. 
c.  All fencing must remain in place during the entire construction period. 
d.  All fencing must run continuously from property line to property line, completely enclose an area, or adjoin other fencing in order to protect the vegetation that is to remain on the site. 
e.  Signs which are legible at a distance of 10 feet shall be posted and maintained at intervals no less than 30 feet which state: "Tree Protection Area. Do not enter. Do not move or alter fence. Violation subject to fine and work stoppage." 
f.  Erect erosion control measures as required by this ordinance and approved plans. 
7.  A site visit and sign-off by the Village Arborist and the Village Engineer is required after the above items have been completed and before site development can begin. 
D.  Replacement of Removed or Damaged Trees. 
1.  If trees marked for preservation on the tree preservation plan are damaged or removed, the Village may impose a fine based on the caliper inch per damaged or removed tree. 
2.  In addition to any fines imposed, trees marked for preservation on the tree preservation plan that are damaged or removed during site development or construction shall be replaced as follows: 
a.  Each tree measuring 8-12 inches in caliper shall be replaced with two trees of at least 2.5-inch caliper each. 
b.  Each tree measuring 13-18 inches in caliper shall be replaced with three trees of at least 2.5-inch caliper each. 
c.  Each tree measuring 19-24 inches in caliper shall be replaced with four trees of at least 2.5-inch caliper each. 
d.  Each tree measuring 25 inches or more in caliper shall be replaced with five trees of at least 2.5-inch caliper each. 
3.  If on-site replacement of trees in accordance with paragraph 1 above is impractical, the Village shall determine a suitable off-site location for the planting of the replacement trees. 
4.  In all cases the cost of the trees and planting of the trees shall be borne by the applicant for site development and/or construction. 
E.  Tree Preservation Plan Requirements. When required by this ordinance, a tree survey shall be conducted by a qualified arborist or landscape architect, and a tree preservation plan shall be based on this survey. The tree preservation plan shall include the following information: 
1.  For each tree six inches in diameter breast height (DBH) or larger, the plan shall show:

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-38-12, § 2 (Exh. B), adopted May 14, 2012, repealed the former Ch. 17.22, § § 17.22.010-17.22.040, and enacted a new Ch. 17.22 as set out herein. The former Ch. 17.22 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from UDO 2008, § § 17.22.010-17.22.040; Ord. No. 0-54-09. 

17.22.010. - BACKGROUND. 
A.  Purpose . The variety in the exterior appearance of single-family dwellings enhances the appearance of the community, and the Village Board hereby deems it in the best interest of the community to discourage excessive similarity and encourage distinctiveness of exterior design in single-family. Specifically the purposes of this chapter are to: 
1.  Promote an aesthetically pleasing character in Lemont's residential districts; and 
2.  Protect and enhance property values; and 
3.  Encourage new dwelling construction of distinctive design; and 
4.  Discourage excessive similarity among adjacent dwelling units. 
B.  History . This chapter, amended, updates and replaces the Village's Ordinance No. 791, "Appearance Code," adopted on May 24, 1993. 
(Ord. No. O-38-12, § 2 (Exh. B), 5-14-2012) 
17.22.020. - DESIGN VARIETY IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. 
A.  Applicability . The provisions of this section shall apply to all new single-family residential construction. 
B.  Proximity Standard. Before a building permit is issued, the Zoning Administrator shall determine that the proposed new single-family dwelling is dissimilar in appearance, i.e. is not similar, to any single-family dwelling on the same street which is within two lots of the proposed new single-family dwelling. A single-family dwelling on a corner lot may be considered dissimilar to another single-family dwelling if the two subject dwellings face different streets. On a cul-de-sac or turnaround, new a single-family dwelling must be dissimilar to at least three other existing or planned single-family dwellings on the same cul-de-sac or turnaround. 
C.  Comparison Procedure. The proposed new single-family dwelling shall be compared to all other existing or other proposed single-family dwellings that fall within the range of the proximity standard of paragraph B above. The proposed dwelling shall be compared with only one other dwelling at a time. If the criteria in paragraph D below are met, then the proposed dwelling is compared to another dwelling that meets the proximity standard, and so forth. The criteria met in one comparison do not need to match the criteria met in another comparison. 
D.  Criteria . When comparing the proposed new single-family dwelling to another single-family dwelling subject to the proximity standards of paragraph B of this section, the two buildings shall be deemed dissimilar, i.e., not similar in appearance, when the criteria in the four sub-paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 below are met or the criteria in subparagraph five are met. 
1.  Exterior materials and details. The exterior materials on the façade or the details on the facade of the subject buildings shall differ by at least two of the following ways: 
a.  The percentage of at least one exterior material, e.g., brick, on the proposed building shall be changed by at least 20 percent from the same material on the other subject building. 
b.  The color or size/type of brick, decorative stone or synthetic stone on the proposed building differs from the color or size/type of brick or stone on the other subject building. 
c.  The orientation of siding on the proposed building differs from the orientation of siding on the other subject building. 
d.  A water table at least three feet in height is incorporated on the proposed building and there shall be a lack of wainscot or a water table on the other subject building. 
e.  The incorporation of quoins facing a public street on the proposed building is different from the incorporation of quoins on the other subject building. Here, "different" may mean that one building lacks quoins while the other one does not, or it may mean that the size, the length, the shape and the materials of the quoins on the subject building substantially varies. 
f.  The presence or incorporation of belt courses, brick soldier courses, or other brick or stone detail on the proposed building is extensively different from such architectural features on the other subject building. "Extensively" in this case shall mean that the detail is incorporated throughout the facade rather than one specific window, entrance, or portion of the facade. Such presence or incorporation of said items used as lintels shall not factor into this standard, but may factor into the standards for fenestration found in paragraph D.3 below. 
2.  Entrance features and other façade features. The front or main entrance to the subject buildings shall differ by at least one of the following ways: 
a.  The entrance surround on the proposed building consists of different elements, such side windows or transoms, as found on the other subject building. 
b.  The incorporation or lack of bay windows, oriels, porches, or columns on the proposed building differs from the other subject building. 
3.  Fenestration. The design and disposition of windows and other exterior openings on the subject buildings shall differ in at least one of the following ways: 
a.  The number of windows on the façade of the proposed new single-family dwelling differs from the number of windows on the facade of the other subject building. 
b.  The presence or incorporation of masonry lintels or arches over windows on the facade of the proposed single-family dwelling is different from the presence or incorporation of masonry lintels on the facade of the other subject building. Here "different" could mean that one building uses one type of arch (e.g., a Roman arch), while the other building uses another type of arch (e.g., a bowspring arch). Alternatively, "different" could mean that a solid stone lintel is used on one building and a solid stone jack arch is used on the other building. 
c.  The type of window incorporated into the facade of the proposed building differs from the type of window incorporated into the facade of the other subject building. For example, one building may have casement windows and the other building may have double-hung windows. 
4.  Roof line. The roof or roof line shall differ by at least one of the following ways: 
a.  The presence or the incorporation of dormers on the façade of the proposed building is different from the presence or incorporation of dormers on the facade of the other subject building. Here "different" may mean that the number and arrangement of dormers is varied, or that the height, width, roof angle or material of the dormers is different. 
b.  The roof type of the proposed building is different from the roof type of the other subject building. For example, one building may have a hip roof and the other building may have a gabled roof. 
c.  The roof line of a front porch on the proposed building is different from the roof line of a front porch on the other subject building. 
d.  The number or arrangement of gables on the facade of the proposed building is different from the number or arrangement of gables on the façade of the other subject building. 
5.  Building massing. Building massing shall differ in at least two of the following ways: 
a.  The height, as viewed from the front of the residence, shall differ by at least 15 percent; or 
b.  The width, as viewed from the front of the residence, shall differ by at least 15 percent; or 
c.  The length of the roofline, as viewed from the front of the residence, shall differ by at least 30%. In instances were one roofline, as viewed from the front of the residence, is a peaked roof, then the other roofline, as viewed from the front of the residence, shall have a horizontal run of at least eight feet; or 
d.  The roof pitch angle, as viewed from the front of the residence, shall differ by at least 25 degrees. 
E.  Dissimilarity Clarified. The following characteristics shall not by themselves constitute dissimilarity among two otherwise similar dwellings: 

1.  Variations in color, except as allowed in sub-paragraph B.1 of this section; 
2.  Variations in roofing material; 
3.  Reversal of plan orientation.

CHAPTER 17.24. - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL 

17.24.010. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
A.  Findings. 
1.  Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
2.  The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
3.  Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out fills and embankments; 
4.  Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs; 
5.  Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and 
6.  Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increasing chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety. 
B.  Purpose. The provisions of this chapter are intended to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movements of earth on land situated in the Village. It is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land-disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural, undisturbed state. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.24.010) 
17.24.020. - DEFINITIONS. 
    For the purposes of this chapter certain terms used herein are defined as set forth below: 
A.  "Cubic yards" means the amount of material in excavation and/or fill measured by the method of "average end areas." 
B.  "Ravine" means a deep, steep-sloped cleft or gorge in the earth's surface, which is caused by runoff and stream action. Ravines are characterized by abundant growth of trees and other plants. 
C.  "Removal" means cutting vegetation to the ground or stumps, complete extraction, or killing by spraying. 
D.  "Site" means a lot or parcel of land, or a contiguous combination thereof, where grading work is performed as a single unified operation. 
E.  "Stream" means any river, creek, brook, branch, flowage, ravine, or natural or man-made drainageway which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either perennially or intermittently. 
F.  "Stripping" means any activity which removes the vegetative surface cover including tree removal, clearing, and storage or removal of top soil. 
G.  "Vacant" means land on which there are no structures or only structures which are secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.24.020) 
17.24.030. - SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED. 
    Unless otherwise provided for by this ordinance, no person shall commence or perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, or filing of land without having first obtained a site development permit from the Village. See § 17.23.020 of this ordinance for the criteria for site development permits and exemptions. See Appendix E of this ordinance for the submittal requirements for engineering plans and site development permits. 
(UDO 2008, § 17.24.030) 
17.24.040. - EROSION CONTROL GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS. 
A.  Applicability. All activities subject to a site development permit shall be subject to the provisions of this section. 
B.  Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the Village or its officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage, by: 
1.  The issuance of a permit under this ordinance; 
2.  Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions attached to it by the village; 
3.  Failure of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions; 
4.  Failure of Village officials to recommend denial of, or to deny a permit; or 
5.  Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Erosion and Sedimentation Control Guidelines. Measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year frequency or less. The following guidelines shall apply to all development activities: 
1.  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
2.  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures. 
3.  Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond or wetland. Preventive measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation. 
4.  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
5.  Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development. 
6.  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and benefits involved. 
7.  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
8.  Provision should be made to accommodate the increasing runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainage ways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion onsite or downstream. 
9.  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development. 
10.  Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development. 
11.  All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water. 
12.  All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
13.  To the maximum extent possible, ravines, bluffs and natural drainage ways shall remain nonbuildable, undisturbed areas. In cases where alteration is allowed, the alteration shall be minimized. No clearing, excavation, filling, grading or stripping shall be permitted within a ravine, bluff or natural drainage way, unless the land-disturbing activity involves: 
a.  Installation of an underground utility where alternative locations are impractical; or 
b.  Construction of an elevated patio deck, fence, or similar structure on private property; or 
c.  Installation of retaining walls, tree wells, terraces or other landscaping which will not alter the general character of the site or increase erosion potential; or 
d.  Construction of streets, other public ways, culverts or bridges as part of an approved subdivision plat or planned development, where necessary to provide good access and circulation; or 
e.  Slope stabilization or site drainage improvements necessary to reduce flood risk, soil erosion, and other hazards to safety and property. 
D.  Erosion and Sedimentation Control Requirements. On-site erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating cleaning, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site. These control measures are: 
1.  For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all offsite runoff as specified in referenced handbooks (Appendix E). Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
2.  For disturbed area drainage more than one but less than five acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
3.  For disturbed areas draining more than five acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
4.  Sediment basin and sediment trap designs shall provide for both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage, and each shall be sized for the two-year, twenty-four-hour runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
5.  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, a sediment removal schedule shall be required. 
6.  Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten-year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within forty-eight hours, consistent with the following standards: 
a.  For grades up to four percent, seeding in combination with mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel. 
b.  For grades of four to eight percent, sod or an equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel. 
c.  For grades greater than eight percent, rock, riprap or an equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
7.  Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or nonvegetative measures. 
b.  Areas having slopes greater than 12% shall be stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent. 
8.  Land disturbance activities in stream channels, ravines and bluffs shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel, ravine or bluff to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
b.  The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within forty-eight hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped. 
c.  Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted. 
d.  Tree protection shall be installed prior to the beginning of the land disturbing activity and erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
9.  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted standards and specifications. 
10.  Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than twenty-five feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles. 
11.  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent. 
12.  Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
13.  All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their intended function. 
14.  All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
15.  For developments disturbing one acre or more of land a "Notice of Intent" must be filed with the IEPA for inclusion in the NPDES Permit ILR10, and a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) must be submitted for review. The SWPPP must meet the following requirements: 
a.  Minimum design level unless otherwise specified by more stringent regulations shall be a storm event equal to or greater than a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
b.  For each measure identified in the plan, the SWPPP must clearly identify the contractor that will implement the measure, and all contractors and subcontractors shall sign the following certificate (include in the SWPPP): 
    "I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the general National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (ILR10) that authorizes the stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification." 
c.  The above certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site, and the date of the certification. 
d.  The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of the NPDES ILR10 permit and with the requirements of the SWPPP. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. Proper operation and maintenance requires the operation of backup or auxiliary facilities or similar systems, installed by a permittee only when necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. 
e.  Inspection by permitee is required at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is half inch or greater or five inches or greater in snowfall. Based on inspection results, modification shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the plans within seven calendar days. The inspection report shall summarize scope of inspection, names of qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the dates of the inspection, and major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP. These records shall be retained as part of the SWPPP for at least three years from the date that the permit coverage expires or is terminated. 
f.  Upon completion of the project a "Notice of Termination" must be filed with the IEPA. 
E.  Handbooks Adopted by Reference.

The standards and specifications contained in Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control ("the Yellow Book") and the Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control ("the Green Book") are incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans approved under this ordinance. In the event of conflict between provisions of the Yellow Book and the Green Book and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern. 
2.  Use of the Technical Manual Designed for Urban Ecosystem Protection and Enhancement (Illinois Urban Manual), 2002 or latest edition, prepared for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, is made a part hereof by this reference, for purposes of exemplifying the considerations and factors which should enter into preparation of a soil erosion control plan and SWPPP. 
F.  Maintenance of Control Measures. All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet with requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance. 
G.  Inspections. 
1.  The Building Official, Planning and Economic Development Director, or Village Engineer shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the Village shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. 
2.  If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five working days after notice is received by the village from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without presuming acceptance by the Village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the site. 
3.  In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit, and this chapter, the permittee shall notify the Village Engineer within two working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below: 
a.  Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading; 
b.  After stripping and clearing; 
c.  After rough grading; 
d.  After final grading; 
e.  After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and 
f.  After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of sediment controls. 
H.  Special Precautions. 
1.  If a Village official determines by inspection that any grading work authorized by an existing permit imperils any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland or drainage structure, the village may require, as a condition of the work that reasonable special precautions be taken to avoid such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work. 
2.  Where it appears that storm or other damage may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village engineer or building and zoning administrator may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
I.  Amendment of Plans. Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the building and zoning administrator or village engineer and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the village engineer or building and zoning administrator by written authorization to the permittee.

7.  All testing and chlorination shall be done before the installation of service lines. 
C.  Preliminary Flushing. 
1.  Prior to chlorination, the main shall be flushed thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and outlets available. The Village Engineer shall be notified before any water is drawn from Village mains, and only Village Public Works employees shall operate filling valves. 
2.  Flushing shall be done after the pressure test is made. Flushing shall affect a velocity in the main of at least 21/2 feet per second. 
3.  Corporation stops shall be provided at the end of dead end mains without hydrants to allow for flushing and chlorination. 
D.  Disinfection. 
1.  The preferred point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved section of it and through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid pipe. The injector for delivering the chlorine gas into the pipe should be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline extension. 
2.  Water from the existing distribution system or any other source of supply shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline during the application of chlorine-gas. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least 50 parts-per-million, or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period. 
3.  Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in the line being treated shall not flow back into the line supplying the water. The pipe section being chlorinated shall be kept at a lower pressure than the water system pressure. 
4.  Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough to destroy all spore-forming bacteria. This retention period shall be at least 24-hours. After the chlorine-treated water has been retained for the required time, the chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other representative points shall be at least 25 parts-per-million. 
5.  In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the chlorinating agent. 
6.  All water mains shall be disinfected and tested according to the requirements of the Standards for Disinfecting Water Mains, AWWA C-601, and as required by this Section. All disinfection, as required by this Section, shall be performed by an independent firm exhibiting experience in the methods and techniques of this operation, and shall be approved by the Village Public Works Department. 
E.  Final Flushing and Testing. 
1.  Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the replacement water, throughout its length, upon test, has a CL 2 residual of typical supply water or less. 
2.  The sample tap shall be located and installed in such a way as to prevent outside contamination. Samples should never be taken from a non-sterilized hose or from a fire hydrant because such samples seldom meet current bacteriological standards. 
3.  After final flushing and before any new water main is connected to the distribution system, two consecutive sets of acceptable samples, taken 24 hours apart, shall be collected from the new main. At least one set of samples shall be collected from every 1,200 feet of the new water main, plus one set from the end of the line and at least one set from each branch, with notice given, so that the collection may be witnessed by the Public Works Department. 
4.  Bacterial sampling and analysis of the samples shall be performed by a laboratory approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Public Works Department. 
5.  Should the initial treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacterial test, the procedure shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. 
6.  The contractor or developer shall pay for the sampling and analysis. Results shall be transmitted by the laboratory directly to the Village Public Works Department. Test results shall indicate the date the sample was made, the exact locations at which samples were taken, the firm submitting the sample, and the project at which the samples were collected. Sufficient samples shall be collected in order to ensure that the system is bacterially safe. 
7.  The Public Works Department shall operate the valves, hydrants, and any other appurtenances to flush the water main after the receipt of satisfactory water samples. Any operation difficulties or deficiencies shall be noted and submitted to the developer or contractor for repair. 
F.  Record Drawings. 
1.  Prior to final acceptance of work, record drawings shall be submitted to the Village Engineer. Elevations and locations of all fittings and utility crossings shall be recorded. 
2.  Two sets of record drawings shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for review. Once approved, one Mylar reproducible and one electronic copy in AutoCAD 20004 (or approved equal), and four paper copies shall be submitted. 
3.  Update of Village system maps based on final record drawings shall be arranged by the Village Engineer at the expense of the developer.
