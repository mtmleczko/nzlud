PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Glastonbury, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through June 8, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 8 is 8-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 8-2 and 8-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-2.1, 8-2.2 and 8-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 11 and 12 it will be designated as Chapter 11.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATUTORY REFERENCE TABLE SRT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Bonnie Mitchell, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Joyce P. Mascena, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

PART I - THE CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Town Charter in its current form was first adopted October 5, 1959. It appears herein as amended. Those sections that have been amended by the Charter revisions of November 2, 1982, bear that date in a history note following the section. The Charter Comparative Table lists all previous amendment dates and traces the amendments to the Charter beginning with the revision of November 2, 1982. 
A uniform style of punctuation, capitalization and format on the page has been employed, to conform the appearance of the Charter to that of the Code. No substantive changes have been made. 

CHAPTER I. - INCORPORATION AND GENERAL POWERS 

Sec. 101. - Incorporation. 
    All the inhabitants dwelling within the territorial limits of the Town of Glastonbury, as the same now are or may hereafter be established by law, shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name of "Town of Glastonbury," hereinafter called "the town" and as such shall have perpetual succession and may hold and exercise all powers and privileges heretofore exercised by said town and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter, the additional powers and privileges herein conferred, and all powers and privileges conferred upon towns under the general statutes of the State of Connecticut. 
Sec. 102. - Transition. 
    The rights and duties of the municipal corporation known as the Town of Glastonbury shall remain as if this Charter had not been adopted, with the exception of such regulations and restrictions as are contained in this Charter.

Sec. 103. - General grant of powers. 
    The town shall have, in addition to the powers specifically granted by this Charter, all powers vested in the town or any officer, board or commission thereof at the effective date of this Charter, all powers fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted herein, and all other powers incident to the management, government and affairs of the town, including all powers now or hereafter conferred upon the towns or town by general statutes or special acts of the State of Connecticut and also including the power to enter into contracts with the United States Government, the State of Connecticut, or any political subdivision thereof for services and the use of facilities, the exercise of which is not expressly forbidden by the Constitution of the United States of America or the Constitution and general statutes of the State of Connecticut. The council may contract for services and the use of facilities of the United States or any federal agency, the State of Connecticut and any political subdivision thereof, or may by agreement join with any such political subdivision to provide services and facilities; however, any commitment by the council for the town to participate in any metropolitan, regional or municipal governmental body to which the town's control over its municipal services is transferred in whole or in part, regardless of the town's representation therein, may only be given by the council by ordinance.

Sec. 302. - Organization. 
    The organizational meeting of the new council shall be held within one week following its election. The meeting shall be called to order by the town clerk who shall administer the oath of office to all members, provided that in the absence of the town clerk the meeting may be called to order and the oath administered by any citizen of Glastonbury authorized by law to administer oaths. The council shall then proceed to election of a chairman and vice-chairman to serve for the ensuing two (2) years but such offices shall not deprive such chairman or vice-chairman of his vote on any question. 
    The chairman of the council shall preside over all meetings of the council and perform such other duties consistent with his office as may be imposed by the council. During his absence or disability his duties shall be performed by the vice-chairman of the council. In the event both the chairman and the vice-chairman are absent or unable to perform their duties, such duties shall be performed during the period of their absence or disability by a member chosen by the council. The chairman or acting chairman of the council shall be the ceremonial head of the town government. 
Sec. 303. - Other offices. 
    During the time for which he is elected, no member of the council shall hold any other office, elective or appointive, or employment in or under the town government except by virtue of a federal statute. 
Sec. 304. - Procedure. 
    At the organizational meeting the council shall fix the time and place of its regular meetings and provide by resolution a method of calling a special meeting. The council shall determine its own rules of procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter. All meetings of the council for the transaction of business shall be open to the public unless by an affirmative vote of seven (7) members present the council shall vote that any particular session shall be an executive session. The presence of five (5) members shall constitute a quorum, but no ordinance, resolution or vote, except a vote to adjourn or to fix the time and place of its next meeting, shall be passed by less than five (5) affirmative votes. The affirmative and negative votes on each matter considered by the council shall be recorded as prescribed by the general statutes. No ordinance or resolution shall be passed or appointment or removal made except at a meeting of the council open to the public. 
    The council shall appoint a clerk of the council who shall receive compensation as fixed by the council. Such clerk shall keep a public record of the proceedings of all regular and special meetings of the council, including all roll call votes, which record shall be kept in the town clerk's office. The record so kept shall be authenticated for each meeting by the signature of the chairman or acting chairman. 
Sec. 305. - Definition and introduction of ordinances and resolutions. 
    All ordinances and resolutions except those relating to appointment or designation of officers of the council or its internal procedure shall be introduced in written form. All ordinances and resolutions shall when practicable be confined to one subject which shall be clearly stated in the title. It shall be the duty of the clerk of the council within one week following introduction of such written resolutions and ordinances to prepare at least ten (10) copies of each such proposed resolution and/or ordinance, one copy of which shall be filed in the town clerk's office for public inspection and one copy to be posted in a public place in the town office building. 
    No ordinance or resolution shall be considered at any special meeting, notice of which has not been included in the call or the agenda for such meeting. 
    For purposes of this Charter, an ordinance shall be defined as a municipal legislative enactment which prescribes a permanent rule of conduct. 
    For purposes of this Charter, a resolution shall be defined as an administrative act which is intended to be of a temporary or terminable character. 
Sec. 306. - Public hearing on and publication of ordinances and resolutions. 
    At least one public hearing, five (5) days' notice of which shall be given by publication in a newspaper having a substantial continuous circulation in the town, shall be held by the council before any ordinance or resolution making a nonbudgeted appropriation of more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) shall be passed. Such notice need not publish in full the proposed ordinance or resolution, but in lieu thereof may identify it by title and summarize its provisions. After such public hearing, the council may make such nonsubstantive changes and amendments to the ordinance or resolution as it may deem advisable before passage. Every ordinance shall be given a serial number and be recorded by the town clerk in a book to be kept for that purpose which shall be properly indexed. Within ten (10) days after passage of such an ordinance or resolution, it shall be published once in a newspaper having a substantial, continuous circulation within the town and may be identified by title and with a summary of its provisions in lieu of being published in full, and such ordinance or resolution shall become effective ten (10) days after publication. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to resolutions relating to the appointment or designation of officers of the council or its internal procedure, or requiring approval by referendum vote as provided in section 312. 
Sec. 307. - The council, general powers and duties. 
    The legislative power of the town shall be vested exclusively in the council, except as otherwise provided for in the sections of this chapter pertaining to initiative and referendum. The final authority concerning the budget shall be vested exclusively in the council. 
    The council shall have all the rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred by law upon the town meeting, except as otherwise provided in Chapter VII of this Charter. 
    The council shall appoint the town manager and shall supervise all of his activities. 
    The council may authorize the manager to contract for services and the use of facilities of any federal agency or any state agency and any political subdivision thereof, or may, by agreement, join with any such political subdivisions to provide services and facilities. Departments and offices created by this Charter, the functions of which are transferred under the terms of such contract or agreement, may by ordinance be abolished. 
    The council shall have power to make, alter, and repeal ordinances or resolutions consistent with this Charter and the general statutes for the execution of the powers vested in it by this Charter, for the government of the town and the management of its business and for the preservation of the good order, peace, health, and safety of the town and its inhabitants. 
    The council is authorized to incorporate, by ordinance, any nationally recognized code, rules or regulations that have been printed in book form, or any code officially adopted by any administrative agency of the state, or any portion thereof, by reference thereto in such ordinance; provided upon passage of any such ordinance wherein any such code, rules and regulations have been incorporated by reference, there shall be maintained two (2) copies of such code, rules and regulations in the office of the town clerk for examination by the public. 
    The council may regulate the internal operation of boards, commissions, committees, and offices which it fills by appointment. The compensation of each administrative department head and of each administrative officer shall be fixed by the council. The charges, if any, to be made for services by the town, for the execution of powers vested in the town as provided in Chapter I of this Charter or for the government of the town and of its business, shall be fixed by the council. 
    Except as otherwise provided in the general statutes, the council shall have the power to enact, amend or repeal any building or zoning ordinance, provided no such ordinance shall be enacted, amended or repealed, nor any public hearing held thereon, until the council shall have received a recommendation thereon from the town plan and zoning commission, or until thirty (30) days shall have elapsed after the council has requested such a recommendation from such commission. 
    In enacting zoning regulations the council shall adhere to the procedural requirements of section 8-3 of the general statutes, or as the same may be amended, rather than the enactment procedures of this Charter. 
(11-2-82) 
Sec. 308. - Investigations. 
    The council shall have power to investigate any and all departments, offices and agencies of the town and for such purposes shall have the power to call witnesses to appear before the council on any matter under investigation. Any officer or employee of the town who, upon receipt of adequate notice and opportunity, fails to appear when so called by the council shall be deemed to resign thereby from such office or position. 
Sec. 309. - Relations with administrative officers and employees. 
    Neither the council nor any of its members shall direct or request the appointment of any person to any office or employment which office or employment, by the provisions of this Charter, the manager or any of his appointees are empowered to fill by appointment, provided the manager may seek advice from the council regarding appointments and provided further the council may prefer charges in writing against any officer or employee appointed by the manager in the manner prescribed in section 1002 of this Charter for the removal of officers and employees. The council and its members shall deal with the administrative service solely through the manager and neither the council nor any member thereof shall give orders to any of the subordinates of the manager either publicly or privately, provided a properly constituted meeting of the council, which the manager has been invited to attend, may call before it any employee or officer for the purposes of investigation. Violation of the provisions of this section shall be considered grounds for censure. 
Sec. 310. - Annual audit. 
    The council shall annually designate an independent public accountant or firm of independent public accountants to audit the books and accounts of the town as provided in the general statutes. 
Sec. 311. - Emergency ordinances or resolutions. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 306, an ordinance or a resolution stated to be a public emergency measure and stating the facts constituting such public emergency shall become effective immediately upon passage; provided, however, that such emergency ordinance shall be published at the earliest practicable time.

To avoid an actual or perceived conflict, officials are strongly discouraged from appearing before the agency on which they are a member or officer, absent extenuating circumstances, unless s/he has received a prior favorable advisory opinion by the ethics commission prior to appearing. 
(e)  Nothing in the code shall be interpreted to authorize conduct restricted or prohibited by any provision of the Connecticut General Statutes including, but not limited to, G.S. §§ 8-11, 8-21, and 22a-42(c) that restrict conduct of members of municipal zoning and planning authorities and members of wetlands and watercourses boards or commissions.

If the commission decides to so act, it shall state its reasons. 
(4)  Confidentiality.

b.  The commission will meet one (1) or more times in closed session from which the public is excluded to review the inquiry and to determine whether or not there exists probable cause that the code has been violated. In those sessions, it may decide to: (1) seek additional information, (2) create a subcommittee of at least two (2) commission members to make a recommendation for consideration by the full commission, (3) proceed to investigate the relevant facts and issues in order to render a decision, (4) decline to review the matter further, pursuant to subsection (c)(5) hereof, (5) endeavor to resolve the matter by convening a confidential meeting that includes the individual who is the subject of the inquiry and others relevant to the issue, (6) make a finding of probable cause and treat the matter as a complaint under subsection (d) hereof, and/or (7) make a finding of no probable cause. If the commission proceeds under steps (1), (2), (3), or (5) above, it will establish a schedule of meetings for consideration of the inquiry, subject to the provisions of subsection (c)(4)a. hereof. 
c.  A finding of probable cause means that based on a review of the available information the commission determines that reasonable grounds exist to believe that the respondent engaged in prohibited conduct outlined in sections 2-60 through 2-66 of the code. 
(5)  The commission may decline to continue to review a matter on any of these grounds: 
a.  The alleged facts do not evidence the existence of probable cause of a violation of sections 2-60 through 2-66 of the code.

a.  As expeditiously as possible but in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the meeting at which the town clerk received the inquiry form, the commission will decide that (1) the inquiry requires no further action because it was resolved or did not require further review under subsection (c)(5) hereof, or (2) probable cause exists that a violation of the code occurred, in which case the inquiry will be treated as a complaint under subsection (d) hereof. The commission may extend the time for decision if circumstances justify a delay. 
b.  No finding of the existence of probable cause may be made except upon the vote of at least four (4) members of the commission. 
c.  Within five (5) business days after making a decision under this subsection (c), the commission will inform in writing both complainants and respondents of its decision and its reasons for the decision. It shall be sufficient that the commission cite as a reason for its decision any of the reasons enumerated in section 2-69(c)(5), above. 
(7)  Confidentiality. 
a.  If the commission does not make a finding of probable cause, then the inquiry and the record of the commission's investigation shall remain confidential, except upon the request of the respondent. If the inquiry alleged violations by multiple respondents, then the request to release information must be made by all respondents. 
b.  The commission may publish decisions in whole or in part if it decides that publication would serve the public interest and publication can be made in such a way as to protect the personal identity and privacy of persons who were the subject of any evaluation of a possible violation of the code. 
(d)  Complaints. 
(1)  Initiation. 
a.  After conducting an investigation of any inquiry under subsection (c) hereof, if the commission finds probable cause exists, then it will make public by providing to the town clerk its findings and its record of the investigation not later than five (5) business days after its decision, except it may postpone public release of the record for up to fourteen (14) days for the purpose of resolving the matter with the person who is the subject of the inquiry. If no resolution is reached, the commission will proceed in the manner described in this subsection (d). 
b.  The findings and record of the investigation shall include: (1) the inquiry; (2) evidence received or considered; (3) a reference to the particular section of the code involved; and (4) a short and plain statement of the commission's reason for finding probable cause. 
c.  Any member of the public who desires to file a complaint against a current officer, official, consultant or employee for allegedly violating the Code must first pursue the matter as an inquiry under subsection (c) hereof. 
(2)  Public hearings. If the commission decides, after its investigation under subsection (c) hereof, that probable cause of a violation of the code exists, it will conduct a public hearing to determine whether or not a violation occurred. At the hearing, the person who is the subject of the hearing will have the right to be represented by legal counsel, to present evidence and witnesses and compel attendance of witnesses and the production of books, documents, records and papers, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses and inspect and copy relevant and material records, papers and documents not in such person's possession. Not later than ten (10) days before the start of the hearing, the commission will provide the person with a list of its intended witnesses. The commission will make a record of the proceedings. 
(3)  Powers and conduct of hearings. 
a.  For the hearing, the commission will have the power to administer oaths, question witnesses, consider oral and documentary evidence, subpoena witnesses under procedural rules adopted by the commission as regulations in accordance with the provisions of G.S. ch. 54 (Uniform Administrative Procedure Act) to compel attendance before the commission, and require the production for examination by the commission of any books and papers which it deems relevant in any matter under investigation or in question. 
b.  The commission may require witnesses to testify under oath administered by the presiding officer or any other duly qualified person. The hearings shall be recorded and/or transcribed. 
c.  Hearings are not governed by the legal rules of evidence and any information relevant to the matter may be considered. The commission will respect the rules of privilege recognized by the law. When a hearing will be expedited and the interests of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be received in written form. Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts, if the original is not readily available, and, upon request, parties and the commission will be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original. 
(4)  Decisions. 
a.  Decisions by the commission that a person is in violation of the code must result from the concurring vote of four (4) of its members.

(Ord. of 10-23-84, § 6) 
Sec. 8.5-7. - Same-Authority of commission. 
(a)  Regulations. The commission hereby is empowered to adopt from time to time, and shall adopt, not later than six (6) months after its initial members are appointed, regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall have the authority and act in all respects as permitted by G.S. §§ 7-147a through 7-147k, inclusive, as amended, and such other statutes as may be adopted hereafter by the Connecticut General Assembly to amend, supersede or supplement the foregoing statutes. 
(b)  Definitions; criteria. For the purposes of this section, the word "structure" means and includes any building, structure or other physical betterment of real property and the word "construction" means and includes construction, erection, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of any structure. No structure shall be constructed within the historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been approved by the commission. "Exterior architectural features" shall include only the location, architectural style, general design and general arrangement of such portion of the exterior of a building structure or physical betterment as is open to view from a public road, way or place. "Exterior architectural features" shall not include alterations or renovations to the rear exterior of a building, structure or physical betterment which is not open to view from a public road, way or place. In passing upon appropriateness, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture and material of the exterior architectural features involved and the relationship of such to the exterior architectural system and pertinent features of the surroundings, including other structures in the immediate neighborhood. A certificate of appropriateness may be refused for any structure construction of which, in the opinion of the commission, would be detrimental to the interests of the historic district, unless as a result of such action the owner of such structure will be deprived of reasonable use of the structure. When a certificate of appropriateness is denied, the commission shall place upon its records and in the notice to the applicant the reasons for its determination, and to the extent practical, the commission shall identify what changes or modifications might be undertaken by the applicant in order to obtain approval of a new application. The style, material, size and location of fences, outdoor signs or similar devices within a historic district shall be under the control of the commission. 
(c)  Exclusions. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to extend to (i) the color of material used or (ii) the use of aluminum or vinyl exterior siding in lieu of wood clapboard siding on the exterior of any structure within the district. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature which does not involve a change of design or appearance thereof. In addition, in its deliberations the commission shall not consider arrangement or use of the interior of any improvement and shall take no action except for the purpose of preventing the construction of a structure obviously incongruous with the historical and aesthetic aspects of the other structures in the historic district. 
(d)  Application for certificate of appropriateness. An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the commission through the office of community development (or whatever town agency or official is then performing the functions of such body). For purposes of this chapter, the office of community development shall require the applicant to provide such information on those forms devised by the commission as may be adopted or modified from time to time by the commission. Prior to considering each application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall set a date for a public hearing to be held within thirty-five (35) days of receipt of a completed application. 
(e)  Hearing on application. Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall be given by publication in the form of a legal advertisement, at least twice at intervals of not less than two (2) days, appearing in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the municipality. The first such advertisement shall be no more than fifteen (15) days nor less than ten (10) days and the second not less than two (2) days before such hearing. Within sixty (60) days of the filing of an application, the commission shall act upon such application and shall give written notice of its decision to the applicant. Failure to act within sixty (60) days after receipt of a completed application shall constitute approval of the application. All hearings and all meetings of the commission shall be open to the public. 
(f)  Plan of appropriateness and protection. Within twelve (12) months after its initial members are appointed, the commission shall prepare, and update as necessary from time to time thereafter, a plan of appropriateness and protection for the historic district, as a standard by which to determine the appropriateness of historic exterior architectural features of any structure or of any modification of an existing structure within the district. The plan shall comprehend construction materials and architectural arrangements considered appropriate for the district, to be illustrative but not necessarily comprehensive or extensive and to serve as a general guide for the information of persons contemplating work involving historic exterior architectural features within the district. Copies of the plan shall be available to the public in the office of community development. 
(g)  How to construe chapter. The provisions of this chapter are separable from and in addition to whatever provisions of the zoning laws of the town also may affect any structure or use thereof within the district. 
(h)  Exceptions for public safety; "grandfathering." Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the erection or alteration of any such feature which the building inspector or a similar agent certifies is required by the public safety because of a condition which is unsafe or dangerous due to deterioration; nor to prevent the erection or alteration of any such feature under a permit issued by a building inspector or similar agent prior to the effective date of the establishment of such district.

Any funds collected as fines pursuant to this section shall be used by the commission to restore the affected buildings, structures, or places to their condition prior to the violation wherever possible and any excess shall be paid to the town treasury. 
(Ord. of 10-23-84, § 9) 
Sec. 8.5-10. - Maintenance of properties. 
(a)  Every owner of a structure within the historic district shall maintain such in good order and repair. It is the intent of this chapter that the objectives hereof will best be achieved by way of voluntary compliance between the owner of an affected premises and the commission. 
(b)  Where premises are included within the historic district, the issued valuation of such premises after the formation of such district shall take into account the limitations upon use or improvement of the premises and the unique or extraordinary expenses, if any, necessarily incurred by an owner in maintaining the structure. 
(c)  In any case where the commission deems an owner to be in violation of this section, it shall submit to the owner a specification of the violations and allow the owner an appropriate amount of time to remedy such violations.

    Any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the commission shall have the power, pursuant to G.S. § 7-147g, to waive or vary compliance with any of the provisions of the chapter or to waive the institution of enforcement proceedings if such compliance or enforcement proceedings would result in the depreciation of reasonable use of the structure by the owner thereof or otherwise result in undue hardship to the owner of the structure. No such waiver or variance shall be granted until after a written request, detailing the basis upon which the claim of hardship is made, has been made to the commission by the person seeking such waiver or variance and a public hearing held by the commission within forty-five (45) days thereafter. No waiver or variance may be granted for construction of a structure initiated without compliance with the requirements of this chapter, that is, construction initiated before the commission has held a public hearing and acted upon the certificate of appropriateness or waiver requested, as the case may be, with respect to such structure.

Sec. 9-208. - Penalties and enforcement; appeals. 
(a)  After the final date set for the correction of any violation pursuant to section 9-206 herein or at any time within twelve (12) months from the expiration of the final period for the uncontested payment of fines, penalties, costs or fees for any citation issued under this article for an alleged violation hereof, the town manager shall send notice to the person cited via certified mail. Such notice shall inform the person cited: 
(1)  Of the allegations against him and the amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees due; 
(2)  That he may contest his liability before a citation hearing officer by delivering in person or by mail written notice within ten (10) days of the date thereof; 
(3)  That if he does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and judgment shall be entered against him; and 
(4)  That such judgment may issue without further notice. 
    For purposes of this section, notice shall be presumed to have been properly sent if such notice was mailed to such person's last-known address on file with the tax collector. If the person to whom such notice is issued is a registrant, the town may deliver such notice in accordance with G.S. § 7-148ii, provided nothing in this section shall preclude the town from providing notice in another manner permitted by applicable law. 
(b)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to an official designated by the town manager. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten (10) days of the date of the first notice provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the town manager or the town manager's designee shall certify such person's failure to respond to the citation hearing officer. The citation hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances and shall follow the procedures set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(c)  Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the citation hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the town manager or the town manager's designee shall be filed and retained by the town, and shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of G.S. § 52-180 and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the person who issues the initial notice of violations shall be required at the hearing if such person receiving such notice so requests. A person wishing to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his behalf. A designated municipal official, other than the citation hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the town. If such person fails to appear, the citation hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The citation hearing officer may accept from such person copies of police reports, investigatory and citation reports, and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The citation hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The citation hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that the person is not liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he determines that the person is liable for the violation, he shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against such person as provided by this article. 
(d)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the citation hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than thirty (30) days or more than twelve (12) months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of a superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator together with an entry fee of eight dollars ($8.00). The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one (1) record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and court costs of eight dollars ($8.00), against such person in favor of the town. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the citation hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person. 
(e)  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to G.S. § 52-259, at a superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the superior court.

( Ord. No. 325, 9-11-12 ) 
Sec. 15-101. - Citation appeal and hearing process. 
(a)  The town, at any time within twelve (12) months from the expiration of the final period for the uncontested payment of fines for any citation issued pursuant to this chapter, for an alleged violation thereof, shall send notice to the person cited. Such notice shall inform the person cited: 
(1)  Of the allegations against the person and the amount of fines due; 
(2)  That the person may contest his or her liability before a citation hearing officer by delivering in person or by mail written notice within ten (10) days of the date thereof; 
(3)  That if the person does not demand such a hearing, an assessment and judgment shall be entered against him or her; and 
(4)  That such judgment may issue without further notice. 
(b)  If the person to whom such notice is issued is a registrant, the town may deliver such notice in accordance with G.S. § 7-148ii, provided nothing in this section shall preclude the town from providing notice in another manner permitted by applicable law. 
(c)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, he or she may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines due either in person or by mail to the town's collector of revenue. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing within ten (10) days of the date of the first notice provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to have admitted liability, and the ZEO shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines provided for by this chapter and shall follow the procedures set forth in this section. 
(d)  Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the ZEO shall be filed and retained by the town, and shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of G.S. § 52-180 and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the ZEO shall be required at the hearing if such person so requests. A person wishing to contest his or her liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence on his or her behalf. The town manager shall designate a municipal official(s), other than the hearing officer, who may present evidence on behalf of the town. If such person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and liability as provided for in this chapter. The hearing officer may accept from such person copies of police reports, investigatory and citation reports, and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he or she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end of the hearing. If he or she determines that such person is not liable, he or she shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he or she determines that such person is liable for the violation, he or she shall forthwith enter and assess the fines against such person as provided herein. 
(e)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than thirty (30) days or more than twelve (12) months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of a superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator together with an entry fee for the amount as specified in G.S. § 7-152c(f). The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed as one (1) record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and court costs, against such person in favor of the town. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person. 
(f)  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to G.S. § 52-259, at a superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the superior court. 
( Ord. No. 325, 9-11-12 ) 
Sec. 15-102. - Amount of fines. 
    No fine imposed pursuant to this chapter may exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for each day that a violation of the town's building zone regulations continues. All fines imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be payable to the town's collector of revenue.

Sec. 18-6. - Tax relief for elderly homeowners. 
(a)  [Authority.] Pursuant to the authority granted under G.S. § 12-129n, as amended from time to time, the town hereby authorizes local real property tax relief to eligible residents. The town shall have two (2) tax relief programs, the local credit program described in subsection (b) and the tax deferred program described in subsection (c). The residential property that will be subject to any real property tax relief must be owned by the participant and the participant's principal residence. Residents' eligibility shall be established pursuant to G.S. § 12-129n and administrative procedures established pursuant to subsection (e) below. Participation in the local credit program shall require biennial application. Participation in the tax deferral program shall require an annual application. Eligible residents may apply for and participate in either the local credit program or tax deferral program, but may not apply for or participate in both programs. 
(b)  Local credit program. 
(1)  The local credit program provides a tax credit to be applied towards real property taxes for eligible residents. The local credit program shall be effective with the Grand List of October 1, 2006 for property taxes first payable on July 1, 2007. The maximum income allowable to participate in the local credit program and the local tax credit for the Grand List of October 1, 2005 are set forth in below. The maximum income allowable to participate in the local credit program and the local tax credit shall be adjusted annually as an administrative function performed by the town manager, in accordance with annual income changes to qualify for the state mandated tax relief program under G.S. § 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and 12-170aa and in accordance with this subsection (b). 
(2)  The local tax credit shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the tax increase for the median value of homes owned by participants in the local credit program for the previous Grand List year and July 1 payment date. 
(3)  For a participant in the local credit program which has been the owner of record of real property in town for at least twenty (20) years out of the past twenty-five (25) years immediately preceding the date of application, which property was used as such participant's principal residence for those twenty (20) or more years and is currently being used by such participant as such participant's principal residence, the local tax credit shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) higher for each level of qualifying income. 
(4)  The cost to the town for the local credit program shall not exceed one-half (1/2) percent of the applicable Grand List year current tax levy. 
(5)  The tax relief provided to a taxpayer in the aggregate under the state tax relief program under G.S. § 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and 12-170aa and the local credit program shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the property tax for which such taxpayer would be liable but for the benefits under the state tax relief program and the local credit program. 
(c)  Tax deferral program. 
(1)  The tax deferral program provides for a deferral of real property taxes excluding amounts from state mandated tax credits. Participation in the tax deferral program requires an agreement between the participant and the town.

(1)  To reduce rents below the levels which would be achieved in the absence of abatement; 
(2)  To improve housing quality and design; 
(3)  To effect occupancy by elderly persons of varying income levels, within prescribed limits; or 
(4)  To provide necessary related facilities.

Editor's note- An ordinance of Apr. 28, 1992, §§ 1-11, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Art. III, § 18-31, was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 18-31. - Regulations generally. 
    The town council may abate property taxes on dairy farms and recapture taxes so abated in the event of sale, in accordance with the following procedures and requirements: 
(1)  Any action by the town council concerning the abatement of property taxes for dairy farms, or the recapture of any taxes so abated, is done pursuant to Public Act 90-270, § 35, codified as G.S. § 12-81m, as such statute may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  A request for an abatement must be made by application to the town assessor by the record owner of the property, or a person who is a tenant under a signed lease, which lease (a) is recorded on the land records of the Town of Glastonbury, (b) has a minimum term of three (3) years, and (c) requires the tenant to pay all taxes on the dairy farm. 
(3)  In order for an abatement to apply for the tax year beginning July 1, 1992, the application must be submitted no later than May 15, 1992. For any tax year thereafter, the application must be submitted between September 1 and October 31, of the year preceding the tax due date. Failure to reapply by October 31 of each year will result in loss of the abatement for that year. 
(4)  An abatement is only available for "dairy farm." The applicant must provide the town council with evidence to support the status of the farm as a "dairy farm." In determining whether a farm is a "dairy farm," the town council shall take into account among other factors: the acreage of the farm; the nature of the barns, other structures, and equipment on the farm; the number and types of livestock on the farm; the quantities of milk sold by the farm; the gross income of the farm derived from dairy-related activities; the gross income of the farm derived from other types of activities and evidence of dairy farm or milk producing permit or dairy plant or milk dealer permit, as G.S. § 22-172 or G.S. § 22-173. 
(5)  The town council may abate up to fifty (50) percent of the property taxes for the real property and outbuildings used for the production of milk or feed for dairy animals. 
(6)  Any abatement will continue in force, so long as permitted by state law, until such time as the town council modifies or revokes the abatement, until such time as the farm is sold, or until such time as the farm ceases to be a "dairy farm," whichever occurs first. 
(7)  The property owner or tenant, as applicable, receiving the abatement must notify the town assessor in writing within thirty (30) days of the sale of the property or the cessation of operations as a "dairy farm." 
(8)  Upon sale or other transfer of the property, and subject to the provisions of subsection (9) herein, the property owner must pay to the town a percentage of the original amount of the taxes abated, pursuant to the following schedule: 
Number of Years Sale Follows 
Abatement for Given Tax Year Percentage of Original Amount of Taxes Abated Which Must Be Paid For Each Year (Percent) More than 10 0 10 10 9 20 8 30 7 40 6 50 5 60 4 70 3 80 2 90 1 100  
(9)  The town council may waive any of the amounts which would otherwise be owed pursuant to subsection (8) herein if the farm continues to be a dairy farm after the sale of the property. The town council may waive any of the amounts which would otherwise be owed pursuant to subsection (8) herein if the property continues to be used as "farm land," "forest land" or "open space," as those terms are defined in G.S. § 12-107b after the sale of the property. 
(10)  Repayment of the taxes abated and owed to the Town of Glastonbury pursuant to subsections (8) and (9) hereof shall be due and payable by the record property owner/grantor to the town clerk of Glastonbury at the time of recording of his deed or other instrument of conveyance. Such revenue received by the town clerk shall become part of the general revenue of Glastonbury. No deed or other instrument of conveyance which is subject to the recapture of tax, as set forth in subsection (8) hereof, shall be recorded by the town clerk unless the funds due under the recapture provisions of subsection (8) hereof have been paid, or the obligation has been waived pursuant to subsection (9) hereof. 
(11)  The tax assessor shall file annually with the town clerk, not later than thirty (30) days after abatement is approved by the town council, a certificate for any dairy farm land that has been approved for a tax abatement, which certificate shall set forth the date of the initial abatement and the obligation to pay the recapture funds as set forth in subsection (8) hereof. Said certificate shall be recorded in the land records of the Town of Glastonbury.

(1)  To assess such excess cost as an outlet benefit in any district to be served by extensions of such sewer or sewer system being laid out and constructed, such assessment to be levied and payable at the same time as the direct assessments for the sewer system being laid out and constructed; or 
(2)  To pay such excess cost and defer the assessment of such excess costs until such time as the benefits shall be more immediate.

(2)  A sewer connection charge has been paid, or voluntary lien executed and recorded as provided hereafter by or for the owners of the real estate which is to be served by such connection, which payment shall be in lieu of and an amount equal to the assessment on such real estate. 
(b)  Where the water pollution control authority in its judgment determines it would be fair and equitable to do so, prior to such connection the owners of such real estate may be allowed to enter into a special agreement providing that the permission granted to connect will not affect the power of the authority to make future sewer layouts and benefit assessments therefor against the property of such owner in the same manner as if the permission to connect had never been granted by the authority and agreeing to credit such connection charge toward any future assessment, without allowance for interest between the date of payment of such charge and the date of any future final assessment billed such owner.

Sec. 19-209. - Evidence as to purpose of sewer to be used in determining use of sewer. 
(a)  If the proceedings by or under which any public sanitary sewer was laid out, constructed or conveyed to the town described the kinds of wastewaters for which that sanitary sewer was intended, or what wastewaters should be excluded therefrom, said description of the sanitary sewer shall be considered for purposes of determining what wastewaters may be discharged thereinto or shall be excluded therefrom; provided that if the original designation of said sanitary sewer or wastes to be conveyed by it has been legally changed since the original proceedings, such amended classification shall be applicable. 
(b)  If wastes other than those for the conveyance of which a particular sanitary sewer was originally intended have been at any time discharged or conveyed thereby, such discharge shall not constitute any amendment of the originally and formally expressed intended use for the sanitary sewer, unless the original designation shall have been amended by the authority. 
(c)  If the proceedings for the layout and construction of any sanitary sewer or for its acquisition by the town did not indicate what wastes could or could not be discharged therein, the manager or an authorized agent thereof, shall consider the pertinent facts and shall determine what waste or wastewaters shall be permitted to be discharged thereinto or be excluded therefrom in accordance with the provisions of this article. Except as, and until, the determination so made by the manager, or an authorized agent thereof, of the kinds of wastes to be permitted in, or excluded from, any sanitary sewer shall have been altered or changed by the vote of the authority, such determination by the manager or an authorized agent thereof shall control the classification of the kinds of wastes which may be permitted to be discharged thereinto or to be excluded therefrom.

4.11 Flood-Prone Area Regulations F effective 09-26-08
4.11.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to apply special regulations to flood-prone areas in the Town. These special
regulations are designed: (a) to prevent or minimize loss of life and injuries to persons and property and other losses,
both private and public; (b) to promote the health, public safety and general welfare of the community; (c) to help
control and minimize the extent of floods and reduce the impact and occurrence of flooding; (d) to preserve the
floodplain as an environmentally, agriculturally, recreationally, and aesthetically valuable resource; and (e) to
comply with minimum federal floodplain management criteria and to qualify property within the Town for flood
insurance.
4.11.2 Definitions
For the purpose of this Section 4.11 Regulation:
1. Base Flood  the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
2. Base Flood Elevation (BFE)  the elevation of the crest of the base flood or 100-year flood. The height in
relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the
floodplains of coastal and riverine areas.
3. Basement  that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
4. Commission  shall refer to the Town Plan and Zoning Commission of the Town of Glastonbury unless
otherwise stated in these Regulations.
5. Cost  As related to substantial improvements, the cost of any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
alteration, repair or other improvement of a structure shall be established by a detailed written contractors
estimate. The estimate shall include, but not be limited to: the cost of materials (interior finishing
components, structural components, utility and service equipment); sales tax on materials; building
equipment and fixtures, including heating and air conditioning and utility meters; labor; built-in appliances;
demolition and site preparation; repairs made to damaged parts of the building worked on at the same time;
contractors overhead; contractors profit; and grand total. Items to be excluded include: cost of plans and
specifications; survey costs; permit fees; outside improvements such as septic systems, water supply wells,
landscaping, sidewalks, fences, yard lights, irrigation systems, and detached structures such as garages,
sheds, and gazebos.
6. Development  any man-made direct or indirect change to improved or unimproved real estate, including,
but not limited to, erection, placing or altering buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, excavation or drilling operations.
7. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  the federal agency that administers the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP).
8. Flood or Flooding  a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
land areas from either the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation or
runoff of surface waters from any source.
9. Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)  the official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the special flood hazard areas (100-year floodplain) and
the insurance risk premium zones applicable to a community. FIRM published after January 1990 may also
show the limits of the regulatory floodway.
40
10. Flood Insurance Study (FIS)  the official study of a community in which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has conducted a technical engineering evaluation and determination of local
flood hazards, flood profiles and water surface elevations. The Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), which
accompany the FIS, provide both flood insurance rate zones and base flood elevations, and may provide the
regulatory floodway limits.
11. Flood Zone  a floodplain or belt or low ground bordering a river or stream channel which may be
inundated by stream waters as often as once or more each year and as infrequently as once in every one
hundred years.
12. Floodway  the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
(1.0) foot. For the purpose of these regulations, the term Regulatory Floodway is synonymous in
meaning with the term Floodway.
13. Floor  the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement) i.e., top of slab in concrete
slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor
of a garage used solely for parking vehicles.
14. Functionally Dependent Use or Facility  a use or facility that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it
is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities. The term does not include seafood processing facilities, long-term storage, manufacturing,
sales or service facilities.
15. Highest Adjacent Grade (HAG)  the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction
next to the proposed walls of a structure.
16. Historic Structure  any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; (b) certified or
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historic significance of a
registered historic district; (c) individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with
historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or (d)
individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation
programs that have been certified either: (1) by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary
of the Interior of (2) directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
17. Incremental Fill  fill, including any material or structure used for the purpose of changing the elevation or
contour of property subject to these Regulations or which would have the effect of displacing water or
flood storage capacity of the property, proposed to be brought onto the property or deposited, erected or
developed on such property. Shifting of existing contours without the addition of new fill from off-site and
which does not reduce the existing flood storage capacity of the subject property shall not be considered
Incremental Fill.
18. Lowest Floor  the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood
resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor.
19. Manufactured Home  a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and designed to be used with our without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities. Recreational vehicles and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive
days or longer shall be considered manufactured homes for the purpose of this Regulation.
20. Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision  a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two (2) or
more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
41
21. Market Value  market value of the structure (shall be determined by an independent appraisal by a
professional appraiser).
22. Mean Sea Level (MSL)  the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a communitys Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are referenced.
23. New Construction  structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective
date of this Regulation (not the revision date).
24. Recreational Vehicle  a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by
a light-duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
25. Special Flood Hazard Area  the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations
(BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided
on Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified
with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. SFHAs include, but are not necessarily limited
to, the land shown as Zones A, A1-30, AE, AO and AH on a FIRM. The SFHA is also called the Area of
Special Flood Hazard.
26. Start Of Construction  (for other than new construction of substantial improvements under the Coastal
Barrier Resources Act (p.l. 97-348)), includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of the construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns
or any work beyond the stage of excavation or replacement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations of the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
27. Structure  a walled and roofed building which is principally above ground, including a manufactured
home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures.
28. Substantial Damage  damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50%) percent of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
29. Substantial Improvement  any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a
structure, taking place during (the life of a structure) (a one (1) year period), in which the cumulative cost
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure. The market value of the
structure should be (1) the cost approach to appraisal of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or
improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the
purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement
of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.
42
30. Variance  a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management regulation that
allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
31. Violation  failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the communitys
floodplain management Ordinance. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest
floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
32. Water Surface Elevation  that height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988
(or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
coastal or riverine areas.
4.11.3 General Provisions
a. Land to which these Regulations apply:
These Regulations shall apply to all property in the Flood Zone.
b. Basis for Establishing the Boundaries and Elevations of the Flood Zone:

Federal Emergency Management Agency
The Flood Zone shall be clearly designated on the zoning map of the Town. The limits of the Flood Zone
shall include the A-1 through 30 zones, and unnumbered A-zones, designated on the Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
When base flood elevation or floodway data have not been provided, then the Commission shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation of floodway data available from a federal, state or
other source in order to administer the provision of these Regulations. When utilizing data other than that
provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency the following standard applies: Select and adopt
a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be
designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood
43
more than one foot at any one point. The Commission or its designee shall make determinations, where
needed, of the exact location of the boundaries of the limits of the Flood Zone (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions or where recurrenceinterval
flood data is unavailable).
The maps and study are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these Regulations and any
subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this regulation. Since
mapping is legally adopted by reference into the regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive
until such time as a map amendment is obtained.
c. Permits Required; Manufactured Homes (as defined by FEMA) Prohibited:
No development of any property within the Flood Zone shall be permitted except in compliance with the
terms of these Regulations and subject to the terms and conditions of a Permit or Special Permit authorizing
such development. Manufactured homes and manufactured home parks are prohibited in the Flood Zone.
d. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability:
The degree of flood protection required by these Regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Compliance with all provisions of
these Regulations, however, is not intended to insure against actual flood damage to persons or property.
Compliance with the provisions of these Regulations is not to be considered an undertaking by the Town of
Glastonbury to indemnify or otherwise hold harmless any person from damage to person or property
resulting from floods. Larger floods than anticipated by these Regulations can and will occur on occasion.
Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply that land
outside the limits of the specified recurrence-interval flood, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free
from flooding or flood damage. These Regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of
Glastonbury or any subdivision thereof, or any official or employee thereof or member of any Town body
or commission, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damage which may result from
compliance with these Regulations or any administrative decision made thereunder.
4.11.4 Administration
a. Designation of the Town Plan and Zoning Commission:
The Glastonbury Town Plan and Zoning Commission, acting through its staff within the Office of
Community Development, shall be the sole agent for issuance of Permits and Special Permits under these
Regulations. Any application submitted to the Commission shall be referred to the Conservation
Commission for technical review and recommendation. The Commission's Staff, the applicant of any
aggrieved party may petition the Commission, or the Commission on its own motion may determine, to
review any action of the Commission's staff or to hold a public hearing on any application for a Permit or
Special Permit or to direct its staff to take specific action with respect to such application.
b. Permits and Special Permits:
1. Permit and Special Permit Reviews  The Commission or its staff shall review all Permit and
Special Permit applications to determine that the Permit requirements have been satisfied and may
issue Permits and Special Permits in accordance with this Section and Section 4.11.5.
2. All Permit and Special Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine if the proposed
development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area within the Flood Zone. No
Permit or Special Permit may be issued where such development adversely affects the flood
carrying capacity of the area within the Flood Zone. For purposes of these Regulations,
"adversely affects" means that the cumulative effects of the proposed activity or development,
when considered with all other existing and anticipated development, will:
44
i.) raise to any extent the water surface elevation within the Floodway, as that term is
defined in Section 4.11.2e.
ii.) where no floodway exist, raise to any significant extent the water surface elevation to the
100-year recurrence-interval flood. The minimum significant shall mean for this
provision, is not more than one (1) foot increase in base flood (100 year) elevation at any
point along the watercourse with all anticipated and existing development.
iii.) raise the water surface elevation of the 500-year recurrence-interval flood by an amount
likely to endanger persons or property by increasing significantly the flood hazard
affecting the subject property or other property within the Town, whether or not abutting
the subject property.
Proposed activities or development shall be presumed to adversely affect the flood carrying
capacity of the Flood Zone if any Incremental Fill is to be placed on the subject property.
c. Alteration of Watercourses:
The Commission's staff shall notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection prior to authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and shall
submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. In the event such alteration
or relocation is permitted, the Permit or Special Permit shall require that the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse shall be maintained, at no expense to the Town, so that its flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
d. Notification:
The Commission's staff shall notify the Regional Planning Agency and the affected municipality at least 35
days prior to the public hearing if any changes of regulation or use of a Flood Zone will affect an area
within 500 feet of another municipality.
4.11.5 Permit Procedures:
a. Application for a Permit or Special Permit under these Regulations shall be made on forms furnished by the
Commission or its staff and shall include, but shall not be limited to, plans in duplicate (drawn to scale),
showing the location, dimensions, and both existing and proposed contours at 0.5 foot contour intervals of
the subject property, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and such
other information as the Commission or its staff may reasonably request. Specifically, the following
information is required:
1. Each applicant shall submit for filing with the Office of Community Development the actual asbuilt
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures;
2. For all new or substantially improved flood proofed structures, the applicant shall be required to
submit to the Office of Community Development:
a.) Actual as-built elevation (in relation to mean sea level); and
b.) Flood proofing certificates required in Section 4.11.6.
3. Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;
4. Elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which any structure has been flood proofed;
45
5. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the flood proofing methods for
any structures meet the minimum flood proofing criteria in Section 4.11.6;
6. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development and proposed maintenance of such watercourse;
7. Amount of Incremental fill proposed to be deposited;
8. Proof satisfactory to the Commission or its staff that the applicant has received all necessary
federal, state and local permits for the proposed activity or development, including any permit
which may be required under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972 (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1334); and
9. Proof that adequate drainage would be provided, acceptable to the Department of Engineering and
Physical Services, associated with any activity within the Flood Zone.
b. Permitted Uses In Flood Zone:
Land and water areas shall be used and buildings or structures shall be erected, altered, enlarged or used
only for one or more of the uses or use categories listed in the list below of Permit uses and Special Permit
uses and indicated in the F column of the Table of Permitted Uses, subject to such standards as may be
referred to in the list below or in the F column of the Table of Permitted Uses, in the Special Requirements

c. Special Permit Requirements:
The Commission may grant a Special Permit for activities to be performed in the Flood Zone, provided the
46
following special criteria are met, in addition to the information required in the remainder of this Section
for Permits, as demonstrated by supplemental information to be submitted by the applicant:
1. Certification from a civil engineer, registered in the State of Connecticut, that floodway functions
will not be adversely affected by the proposed activity.
2. A favorable report on the engineering design of the project from the Town Engineer/Director of
Physical Services.
3. Preparation and submission by the applicant of an environmental and flood area impact statement
indicating that the proposed activity will not have a significant adverse impact upon the
environment or on the flood storage capacity or flow.
4.11.6 Flood Zone Area Requirements:
a. General Requirements:
The following nonexclusive list of requirements shall be applied to all projects located within the Flood
Zone:
1. Anchoring:
a.) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of any structure.
2. Construction Materials and Methods:
a.) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials
and equipment resistant to flood damage or at an elevation above the base flood
elevation;
b.) All new construction and substantial improvements, including public facilities/utilities
projects, shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
c.) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing air conditioning equipment and other service
facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
3. Utilities:
a.) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system, by appropriate flood proofing or by
elevation above the base flood elevations.
b.) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the system into flood
waters; and
c.) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to the system or
contamination from the system during flooding.
4. Standards for streams without established base flood elevations, floodways and/or flood mapping:
a.) The Town Plan and Zoning Commission shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
including data developed pursuant to Section 4.11.3.b. or 4.11.6.1.d. of these
47
Regulations, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or
other development in Zone A on the Community's Firm meet the standards in Section
4.11.6.b.
b.) In a zone where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is
designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development
(including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one
(1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is
considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
c.) The Town Plan and Zoning Commission may request floodway data of an applicant for
watercourses without FEMA published floodways. When such data is provided by an
applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the
request of the Town or not), the Town shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the
principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the
watercourse.
5. Compensatory Storage: the water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are
tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction, or
substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated
for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless
easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically
comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up
to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project.
Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway
or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
6. Equal Conveyance: within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as
designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting
from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of
the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional
engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any
(0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land
adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be
constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
7. Above-ground Storage Tanks: above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located
outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a
concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral
movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that
does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
8. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone: if any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood
Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure
must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached
additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks
or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet
the standards of the more restrictive zone.
9. Structures in Two Flood Zones: if a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction
standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive
than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached
additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks
48
or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet
the standards of the more restrictive zone.
10. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water: new construction, substantial improvements and
repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located
entirely or partially over water.
b. Specific Requirements:
The following specific requirements shall be applied to all construction activities proposed to be conducted
in the Flood Zone:
1. Residential Construction:
No new residential construction shall be conducted within the Flood Zone. Substantial
improvement of any existing residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the elevation of the 500-year recurrence-interval flood.
No subdivision related construction activities, residential or otherwise, shall be conducted within
the Flood Zone. Base flood elevation data shall be required for subdivision proposals to ensure
that construction activity does not occur within the Flood Zone.
2. Nonresidential Construction:
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other
nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above the level of the 500-year recurrence-interval flood or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall:
a.) Be flood proofed so that below the 500-year recurrence-interval flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
b.) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effect of buoyancy; and
c.) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect who shall review and/or
develop structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards
of practice for meeting the provisions of these Regulations.
3. All new construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed
areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls, specifically:
a.) Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria:
i.) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
ii.) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade;
49
iii.) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions. Other coverings must be designed and certified by an engineer or
approved by the Town Plan and Zoning Commission;
iv.) Electrical, plumbing, and other utilities are prohibited below the base flood
elevation;
v.) Use of the enclosed area shall be limited to parking of vehicles, limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, and access to
the building.
4. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a Flood Zone, shall (i) be on the site for fewer than
180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
c. Deficiencies:
Deficiencies detected by the review of the above listed shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately
and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to
make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
4.11.7 Waivers
1. A waiver can be granted from all or any portion of the requirements of these Regulations after
notice and public hearing before the Commission.
2. Waivers shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
a 100-year recurrence-interval flood would result.
3. Waivers shall only be issued upon a determination that the exception is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Waivers shall only be issued upon:
a.) a showing of good and sufficient cause;
b.) a determination that failure to grant the exception would result in unusual financial or
other hardship to the applicant; and
c.) a determination that the granting of the exception will not result in significant increased
flood heights, any additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing state or
local laws or ordinances.
5. Waivers are normally limited to property having an area, in the aggregate, of one-half acre or less,
but may be issued for larger parcels if the technical justification, in terms of preservation of flood
storage capacity and minimization of flood heights, increases to an extent which is commensurate
with the added risk of granting the exception on the larger lot.
6. Any applicant to whom a waiver is granted shall be given written notice by the Commission's staff
that (i) the issuance of an exception to construct a structure below the base flood level will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all waiver actions.
50
7. Waivers may be issued from all or any portion of the requirements of these Regulations for the
reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historical Places of the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to compliance with the
procedures set forth hereinabove. No renovations or alterations may be made to a historical
structure without due consideration and effort to incorporate design concepts which, while
preserving the historical character of the building, will also serve to reduce the potential for future
flood damage and threat to human life and property.
8. In issuing a waiver, the Town Plan and Zoning Commission shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of these Regulations, and:
a.) the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b.) the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c.) the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner;
d.) the importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e.) the necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent
facility;
f.) the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
g.) the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h.) the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
i.) the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j.) the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
k.) the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems, and streets and bridges. Upon consideration of the factors listed above,
the Town Plan and Zoning Commission may grant a waiver.
Land located in the Flood Zone may be removed from that zone only after is has been demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Commission and the Town Council by an individual or firm considered expert and experienced in
the preparation of hydraulic and hydrologic studies and determination of flood lines, that the area in question is not
prone to the hazards of flooding, following submission and acceptance of favorable reports by the Office of
Community Development and Town Engineer/Director of Physical Services. A Letter of Map Change (either a
Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Amendment) that confirms a property is outside the Flood Zone, from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency shall be required.
The applicant shall submit five (5) copies of the report submitted by the above expert(s), accompanied by a map of
the affected area, duly certified by a professional engineer registered with the State of Connecticut, and prepared to
A-2 standards at 0.5 foot contour intervals. The Commission shall submit two (2) copies of the report to the Federal
Insurance Administration for its approval. Approval of the amendment shall be contingent upon approval by the
Federal Insurance Administration. Effective date of the amendment shall be the date of official notification of
approval by the Federal Insurance Administration.

4.12 Planned Area Development Zone PAD
4.12.0 Purpose
In order to provide a procedure which can relate the type, design, and layout of land development to the particular
site in a manner consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan of the Town of Glastonbury as required by the
zoning law of the State of Connecticut and to insure that the increased flexibility of land development allowed by
this regulation is subject to greater administrative standards and procedures which will require the development
plans submitted hereunder to comport in all respects with the zoning law and standards of the State of Connecticut,
but to encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay; the following regulation is
hereby adopted for application to those areas of land which are to be developed as Planned Area Development.
4.12.1 Definitions
a. Underlying Zone: that zone district existing on the tract at the time of filing the Final Development Plan
pursuant to Section 4.12.4.b of this regulation and to which the tract will revert after a Planned Area
Development Zone is not developed within a time limit established pursuant to 4.12.6a of this regulation.
b. Land Use: The following land uses are recognized and permitted in a Planned Area Development Zone as
may be defined and classified in Section 2 - Definitions, and Section 5 - Table of Permitted Uses, of the
Glastonbury Building - Zone Regulations, limited to those uses specified in Section 4 - Use Regulations,
and Section 5 - Table of Permitted Uses of the Glastonbury Building - Zone Regulations and subject to the
other provision of this regulation; residential (including single-family, two-family and multiple-family
dwellings and detached, semi-detached and attached dwelling units), office, service, trade, manufacturing,
culture, entertainment and recreational, transportation, communication and utility, resource production and
extraction.
4.12.2 Minimum Tract Size
The size of tracts for which application for a Planned Area Development Zone may be made shall be controlled by
the zone classification of the tract, in accordance with the following table:
BUILDING ZONE MAP

not include tracts separated by a town or state highway.
Any tracts of land located in more than one zone must meet the requirements of the zone having the highest
minimum tract size requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum tract size for which an application may be made in a residential zone
for a PAD exclusively for Housing for the Elderly, as those terms are defined in these Regulations, or for a PAD in
the Residence A or Residence AA Zone that devotes 20% or more of its units as Affordable Dwelling Units, as those
terms are defined in these Regulations, is 3.5 acres. Amended - effective August 18, 2011

a. Waiver: Those sections of the Glastonbury Building-Zone Regulations governing: Use Regulations
(Section 4); Table of Permitted Uses (Section 5); Special Regulations (Section 6); Accessory Uses and
Structures (Section 7); Nonconforming Uses (Section 8); Off-street Parking and Truck Loading (Section 9);
and Unified Sign Regulations (Section 10) which conflicts with the Final Development Plan for the
Planned Area Development Zone as approved by the Town Council, shall be deemed to be waived as a
result of such Council approval.
b. Mixed Land Uses: Mixed land uses may be permitted in a Planned Area Development Zone, provided that
in the case of any proposed use or uses in the Planned Area Development Zone which are not permitted in
the underlying zone(s) by Section 4 and Section 5 of these Regulations, the total land area or total gross
floor area (which is greater) of such use or uses shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total land area or
total gross floor area (whichever unit of measurement is used in the first instance) of the Planned Area
Development Zone in the case of any underlying residence zone and twenty percent (20%) of the total land
area or total gross floor area (whichever unit of measurement is used in the first instance) of the Planned
Area Development Zone in the case of any underlying non-residence zone except that the aforementioned
restriction shall not apply to the types of residential units (single-family, two-family, multi-family,
detached, semi-detached, attached) in the case of residential uses when the Planned Area Development is to
be located in an underlying residence zone. No industrial Planned Area Development shall be permitted in
any residential zone, nor shall a residential Planned Area Development be permitted in an industrial zone.

Housing, or Elderly or elderly Congregate Housing. Buildings shall cover a total of not more than onesixth
(1/6) of the land area of the Planned Area Development used or designed, arranged or intended to be
used for other residential uses. In determining such total residential or non-residential use area, buffer
areas and the paved areas of public highways, common drives, and off-street parking lots shall be excluded.
The Town Council may vary and the Town Plan and Zoning Commission may recommend that the Council
vary the one-third (1.3) building coverage requirement for nonresidential uses when in its opinion the
proposed use(s) carries out and it consistent with the intent of this regulation.
55
h. Building Height: No building shall exceed a height of thirty-five (35) feet, except that the Council may
allow buildings to have a greater height when fire fighting feasibility is satisfactory in consideration of the
report submitted by the Fire Marshal under Section 4.12.4.b below, and other information which might be
included in the record.
i. Area Relationships: The proposed Planned Area Development Zone shall relate properly to proposed land
uses, traffic circulation patterns, and utility plans as may be shown in the adopted Town Plan of
Development. The proposed Planned Area Development Zone shall also relate properly to such land uses
and zoning as may exist at the time of the application, and shall protect the property values of surrounding
neighborhoods.
j. Open Space: Open space set aside or established pursuant to the density provisions of this section may be
made available for public use at the option of the applicant and the Council. If not so dedicated, adequate
provisions shall be made for the maintenance and upkeep of such open space, including recreational and
public facilities provided therein, by an organization set up by the developer with the power of obtaining
assessments through enforceable covenants against privately owned land within the development. Nothing
set forth above shall be construed either as a requirement or obligation on the part of the Town of
Glastonbury to make any repairs or improvements to any property subject to these covenant and restrictions
or to enforce any covenant or restriction contained herein.
4.12.4 Procedure and Application
The procedure of making application for and obtaining approval of a Planned Area Development Zone shall be
governed by the laws applicable to all zone changes in the Town of Glastonbury.
At the time of submission of a preliminary proposal, the applicant shall be informed of the schedule of fees on file in
the Town Plan and Zoning Commission office covering the application and its processing including any special
studies required. Such fees, as approved by the Town Council and the Town Manager, shall be paid by the applicant
at the time of submission of the Final Development Plan.
a. Preliminary Development Plan: The applicant shall submit four (4) copies of a Preliminary Development
Plan to the Commission. The Town Plan and Zoning Commission and Town Council, either jointly or
severally, shall hold a public hearing, or hearings as the case may be within sixty (60) days of acceptance of
a complete Preliminary Development Plan. Date of acceptance shall be the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Commission. After receipt of the Preliminary Plan and before public hearing, it shall not be
submitted to any commission or board. The Chairman of the Town Council shall chair the joint hearing on
the Preliminary Development Plan. Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in Glastonbury at least twice at intervals of not less than two (2) days prior to the date of such
hearing, and also sent at least fifteen (15) days before such hearing, and also sent at least fifteen (15) days
before such hearing, by ordinary mail, to owners as appearing on the Assessor's records of land within five
hundred feet of the area to be rezoned. Such notice shall indicate the time, date, and place of said hearing,
the general location of the land involved in the zone change, the type of development, and tat copies of the

the proposed uses, building and major structure layout, road and parking patterns, proposed recreation and
open space, density, architectural style of buildings, the names and owners of property as appearing on the
Assessor's records of land within five hundred (500) feet of the area to be rezoned, and benefits of this
Planned Area Development to the Town. The purpose of this hearing is to receive input from the public
and comment and suggestions from the Commission and Council which would allow the applicant to
decide whether to proceed with the expense of preparation of the Final Development Plan. The applicant
may return for further guidance to a Planned Area development Subcommittee of Commission and Town
Council members. The applicant may make such changes to the Preliminary Development Plan as he
deems appropriate, provided, however, the Commission may within its discretion, if it considers those
changes substantial, require the submission of a new Preliminary Development Plan to a public hearing.
The Town Council or Town Plan and Zoning Commission may approve, approve with stipulations or
disapprove the Preliminary Development Plan. Any opinions or suggestions expressed by members of the
56
Commission or Council as to the Preliminary Development Plan shall be tentative only and shall not hinder
or preclude such members from making an independent judgment as to the Final Plan of Development
based upon all evidence in the record at the time of a final decision.

as it may be affected by the proposed development, including present and anticipated traffic
counts, flow patterns, and capacity analysis of present and proposed interchanges, intersections
and entrances serving the development shall be done by a professional engineer licensed to
practice in the State of Connecticut. In addition, a report on these items and other security-related
items shall be submitted from the Chief of Police.
18. A report from the Fire Marshal on firefighting feasibility of the proposed development.
19. A statement from the Town Sanitarian of the adequacy of solid wastes, disposal, and if no public
sanitary sewers are available, private sewage disposal system.

less than the minimum size permitted by Section 4.12.2a above. Such a stage shall include, to substantially
the same proportion as included in the Final Development Plan, all the public amenities and elements used
as public protection of the surrounding area, and shall be to substantially the same dwelling and building
density as the Final Development Plan. Such a stage shall be capable of complete and self-sufficient
existence without the completion of the final stages. Such plan shall conform to and include the
information required by the Final Development Plan.
The applicant may thereafter submit the Final Development Plan and the Commission's recommendations
thereon as a request for a change in zone to the Town Council.
Such an application for a change in zone to the Town Council with the Final Development Plan shall

4.12.5 Findings Required
Because the intent of his ordinance is to approve PADs only where specified development proposals are approved
simultaneously, the zone change to PAD and the Final Development Plan will be approved or denied as one motion.
The Commission may recommend and the Council may approve the creation of a Planned Area Development Zone
provided that a finding is made that the facts submitted with the application establish that:
a. The standards and conditions of Section 12 of these Regulations have been met.
b. The developer has provided, where appropriate, for the sustained maintenance of the development in
general, and also for the open space in accordance with Section 4.12.3j above.
c. Utilities, drainage and recreational facilities have been so laid out as not to duly burden the capacity of such
facilities, such other facilities presently connected therewith, and such facilities proposed by the adopted
Town Plan of Development and officially adopted master utility plans.
d. The streets and drives will be suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and increased densities will
not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network in the area.
e. The existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the population densities and building intensities.
f. The development will be in keeping with the general interest and spirit of the Glastonbury Building-Zone
Regulations and comprehensive plan.
4.12.6 Phasing
a. The Town Council may establish as a condition of its approval time limits for any development or phases
thereof, such time limits apply to the start and completion of construction of the development or phases
thereof. Such time limits may be revised by resolution of the Town Council, upon application, provided
the Town Council shall find the revision to be in the public interest.
4.12.7 Bonding
a. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the developer shall provide the Town with a performance bond
in a form satisfactory to the Town Manager covering the costs of public improvements unless said public
improvements are bonded under the provisions of the Glastonbury Subdivision Regulations. Said bond
shall be in a sum satisfactory to the Town Manager and shall be conditioned on completion of said public
improvements within two (2) years of the date of issuance of the first such building permit, except that such
59
time limit may be extended by resolution of the Town Council, upon application, provided the Town
Council shall find the extension to be in the public interest.
b. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the Council shall request the developer to provide the Town
with a performance bond covering the cost of facilities common to the entire development, including but
not limited to recreational facilities, club houses, private road, buffer areas, and walkways as specified.
Said bond shall be in a sum satisfactory to the Town Manager and shall be conditioned on the completion
of said common facilities within one (1) year of the date of issuance of the first such certification of
occupancy, except that such time limit may be extended by resolution of the Town Council, upon
application, provide the Town Council shall find the extension to be in the public interest.
c. If a Planned Area Development is to be developed in stages and the Council finds that the common
facilities are divided so that they are approximately evenly distributed over the total number of proposed
stages and that each stage, together with its common facilities, shall be capable of complete and selfsufficient
existence without the completion of the final stages, the Council may allow the developer to
provide the Town with a performance bond covering the cost of facilities common to and contained within
each stage, on a stage-by-stage basis prior to the issuance of a building permit for each stage. Said bond
shall be in a sum satisfactory to the Town Manager and shall be conditioned on the completion of said
common facilities for each stage within one (1) year of the date of issuance of the first certificate of
occupancy for each stage, except that such time limit may be extended by resolution of the Town Council,
upon application, provided the Town Council shall find the extension to be in the public interest.
4.12.8 Changes in Approved Plan
a. Minor changes in an approved Final Development Plan may, with the written approval of the Town
Manager, be made, provided such changes shall not substantially affect the overall architectural and site
design of the Planned Area Development. Such changes shall in no way affect overall density, impact or
nature of the development. Such minor changes may include but are not limited to, the location of catch
basins, manholes, and other technical aspects of drainage, slight alterations of the of the location of roads,
sidewalks, structures or buildings due to unforeseen topographic or geologic features; slight alterations of
finished contours, minor rearrangement of lighting standards, benches, and other incidental street furniture.
If the Town Manager shall have any question as to whether such a proposed change is minor to not, such
change shall require the review and written approval of the Town Council, after receiving a report of its
recommendations from the Town Plan and Zoning Commission.
b. Since the PAD Zone is approved by the Town Council as permitting only that use of those uses as proposed
by the application, a change in an Approved Final Development Plan which is not considered to be a minor
change as permitted in Section 4.12.8a above, shall be considered and processed as a completely new
application for change of zone to PAD.
4.12.9 Site Plan Compliance
a. Prior to the commencement of any site work, the developer shall schedule a job meeting with the Public
Works Department in order to establish construction schedules and procedures. The developer shall be
responsible for notifying all contractors and utility companies involved in the project of this meeting. A
job meeting will not be held unless all affected contractor and utility companies are represented.
b. To ensure strict compliance with the approved Final Development Plan, certified record drawings shall be
reviewed by the Public Works and Community Development Departments. If either of those town agencies
or their designated representatives determine that said improvements do not comply with the Final
Development Plan, the Public Works Department shall notify the developer of such non-compliance and
give the developer a period of Thirty (30) days to remedy the non-compliance. Failure to remedy the noncompliance
to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department and the Office of Community Development
within said thirty-day period shall be sufficient case for revocation of the approval of the Final
Development Plan by the final zoning authority.
60
c. Certified Record Drawings: The developer's engineer shall furnish the developer a complete set of prints
upon which the developer shall incorporate and update the as-built record of all the approved Final
Development Plan work on a continual basis as construction progresses. All surveys, measurements, and
such other data required for the determination of the as-built records of the construction of all work shall be
obtained under the direction of a Connecticut registered land surveyor or professional engineer. These
drawings shall be signed and sealed by the registered land surveyor and/or professional engineer, as to
materials, construction methods and location.
The complete set of prints shall be maintained at the job site at all times, and the developer shall be
responsible for having clearly, neatly, accurately, and promptly recorded thereon, as the work is performed,
the as-built record of the work. Principal dimensions, elevations and such other data as required shall be
recorded for all work. Should there be a question as to the type and amount of data to be recorded, Town
Staff shall be responsible for determining the type of data necessary.
The marked-up prints shall be available for inspection by Town Staff during regular business hours and
shall be corrected immediately if found either inaccurate or incomplete.
At the completion of the project, and before any performance bond held by the Town is released, an entire
set of as-built plans shall be submitted on Mylar to Town Staff for acceptance. The plans shall be signed
and sealed by a Connecticut registered engineer and/or land surveyor.

4.17 ADAPTIVE REDEVELOPMENT ZONE (ARZ) effective September 11, 2012
4.17.1 Purpose
To facilitate the reuse and redevelopment of property containing underutilized or distressed historic buildings that
require renovation/redevelopment and/or environmental remediation. This zone change/site development plan
approval regulation shall apply only to properties that present unique development and redevelopment opportunities
but include particularly challenging building and site conditions requiring a flexible regulation that can permit
innovative development while protecting the general health, safety and welfare. Successful projects will create a
rejuvenated property that contains land and/or building uses consistent with the adopted Plan of Conservation and
Development. Expected benefits would include appropriate environmental remediation, environmental
enhancement and natural resource protection, new economic development and/or housing opportunities and the
adaptive reuse of historic buildings and the preservation of historic property features. Mixed use projects shall be
designed in a manner that ensures consideration of the character of the surrounding and underlying district and its
suitability for the proposed uses and adequate availability of infrastructure and services.
75
4.17.2 Standards
4.17.2 (a) Permitted Land/Building Uses
Residential: Single family, two-family and multiple-family dwellings in detached or attached format
Commercial: Office - general or professional, personal services, restaurants, recreation uses, day care facilities,
health and fitness uses.
A mix of residential and commercial land uses listed above shall be permitted only within underlying non-residential
zoning districts. Only residential uses and day care facilities shall be permitted within underlying residential zones.
4.17.2 (b) Existing Property, Building(s)
To be eligible for a Change of Zone to ARZ and concurrent approval of a Site Development Plan the subject
property shall meet the following standards:
? Shall contain a building(s) with a substantial portion at least 75 years old with a minimum floor area of
7,500 square feet of usable floor area (excluding unfinished basements and attics and incomplete full-sized
floors such as garrets, eaves and any garages, barns, storage buildings or other accessory structure(s)).
? Shall provide for the substantial reuse of a building in a manner that preserves historically relevant and
significant building components and facades and/or significant site features including, but not limited to
such features as stone and brick facades, cornices, lintels, unique architectural features of the historic
period or historic use of the property, stacks, chimneys, mill ponds, dams, waterfalls, hydropower
waterways, environmental and natural features and assets, historical signage, and architectural
embellishments.
? Shall enhance the overall economic sustainability of the property.
? Shall be served by public water and sanitary sewer.
4.17.2 (c) Development Intensity/Parking Calculation
The Floor Area Ratio (FAR = total building floor area between exterior walls/total lot area) in the ARZ shall not
exceed 0.5 unless the FAR of existing structure(s) exceeds 0.5 in which case the total new redevelopment FAR shall
not exceed the existing FAR. For example, a 20,000 square foot site containing an existing building with a floor
area of 7,000 square feet would have a FAR (7,000/20,000) of 0.35. In this scenario, redevelopment would allow
for an increase to a total of 10,000 square feet for a FAR (10,000/20,000) of 0.5. A 20,000 square foot site
containing an existing building with a floor area of 12,000 square feet would have a FAR (12,000/20,000) of 0.6.
Under this scenario, redevelopment could not allow for an increase in floor area above the existing FAR.
The total lot area calculation shall not include the area of any of the following natural features: Inland wetlands
and/or watercourses, slopes with an incline of 25% or greater or 100 year flood hazard area (Zone A/AE). This is
the buildable area calculation.
The Development Intensity Calculation shall be further limited by the ability of the site to provide adequate offstreet
parking that shall be not less than 1.5 parking spaces per residential unit and parking spaces meeting the
requirements of Section 9 of the Building-Zone Regulations for all non-residential uses. Provided however the
zoning authority may reduce the number of non-residential parking spaces required by waiver upon a finding of
appropriateness.
Notwithstanding the above specified Development Intensity Calculation, the maximum number of dwellings
allowed on that portion of an ARZ property in excess of 5 buildable acres shall not exceed the number allowed by an
FAR of 0.25 or 15 dwelling units/acre, whichever is less.
76
4.17.2 (d) Building Height
Buildings shall not exceed a height of forty feet (40) as measured in accordance with the Building-Zone
Regulations and shall not exceed three stories of living space, except that any existing building that exceeds that
height may remain and utilize existing stories, even if greater than the new construction limitation of three stories.
4.17.2 (e) Open Space
Open space set aside or established as part of the Site Development Plan shall be made available for public use if
deemed to be a public benefit and if required by the Town Council as part of the Site Development Plan. If not so
dedicated, adequate provisions shall be made for the maintenance and upkeep of such open space, including any
recreational facilities provided therein, by an organization established by the developer with the power to obtain
assessments through enforceable covenants against privately owned land within the development. Nothing set forth
above shall be construed either as a requirement or obligation on the part of the Town of Glastonbury to make any
repairs or improvements to any property subject to these covenants and restrictions or to enforce any covenant or
restriction contained herein.
4.17.3 Procedure and Application
An application for Change of Zone to ARZ shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 16 of the
Building-Zone Regulations and shall include Site Development Plans containing the following data/information:

general, and also for any open space created in accordance with Section 4.17.2 (f) above.
c. Utilities, drainage and other infrastructure have been designed in a manner that ensures satisfactory operation
for the life of the project, and components that have a shorter useful life have been designed in accordance with
sound engineering practice, state and local requirements and guidance documents to ensure satisfactory
operation.
d. The streets and drives will be suitable to carry anticipated traffic and increased densities will not generate traffic
in such amounts as to overload the street network in the area.

The Zoning Authority may establish phasing time limits with such time limits controlling the completion of the
development or phases within. Each phase shall contain an approximately proportional amount of new construction
and preservation of the historic buildings on site. Such time limits may be revised by resolution of the Zoning
Authority following a review and a finding that said revision will provide for the successful completion of the
project.
4.17.6 Approved Site Development Plan Changes
Minor changes to an approved Site Development Plan may, with the written approval of the Town Manager, be
made, provided such changes shall not substantially affect the overall architectural and site design of the Adaptive
Redevelopment Zone. Such changes shall in no way affect overall density, impact or nature of the development.
Such minor changes may include but are not limited to, the locations of catch basins, manholes and other technical
aspects of drainage, slight alteration of the location of roads, sidewalks, structures or buildings due to unforeseen
topographic or geologic features, slight alteration of finished contours, minor re-arrangement of lighting standards,
benches and other incidental street furniture. If the Town Manager shall have any questions to whether such a
proposed change is minor or not, such change shall require the review and written approval of the Town Council,
after receiving a report of its recommendation from the Town Plan and Zoning Commission.
4.17.7 Financial Guarantee
Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the developer shall submit acceptable financial guarantees to ensure the
installation of any incomplete public improvements. The financial guarantee shall be in an amount approved by the
Town Engineer and in a form authorized by Connecticut General Statutes and approved by the Town Plan and
Zoning Commission. Upon completion of public improvements, the financial guarantee shall be released by the

use or second level use category, if any, which is so like the use in question in purpose, function, character, and
effect as to be substantially similar to said listed use.
If the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that the use in question is substantially similar to a use or second level
use category specifically listed in the Table, such use shall be permitted in the zones in the same manner as the
substantially similar listed use or second level use category and subject to the same conditions and requirements
controlling said substantially similar listed use or second level use category.
If the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that the use in question is not substantially similar to a use or second
level use category specifically listed in the Table, such use may be permitted and added to the Table only by
amending these Regulations as provided for in Section 16.
In determining the status of the use in question, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall also consider all other codes,
ordinances, laws and statutes.

business uses located on the property as follows: up to 3 businesses shall convert to 24 sq. Ft. and 4 or
more businesses shall convert to 32 sq. ft. The property owner shall be responsible for the submission
of plans the equitably distribute the available space on any ground sign.

design review approval in accordance with the provisions of this section.
12.3 Permitted Stipulations With Special Permit With Design Review Approval
The Commission, in approving a special permit with design review approval after applying these Regulations in
harmony with their general intent, may stipulate such restrictions as appear to the Commission to be reasonable to
protect or promote the rights of individuals, property values and the environment in the area as a whole, the public
health, safety or welfare, sound planning and zoning principles, improved land use, site planning and land
development, or better overall neighborhood compatibility. Such restrictions may concern, without limitation, the
components of the site plan and layout, distribution of and relationship between uses and structures, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, parking, open space, landscaping, screening, signs, lighting and building design, architectural
treatment and massing.
12.4 Criteria For Evaluating A Special Permit With Design Review Approval
The Commission shall consider and evaluate each and every application for a special permit with design review
approval by applying, at a minimum, the following criteria:
a. Appropriateness of Location or Use:
1. The size and intensity of the proposed use or uses and its or their effect on and compatibility with
the adopted Town Plan of Development, the specific zone and the neighborhood;
2. The existence of other uses of the same kind or character in the neighborhood and the effect
thereof on said neighborhood, and conformity to any adopted neighborhood plan;
3. The capacity of adjacent and feeder street to handle peak traffic loads and hazards created by the
use;
4. The obstruction of light or air, or the emission of noise, light, smoke, odor, gas, dust or vibration
in noxious or offensive quantities, and the distance between offensive processes and adjacent
properties;
5. The overall effect on values and utilization of neighborhood properties;
6. Unusual topography of the location, the nature, location, and height of buildings, walls, stacks,
fences, grades and landscaping of the site;
7. The extent, nature and arrangement of parking facilities, entrances and exits;
156
8. Problems of fire and police protection;
9. The preservation of the character of the neighborhood;
10. The availability of adequate sewerage and water supply;

neighboring areas for residential, business or other purposes, and, by doing so, impairs the benefits of
occupancy of existing property in such areas, the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real
property in the area, prevents the most appropriate development and use of such areas, produces
degeneration of property with attendant deterioration of conditions in the area affecting the health, general
safety and welfare of the community, and destroys a proper relationship between the taxable values of real
property in the area and the cost of municipal services provided therefore.

20.9 Establishment Of Groundwater Protection Zones And Boundaries
For the purposes of this Section 20, two overlay zones, as depicted on the map referred to in Section 20.9.1 of these
Regulations, are established:
a. Groundwater Protection Zone 1 (GW-1) generally consists of all land underlain by coarse-grained Stratified
Drift at the land surface. This zone has the most restrictive regulations and requirements due to the
potential contamination of Groundwater. Groundwater availability is characterized by potentially yielding
substantial quantities of water.
b. Groundwater Protection Zone 2 (GW-2) consists of all land classified as being Glacial Till that is generally
mapped as having less than ten (10) feet thickness over bedrock. Restrictions in this zone are directed at
protecting and preserving the bedrock Aquifer so it may provide the best possible quality and quantity of
water in individual wells because this is the principle recharge area to the bedrock Aquifer.
20.9.1 Map
Boundaries of the Groundwater Protection Zones within the town are shown on the map entitled "Groundwater
Protection Zones Map. Glastonbury, Connecticut Scale of 1 inch equals 1,500 feet, Approved October 10, 1995,
Effective January 1, 1996" which is on file with the Glastonbury Town Clerk and the Office of Community
Development. The map may be periodically updated based on new technical information as approved and adopted
by the Commission after a Public Hearing.
187
20.9.2 Resolution of Boundary Disputes
There the boundaries of the Groundwater Protection Zone(s) are in dispute, the landowner must demonstrate that the
boundaries shown on the map are incorrect based on evidence provided by a qualified hydro geologist. When doubt
exists with respect to the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence of the hydro geologist, the Commission may
commission a further study by an independent hydro geologist selected by the Commission to resolve the dispute.

DECLARATION OF EASEMENT
FOR DRIVEWAY AND UTILITIES
Declaration (this Declaration made this day of by (hereinafter referred to as
Declarant).
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, Declarant is the owner of certain premises (the Easement Are shown on a map or plan
entitled which map is on file as -------------------------- or to be filed with the Town Clerk of the Town of
Glastonbury to which references may be had and which Easement Area compromises parts of Lots as shown to,
Lots shall be referred to by their lot number and when referred to collectively all said lots shall hereinafter be
referred to as the Burdened Lots) ; and
WHEREAS, Declarant does not desire to have Lots --------------- as shown on the aforementioned map (the
Easement Properties) serviced by separate driveways, but rather to establish a mutual easement arrangement
which will service the Easement Properties and which will provide ingress and egress to and from [street] and
provide a location for the installation of utilities to service the Easement Properties or any of
WHEREAS, Declarant desires to establish this Declaration of Easement to create an easement on, over, under and
through the Easement Area for the benefit of the Easement Properties; and
WHEREAS, Declarant further desires to impose certain covenants and restrictions upon the use, operation
and maintenance of the Easement Area;
WHEREAS , the Burdened Lots are specifically made part of this Agreement, and the owners of the
Burdened Lots shall receive the benefits and be subject to the burdens contained herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, Declarant hereby submits the Easement Area to the terms, covenants, restrictions
and easements set forth herein for the benefit of the Easement Properties as follows:
I. GRANT OF EASEMENT
Declarant hereby grants and declares, to the extent described herein, for the benefit of the Easement
Properties, as easement and right of way over and upon the Easement Area, which easement shall be appurtenant to
and for the benefit of the Easement Properties and may be used by the owners of the Easement Properties, their
heirs, successors, assigns, licensees and guests.
II. USE OF EASEMENT AREA
The Easement Area shall be used for the purpose of ingress and egress to and from [street] by vehicular and
pedestrian traffic and for the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of utility lines (including lines for
storm water discharge, electric, cable, telephone, sewer, water and other residential utilities) together with any
appurtenances related thereto (hereinafter referred to as Utilities) in order to furnish utility services to the
Easement Properties.
The owners of the Easement Properties (hereinafter collectively referred to as Owners and individually
referred to as Owners) shall have the right in common with other Owners to enter on, over, under and through the
Easement Area for the purpose of construction, installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of driveway and
of Utilities, provided however, that any Owner/Owners who shall do any work or have any work done affecting the
198
Easement Area upon completion of the work shall repair that portion of the Easement Area to the condition that
existed prior to such Owners entry (except a\for any work done pursuant to the rights created herein) and shall at all
times keep so much of the Easement Area open so that vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall have access from
[street] to Easement Properties.
III. ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY
When utilizing the Easement Area the Owners shall do so as expeditiously as possible and in such manner
as will cause the least possible disturbance to the other Owners.
IV. OWNERS OF BURDENED LOTS MAY CONTINUE TO USE EASEMENT AREA BUT MAY
NOT INTERFERE
The owners of the Burdened Lots may continue to use the Easement Area in any way that will not prevent
the use of the Easement Area by any owner for the purposes described herein. The owners of the Burdened Lots
shall not erect or allow any structures to be erected on the Easement Area, nor shall they plant or allow to be planted
or grown any large trees or any other obstructions which would prevent the use of the Easement Area by the owners.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall diminish the rights and obligations of the owners of the Burdened Lots,
which are established in this Declaration.
V. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF EASEMENT AREA
The Owner shall maintain the Easement Area in its present condition or in the condition to which it is
improved from time to time, free and clear of obstruction, shall repair the same as necessary, shall keep the same
reasonably free and clear of ice and snow removal, clearing of the driveway, and insurance thereon shall be
responsible for a proportional share of such cost computed by dividing one by the number of lots served by the
driveway over the Easement Area (a Required Share). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no owner shall be
responsible for any expenses hereunder until a Building Permit has been issued shall be included in the number of
lots served by the driveway over the Easement Area.
The cost of maintenance, repair and replacement of Utilities within the Easement Area shall not be borne
by the specific Owner/Owners whose individual lot/lots is/are benefited by such Utilities and if more than one owner
is benefited by such Utilities and if more than one Owner is benefited, then such cost shall be borne on an equal
basis. Once Utilities are installed in the Easement Area, then any of the Owners shall have the right to tie in to
Utilities, provided that they shall do so in a good and proper manner without damage to the Utilities. (The Owner
desiring said installation shall pay the cost of the original installation of Utilities.) The obligations created in this
paragraph deal with maintenance, repair and replacement.
The construction material utilized in the driveway shall not be changed unless a majority of the Owners
agree to install a different surface, provided no such change shall be permitted that would violate any land use
permit issued by the Town of Glastonbury and any such change shall conform to the requirements of any
governmental authority.
The rest of this paragraph notwithstanding, any Owner who shall, through negligence or willful action,
cause any damage which must be repaired hereunder, shall be responsible for the cost incurred to provide the
repairs, maintenance and replacement necessitated by the negligence or willful action of that Owner, provided,
however, that the Declarant and all subsequent owners mutually waive their respective rights of recovery against
each other for any loss insured by fire, extended coverage and other property insurance policies existing for the
benefit of the respective parties.
The cost for repairing, replacing, maintaining or improving the Easement Area, pursuant to this Agreement,
shall be shared as set forth above. Except as herein provided, no costs of any kind shall be charged to any Owner,
unless that Owner has agreed in writing to pay said costs. In the event that the Owner of any lot shall decide that
expenditures shall be incurred for repair and replacing, maintaining or improving the Easement Area, then said
Owner shall send written notice to the other Owners, which shall request that the other Owner agree to pay their
199
Required Share of the cost of such repair, replacement, maintenance or improvement. In the event that the other
Owners agree to pay their Required share, then the Owner proposing said activity and any Owners who agree to pay
their Required Shares in writing, then the costs shall be shared accordingly. In the event that one or more of the
other Owners do not agree in writing to pay their Required Share, then the Owner proposing said activity and any
Owners who agree to pay their Required Share may undertake said activity solely at their own cost and expense. In
that event, after the work is completed, the Owner/Owners performing the work may institute legal action against
the other Owners who did not contribute to the cost of such activity. In the event that a court should issue a final,
non-appeal ruling that the work was necessary to maintain the Easement Area to the standard required hereunder,
and if the work was done to the quality required, then the Owners who should have shared said costs shall be
entitled to be reimbursed by the other Owners not only for their Required Share, but also for the expenses incurred
in said collection including a reasonable attorneys fee, if a court action is instituted. All repairs, replacement,
maintenance or improvements made to the Easement Area shall be made to quality suitable to accomplish the
purposes for which the easement Area has been created.
VI. PERMANENT EASEMENT
The easement created herein shall be a permanent easement, and shall bind the Declarant, all subsequent
Owners, their heirs, successors and assigns.
VII. INTEREST DUE WITH REGARD TO UNPAID OBLIGATIONS
In the event of a failure by an Owner to pay his Required Share of any costs or expenses incurred
hereunder, such costs and expenses shall, commencing thirty (30) days after the date of billing therefore, bear
interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum until paid.
VIII. GRANT AND RESERVATION
Declarant hereby reserves the right to grant rights of access over the Easement Area to any utility company
required by the Department of Public Utility Control of the State of Connecticut or to the Town of Glastonbury for
the purposes herein contained. The Owners will sign any documents required by the aforementioned utility
companies or the Town of Glastonbury to carry out the intent of this paragraph, which is to provide utility service to
the Easement Properties.
IX. COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS
The covenant, agreement and restrictions set forth herein shall be effective as of the date hereof and shall
continue in full force and effect until written agreement of all of the Owners of the lots compromising the Easement
Properties and all the parties holding mortgages secured by any lots compromising the Easement Properties shall
modify this Declaration of Easement, which modification shall be effective when recorded in the Glastonbury Land
Records and upon approval of the Glastonbury Town Plaza and Zoning Commission as an amendment to any
Special Permit issued pursuant to Section 6.8 of the Glastonbury Building Zone Regulations for any or all of the
Easement Properties. The covenants, agreement and restrictions herein may not be terminated nor may any limit be
imposed on the annual expenses to be paid by any owner.
X. SUBSEQUENT MODIFICATIONS
All modifications to this agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Owners of all properties benefited
or burdened by the easement rights created herein. However, in the event that the Declarant shall request that minor
modifications be made to this agreement, or shall not substantially interfere with any of the rights or obligations
created hereunder, then the Owners of said properties will sign a modification prepared by Declarant in order to
accomplish said minor modifications.
200
XI. MISCELLANEOUS
A. The covenants, agreements and restrictions contained herein shall be covenants running with and
for the benefit of and burden upon the Easement Properties and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Owners therefore, and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. The rights granted herein shall be considered
to create permanent easements.
B In the event that the Owners desire to jointly make any decisions hereunder, they shall be made by
majority vote of the Owners of the lots comprising the Easement Properties.
C Each of the lots compromising the Easement Properties shall be treated as if it has one Owner. If
any of said lots owned by more than one person, then all of said persons must unanimously agree on any decision to
which they are entitled to vote hereunder. Therefore, if all of said persons cannot unanimously agree, then the
Owner of said lots shall have no vote.
D All communications sent pursuant to this Declaration shall be sent in writing and sent by certified
mail to the last known address of the recipient.
XII. MERGER
The easement rights create herein shall not merge with the fee ownership interest of any lot.
XIII. RESTORATION
At any time that any Owner shall exercise any rights hereunder, then, when said activity is completed, the
Easement Area shall be restored to the condition it was in immediately prior to said activity, except to the extent
permitted hereunder.

on item unit costs established by the Town. Any Conditional Approval shall
lapse five (5) years from the date it is granted, provided the Applicant may
apply for and the Commission may grant a renewal of such Conditional
Approval for an additional period of five (5) years, except that the Commission
may provide for a shorter period of Conditional Approval renewal. Any
person, firm, or corporation who prior to Final Subdivision Approval sells any
lot subdivided pursuant to Conditional Approval, shall be fined not more than
$500 for each lot sold or offered for sale.

the Commission, upon notice and Public Hearing, if it finds that any
requirements of the Subdivision Regulations or any lawful order of the
Commission are violated, or if it finds that the approval of the Subdivision
Plan was granted in reliance on any material misstatements. Notice of such
revocation shall be placed in the land records and shall be indexed in the name
of the record owners.

the responsibility of the Applicant to assure that his contractor is familiar with
the plans, specifications, conditions of approval, and any other requirements or
restrictions associated with the project. There shall be no work performed
within the subdivision, with the exception of that allowed under Section 3.2 of
these regulations, prior to the preconstruction meeting. The Department of
Public Works and Office of Community Development shall determine if the
project is ready for construction and give notice at the meeting.

6.0 Open Space Land Dedication and Open Space Subdivisions
6.1 Open Space Land Dedication The Commission may require the provision of
open space, parks and playgrounds as part of a subdivision. Such open space,
parks and playgrounds shall be shown on the Subdivision Plan.
6.2 Purpose Open space shall be established to promote orderly community
development and to benefit the
present and future residents of the Town in order to accomplish objectives such
as:
(a) to preserve and provide recreation areas, farm land, tree cover,
greenbelts, wildlife habitat and corridors, unusual terrain, land forms or
other natural features, and scenic and historic resources; to supplement
existing open space and recreational areas.
(b) to promote the development of land in a way that is sensitive to the
environment;
(c) to promote development that is compatible with surrounding residential
areas;
(d) to preserve and protect inland wetlands, watercourses, and aquifers and
to avoid the potential for flooding, erosion, and water pollution;
(e) to control the extent to which steep slopes and problem soils are
utilized for roadways, sewage disposal systems and other aspects of
development;
(f) to preserve the town's rural character by providing and preserving
compatible streetscapes and other visual amenities along roadways.
6.3 Public Open Space The Commission may accept open space dedicated
perpetually to the Town, or Open Space protected by a Conservation Easement,
provided that it determines the public interest would be served by such
dedication. In making such determination it shall consider, among other
things, the objectives of the Plan of Development, access to and use of the
open space by the general public, and restrictions and purposes of the open
space.
6.4 Open Space Preservation Mechanisms Permanent preservation of each such
area of open space shall be accomplished by one or more of the following
mechanisms, as deemed proper by the Commission: (1) conveyance of a fee
interest to the Town or State; (2) conveyance of a conservation easement with
full, limited, or prohibited public access; (3) conveyance of a fee interest to a
Connecticut non-stock corporation of which all owners of land within the
subdivision are members; (4) conveyance of a fee interest therein, to a tax
exempt organization approved by the Commission, or a conservation easement
in favor thereof; (5) provision of private open space, such as common land held
by an association of homeowners; (6) any other method proposed by the
applicant which accomplishes permanent preservation of such open space land.
6.5 Common Open Space If the Commission determines that the dedication of
open space to the Town would not be in the public interest, it may require the
open space to be transferred to an association of lot owners. The owner of each
lot in the subdivision shall own an undivided interest in the open space
proportionate to the total number of lots in the subdivision. Such transfer shall
be in accordance with the standards established by the Commission to include,
but not be limited to, the following:
Creation of the lot owners association before any lots are sold;
(A) Mandatory membership by the original lot owner and transferred to any
subsequent buyer(s);
(B) Powers to assess and collect from each lot owner a fair share of
association costs, and all costs of ownership of the open space,
including maintenance, improvements, insurance, taxes and the like;
(C) Such restrictions on the use and development of this open space as may
be required by the Commission;
(D) Responsibility for providing adequate maintenance;
(E) Approval of certificate of incorporation, by-laws, restrictions,
easements, deeds and other documents to implement the provisions of
this section by the Town Attorney.
(F) Provision that if the Commission determines that the maintenance or
preservation of the open space no longer complies with the terms of the
document referenced in subsection (F) above, the Town may take all
necessary action, including but not limited to appropriate legal action,
to assure compliance and assess against the association all costs thereby
incurred by the Town.
6.6 Other Lands of Applicant In determining the total open space to be
dedicated, the Commission may, if the Applicant so requests, consider not only
the tract or tracts to be subdivided immediately but also any other adjacent tract
owned, controlled or under agreement to buy or optioned by the Applicant or
corporation controlled or owned by the Applicant.
6.7 Referrals The Commission may refer for comment and review the subdivision
plan and proposal for provision of open space to any appropriate local agency
or organization which the Commission deems may have an interest in said plan
and proposal.
6.8 Condition of Open Space Any land to be dedicated as open space shall be
left in its existing state, except for improvements as may be required by the
Commission, and shall not be graded, cleared, or used as a repository for brush,
stumps, earth, building materials, debris, or any other materials.
6.9 Exception The open space preservation requirements of these regulations
shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5)
parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle
or first cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision is to contain
affordable housing, as defined in CGS Section 8-39a, equal to twenty per cent
or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. If the
Commission determines, based on events subsequent to the approval of such
subdivision, that such transfers were temporary, and for the purpose of evading
the requirements of these regulations, the Commission may void the
subdivision approval in accordance with Section 5.15 of these regulations.
6.10 Open Space Subdivision Upon request by an Applicant, the Commission may
permit the development of any proposed subdivision as an Open Space
Subdivision in accordance with Section 6.7 of the Building-Zone Regulations
and Section 8-25 of the CGS, excluding the provision for fees in lieu of open
space.

approval, the Applicant shall submit a mylar to the Director of Public Works.
9.0 Warrantee Deeds
9.1 Property Covered The Applicant shall provide a Warrantee Deed running
from the record owner to the Town, free and clear of all encumbrances which
would in any way affect public use, for all streets, open space, and other public
lands as may be required, together with all required utility, access, and other
easements as shown on the final subdivision plan approved by the
Commission. When applicable, Certificate(s) of Title and/or Subordination
Agreements may be required. All documents must be reviewed and approved
by the Director of Public Works prior to filing subdivision plans.
9.2 Escrow The Warrantee Deed must be acceptable to the Town Attorney and
shall refer to maps by title and to road stationing where necessary for Town
acceptance of public streets. Such deed shall be held in escrow by the
Commission to be recorded on the Town land records upon acceptance by the
Town of such streets as Town roads, and in no case shall the acceptance of any
such deed by any board or commission, official agent, or employee of the
Town be deemed an acceptance of such streets by the Town.
10.0 Street and Highway Standards
10.1 General The following criteria shall apply to the planning, layout, and
construction of proposed streets in any subdivision.
10.2 Streets Streets shall be laid out in order to provide a safe and efficient network
that will accommodate present and future needs of the area in accordance with
the Plan of Development of the Town. Street design and layout shall follow
the general contours of the land, with a location and grade that preserves to the
greatest possible extent the natural terrain, trees, and other significant natural,
man-made and scenic features.
10.3 Classification of Streets and Highways The Commission shall classify or
reclassify all the streets within or abutting the subdivision. There shall be five
(5) classifications of streets:
(a) Arterial Street One which provides for through traffic movement
between areas and across the town, direct access to abutting property, and
where the projected average daily traffic 20 years after the completion of
construction is over 3,000 vehicles.
(b) Collector Street One which provides for traffic movement between
arterials and local streets, direct access to abutting property, and where the
projected average daily traffic 20 years after completion of construction is
between >1,500 and 3,000 vehicles.
(c) Local Street One which provides for direct access to abutting land, where
the projected average daily traffic 20 years after completion of construction is
between >500 and 1,500 vehicles.
(d) Light Local Street One which provides for direct access to abutting land,
where the projected average daily traffic 20 years after completion of
construction is between >200 and 500 vehicles.
(e) Limited Local Street One which provides for direct access to abutting
land, where the projected average daily traffic 20 years after completion of
construction is under 200 vehicles. Such classification shall be based upon the
finding that there is no adjoining property which would be served by the
extension of the road or a connection to an existing street in such a way as
would exceed 200 vehicle trips per day.
10.4 Minimum Roadway Design Specifications: The following minimum
specifications shall be satisfied according to the classification of street:
CLASSIFICATIONS ARTERIAL COLLECTOR LOCAL LIGHT LIMITED
OF STREETS LOCAL LOCAL
AVERAGE DAILY
TRAFFIC >3000 1500-3000 500-1500 200-500 0-200
DESIGN SPEED 40 MPH 35 MPH 30 MPH 30 MPH 20 MPH
SIGHT LINE 275' 225' 200' 200' 125'
PAVEMENT WIDTH 32' 30' 26' 24' 22'
SNOWSHELF WIDTH
WITH SIDEWALKS 10' 10' 10' 10' 10'
WITHOUT SIDEWALKS 10' 10' 6' 6' 6'
RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTH 60' 50' 50' 50' 40'
The Commission shall determine snow shelf width including the amount of vegetative
clearing, grading and regrading within the Town right-of-way.
10.5 Cul-de-sac Street
(a) Where permanent cul-de-sac streets are included in a residential subdivision, they shall not
exceed fifteen hundred (1500) feet in length. A permanent cul-de-sac shall contain a
turnaround which has a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty-five (55) feet and a minimum
outside pavement radius of forty-five (45) feet except where a permanent cul-de-sac has
classification "Light Local" or "Limited Local" the Commission may permit a turnaround
which has a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty (50) feet and a minimum outside pavement
radius of forty-five (45) feet. A twenty-five (25) foot pavement width shall be provided
around cul-de-sac islands located on "Light Local" or "Limited Local" streets. Low
maintenance cul-de-sac islands may be permitted.
(b) When a cul-de-sac is proposed as a permanent measure, it shall be determined that there is an
inability for future access at or near this location from adjoining properties. The design for
permanent cul-de-sacs may be circular of offset circular.
(c) When a cul-de-sac is proposed as a temporary measure pending future development of
adjoining properties, it shall be so designed as to allow feasible continuation in the adjacent
tract. When there is a possibility of an extension of a street, all portions of the cul-de-sac,
including pavement, grass strip and sidewalk that fall outside the limits of the normal
right-of-way width shall occupy the space by virtue of an easement delivered to the Town
before acceptance of the subdivision. The design for temporary cul-de-sacs may be circular,
offset circular, "T" shaped, or "Y" shaped. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be constructed with
wearing pavement surface.
(d) The Applicant extending a street from a cul-de-sac shall be required to remove the existing
pavement outside of the standard traveled way, loam and seed said area in which pavement
has been removed, and install curbs and sidewalks in the original cul-de-sac in accordance
with Town requirements all at the Applicant's expense.
(e) The Commission may require or permit variation from the 1500' maximum cul-de-sac street
length upon a three-quarters vote of all Commission members. An Applicant requesting a
waiver shall submit its request in writing stating in full the grounds and facts relied upon. In
determining the appropriateness of such variation, the Commission shall consider the
following:
(1) Future roadway access to adjoining undeveloped parcels.
(2) Vehicular capacity of the subject roadway and adjoining roadways.
(3) Present and projected traffic conditions, including volume, speed and sight lines.
(4) Minimization of environmental disturbance, including grading, blasting,
disturbance of vegetation, wetlands and watercourses or other natural or man-made
features.
(5) The adopted Plan of Development.
(6) Any other safety matters.
Variation to cul-de-sac street length may not be granted if it would have a significant
adverse effect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. The Commission shall
state upon its record(s) the reasons for which a waiver is granted.
10.6 Developments Abutting or With Access on Existing Streets When proposed subdivisions abut
or have access to existing Town streets, the following requirements shall be adhered to:
(a) Right of-Way A street line shall be established to provide for future widening of the existing
street. The street line shall be set in accordance with the requirements as to width and
alignment for the classification assigned to the street by the Commission. The Applicant shall
provide the Town with a Warrantee Deed for any additional land between the newly established
street line and the edge of the existing street line.
(b) Reconstruction or Widening Upon the determination by the Commission that improvements
are needed to maintain safe traffic operations, any portion of the existing street frontage from its
centerline to the street line shall be reconstructed in conformance with the requirements of the
classification assigned to the street by the Commission with consideration for preserving
significant natural, man-made and scenic resources. Additionally, any slope rights necessary to
accommodate future modifications shall be provided by the Applicant.
The Commission may vary the minimum roadway design specifications as established by Section
10.4 for the reconstruction of an existing street fronting a subdivision upon a three-quarters vote of
all Commission members. In determining the appropriateness of such variation, the Commission
shall consider:
(1) the extent of the environmental disturbance that roadway reconstruction will cause
and its potential adverse impact on existing resources including:
[a] removal of stone walls, trees, ledge outcroppings or other natural, or man-made
features, or
[b] grading which requires cut and/or fill, including blasting, within or near areas
of steep slopes, wetlands, ponds, watercourses or stands of trees;
(2) present and projected dwelling unit density and vehicular traffic within the area;
(3) present and projected road conditions, including seasonal hazards; and
(4) present and projected traffic conditions, including volume, speed and sight lines.
Variation to roadway standards may not be granted if it would have a significant adverse effect on
adjacent property or on public health and safety. The Commission shall state upon its record(s) the
reasons for which a waiver is granted.
10.7 Preserving the Integrity of the Area In the planning, design, and construction of streets and
associated development, existing natural, man-made and scenic resources should be preserved to
the greatest possible extent and any disturbance thereof, including the felling of any trees, held to
that which is necessary for construction and public safety. The Applicant should demonstrate a
diligent effort in the preservation and protection of such resources. The following are guidelines
in furtherance of this objective:
(a) Through Traffic Minimization: All streets with local classifications shall be laid out so that
their use for through traffic will be discouraged. Particular attention should be given to
eliminating possible by-passes around congested areas and major intersections.
(b) Relation to Topography: The streets of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical relationship
to the topography, following to the greatest possible extent the existing contours of the land.
Deviations therefrom shall be held to an absolute minimum. All streets shall be arranged so as to
obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of the streets.
(c) Preservation of Existing Resources: All existing natural, man-made, or scenic resources shall
be preserved and protected to the greatest possible extent. Such resources include, but are not
limited to: stone walls, steep slopes with a gradient greater than 20%, ledge outcroppings,
specimen trees and stands of trees, including rare and unusual flora and fauna, endangered species,
species of special concern, watercourses, ponds, wetlands, scenic vistas, ridge lines, and any other
significant geological features such as eskers, kames, or kettles.
10.8 Street Names Streets shall bear names which do not duplicate or approximate, in spelling or
sound, existing street names in Glastonbury. It is the objective to utilize names with geographical
or historical significance in the Town of Glastonbury. All street names shall be approved by the
Commission.
10.9 Monuments Official Glastonbury highway monuments shall be placed at all angle points, and the
points of curves in streets and at such intermediate points as may be necessary. The location of all
monuments shall be indicated on the final subdivision plan to the satisfaction of the Commission.
Monuments must be installed and their accuracy certified by a Registered Land Surveyor. The
type of monuments at each designated location shall be as directed by the Director of Public
Works, and set flush with proposed grades. Additionally, all lot corners in a subdivision shall be
marked with iron pin or pipe or other permanent markers before a certificate of occupancy can be
issued.

11.2 Variation from Sidewalk Standards The Commission may require or permit variation from the
established sidewalk requirements upon a three-quarters vote of all Commission members. An
Applicant requesting a waiver shall submit its request in writing stating in full the grounds and
facts relied upon.
In determining the appropriateness of such variation, the Commission shall consider:
(a) the extent of the environmental disturbance that sidewalk construction will cause and its
potential adverse impact on existing resources including:
(1) removal of stone walls, trees, ledge outcroppings or other natural, or man-made
features; or
(2) grading which requires cut and/or fill, including blasting, within or near areas of
steep slopes, wetlands, ponds, watercourses or stands of trees;
(b) proximity to existing sidewalks and present and projected sites for schools, village centers
and public facilities and pedestrian traffic;
(c) present and projected dwelling unit density and pedestrian traffic within the areas;
(d) present and projected road conditions, including seasonal hazards; and
(e) present and projected traffic conditions, including volume, speed and sight lines.
Variation to sidewalk standards may not be granted if it would have a significant adverse effect
on adjacent property or on public health and safety. The Commission shall state upon its
record(s) the reasons for which a waiver is granted.
11.3 Sidewalk Location Sidewalks shall be located either within the public rights of way or in
public sidewalk easements and shall be designated with due attention to pedestrian safety,
sufficient snow shelf, and preservation of street trees.
12.0 Storm Drainage for Streets and Individual Lots
12.1 General Drainage Requirements Storm drainage systems designed and constructed as part
of a subdivision shall serve to protect the life and property of area residents, the traveling
public, the Town and the State. Specific drainage design shall be in accordance with the
Town of Glastonbury Storm Drainage Management Report, as amended from time to time.

rivers, or into Town drains with adequate capacity to carry the additional water. All points of
discharge shall be approved by the Town. Where the discharge shall be into private property
adjoining the proposed subdivision, proper easements and discharge rights shall be secured by
the Applicant in favor of the Town before approval of the final map and acceptance of the
drainage plan. No storm drain system shall drain into a natural watercourse, whether
continually flowing or intermittent, so as to exceed the existing capacity of the watercourse.
12.3 Curtain and Footing Drainage Discharge of footing, foundation or curtain drains, in
association with lot development, shall be directed into a street storm drainage system, a dry
well or a wetlands or watercourse or in a manner otherwise acceptable to the Commission.

13.2 Waiver of Underground Installation The Commission may, by a three-quarters vote of all
Commission members, waive the requirement of underground installation of such utilities in
those portions of subdivisions abutting an existing Town street which does not have such
installation or if it finds that safe underground installation is not feasible because of soil,
ledge, or water conditions or other natural or man-made conditions.
Variation to underground installation of utilities may not be granted if it would have a
significant adverse effect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. The
Commission shall state upon its record(s) the reasons for which a waiver is granted.
13.3 Public Water System In subdivisions where water can be furnished from a public source, all
necessary mains, branch offsets to each lot, and fire hydrants shall be installed by the
Applicant as approved by the public utility or municipal agency having jurisdiction, without
expense to the Town, and to the satisfaction of the Town.
13.4 Community Water System If a public water supply is not available to a subdivision, the
Applicant may install a community water system subject to the approval of appropriate state
and local agencies. Such system shall meet the specifications for and be capable of
connection to a public water system if such system should become available at a later date.
13.5 Individual Well Where no public water system is available or community water system
proposed, lots shall be served by individual wells in accordance with the provisions of local
ordinances, CGS and/or the State of Connecticut Public Health Code.
13.6 Sanitary Sewers Where a connection to the public sanitary sewer system is available to a
subdivision, the Applicant shall install a sanitary sewer system in accordance with the

expense of the Applicant.
13.7 Capped Sewers Capped sanitary sewers shall be installed or designed by an Applicant in
accordance with the provisions of an Ordinance of the Town of Glastonbury providing for
installation of sewers in subdivisions under certain conditions where the subdivision falls
within the scope of said ordinance.
13.8 Private Sewage Disposal System If public sanitary sewers are not available, lots in a
subdivision shall be served by individual or community sewage disposal systems in
accordance the provisions of local ordinances, CGS and/or the State of Connecticut Public
Health Code.
14.0 Landscaping and Preservation of Existing Resources In the planning, design and construction of
any subdivision or resubdivision site, existing natural, man-made and scenic resources should be
preserved to the greatest possible extent and any disturbance thereof, including the felling of any trees,
held to that which is necessary for construction and public safety. The Applicant should demonstrate a
diligent effort in the preservation and protection of such resources which include, but are not limited to,
the following: stone walls, steep slopes and ledge outcroppings, specimen trees and stands of trees,
other vegetation including rare and unusual flora, State declared "protected species", watercourses,
ponds, wetlands, scenic vistas, ridge lines, and any other significant geological features such as eskers,

SECTION 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been
endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an
adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of
flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of
many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have
been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the
deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the
erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated
wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a
significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of Connecticut and has
and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the
ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now
and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from
random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the
public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state.
It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making
provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and
watercourses by
 minimizing their disturbance and pollution;
 maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards
set by federal, state or local authority;
 preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation;
 preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and
vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof;
 deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution;
 protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation,
economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and
 protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought,
overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement;
all by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state
and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever
guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and
enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the
Town of Glastonbury".
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency of the Town of Glastonbury was established in
accordance with an ordinance adopted January 8, 1974 and shall implement the purposes and
provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of
Glastonbury.
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance
with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue, issue with
terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in
the Town of Glastonbury pursuant to Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut
General Statutes, as amended.
1.6 Bases for special goals and objectives or requirements contained within these regulations:
(a) Upland review areas. The concept of upland review areas has its origins in a document
entitled A Guide for Streambelts - Systems of Natural Environmental Corridors in
Connecticut, United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Storrs,
-1-
Connecticut, September 1972. Prior to adoption of these regulations, such upland review
areas were previously regulated under Section 3.25 of the Town of Glastonbury Building
Zone Regulations, effective date of October 22, 1973, as amended through August 1,
1987, but said Section 3.25 was repealed after such areas became regulated under the
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations, Town of Glastonbury Connecticut,
adopted in 1989. Furthermore, this upland review area concept was acknowledged by the
State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection as referenced in their June,
1997 publication Guidelines for Upland Review Area Regulations Under Connecticut
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act which establishes that the relationship between a
wetland or watercourse and its surrounding upland is complex and that certain activities in
upland review areas affect wetlands and watercourses. As established in the definition for
the "upland review area" in Section 2 of these regulations, said upland review area:
extends one-hundred fifty (150) feet beyond the boundary of the wetland or watercourse
within targeted watershed boundaries and subwatersheds of special concern, and along the
main stems of targeted watercourses of special concern that are identified in the Town of
Glastonbury; and extends one-hundred feet beyond the boundary of the wetland or
watercourse within all other areas in the Town of Glastonbury.
(b) The design goal for ten (10) percent or less of effective impervious surface coverage on a
land use proposal (Section 7.7.1.(i)). A review of scientific literature indicates that once a
watershed area's impervious coverage exceeds ten percent, the watercourse, including
water quality, degrades to a point where environmentally engineered mitigation measures
cannot restore the degraded watercourse. Applications for land use proposals which
exceed the ten percent goal and which are located in whole or in part within the targeted
watersheds of special concern identified in Section 2 must involve a determination of
whether the effective impervious surface area will likely result in an adverse impact to the
wetlands or watercourses.

-12-
or affects on downgradient wetlands and/or watercourses from the land use associated
with the regulated activity; the results from such a required water quality testing
program are solely intended for the collection and analysis of data for educational and
scientific purposes.
7. 8 If the proposed activity involves a significant impact, as determined by the Agency, then
additional information (in addition to all other information required within this Section 7),
based on the nature and anticipated effects of the activity, including but not limited to the
following, shall be required:

not interrupting the activity.
7.11 Any application to renew for up to, but not exceeding a 5 year time period, shall be granted
upon request of the Permittee unless the Agency finds that there has been a substantial change
in circumstances which requires a new license or permit application or an enforcement action
has been undertaken with regard to the regulated activity for which the license or permit was
issued, provided the original license or permit shall not exceed a maximum of ten years.
7 .12 If the Agency deems that a peer review of any information submitted by the applicant is
warranted, the applicant will be required to pay the cost of that peer review prior to a
final decision. Pursuant to Section 22a-22a(e) of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Agency
may require a filing fee to be deposited with the Agency in an amount sufficient to cover the

SECTION 10
Considerations for Decision
10.1 The Agency may consider the following in making its decision on an application:
a. the application and its supporting documentation;
b. reports from other agencies and commissions, departments and officials including, but not
limited to the Town of Glastonbury:
(i.) Plan and Zoning Commission;
(ii.) Building Official;
-15-
(iii.) Health Director or registered sanitarian;
(iv.) Town Engineer or Assistant Town Engineer; and
(v.) Director of Community Development, Planner, or Environmental Planner;
c. the Agency may also consider comments on any application from the North Central Soil
and Water Conservation District, the Capitol Region Counsel of Governments Regional
Planning Agency or other regional organizations, agencies in adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by the proposed activity, or other technical agencies or organizations which
may undertake additional studies or investigations;
d. non-receipt of comments from state and regional agencies, other agencies, commissions,
departments, and officials listed in subsection 10.1.b and 10.1.c above within the prescribed
time shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Agency; and
e. for an application for which a public hearing is held, public comments, evidence and
testimony.
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45,
inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating,
licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all
relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the adverse environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses, including the adverse effects on the inland wetlands' and watercourses'
capacity to support desirable biological life, to prevent flooding, to supply and protect
surface and groundwater resources, to control sediment, to facilitate drainage and to
control pollution;
b. the applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed
regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to
wetlands or watercourses;
c. the relationship between the short-term and long-term impacts of the proposed regulated
activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be
caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would
foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation
measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a license or permit for such
activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or
other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3)
in the following order of priority: restore, enhance, and create functional and productive
wetland or watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable
use of property, including abutting or downstream property, which would be caused or
threatened by the proposed regulated activity;
f. impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for
which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to
the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated
activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses.
In applying the above standard and criteria, the Agency shall consider activity in the upland
review area with respect to its adverse impacts on the related wetland and/or watercourse. An
-16-
activity in the upland review area, which is determined pursuant to Section 4.4 of these
regulations, not to adversely affect any wetland or watercourse is not a regulated activity.
10.3 In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the
Agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a
license or permit shall not be issued unless the Agency finds, on the basis of the record. that a
feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the Agency shall
consider the facts and circumstances set forth in subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding
and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record and in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible
and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on
wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose, on the record and in writing, the types of
alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed
to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the license or permit or to
present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) "wetlands and watercourses" includes aquatic, plant or animal
life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) "habitats" means areas or environments
in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 The Agency shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside
wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life
unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or
watercourses.
10. 7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall base its
decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the
hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision. A conclusion that a
feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a presumption that a license or
permit should be issued. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the submitted
application is consistent with the purposes and policies of these regulations and Sections 22a-36
to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes.
10. 8 In the case of a ruling by the Agency that a proposed activity that lies beyond the specified 100
and 150 foot upland review areas is a regulated activity pursuant to subsection 4 of the

Action by Duly Authorized Agent
12.1 The Agency may delegate to its duly authorized agent or designated agent the authority to
approve or extend a license or permit for an activity that is not located in a wetland or
watercourse when such agent finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater
than a minimal impact on any wetlands or watercourses provided such agent has completed the
comprehensive training program developed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection
pursuant to Section 22a-39 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Requests for such approval
shall be made on a form provided by the agent or Agency and shall contain the information
listed under Section 7. 6 of these regulations, unless otherwise directed by the agent, and any

approval, publish, at the applicant's expense, notice of the approval in a newspaper having a
general circulation in the town wherein the activity is located or will have an effect. Any
person may appeal such decision of such agent to the Agency within fifteen days after the
publication date of the notice and the Agency shall consider such appeal at its next regularly
scheduled meeting provided such meeting is no earlier than three business days after receipt by
the Agency or agent of such appeal. Any person may appear and be heard at the meeting held

alter, or reject the decision of its agent or require an application for a license or permit in
accordance with Section 7 of these regulations.
12.3 In the case of administering subsection 12.1 above for a proposed activity within the 150
foot upland review area, but said activity lies over one-hundred (100) feet away from the
closest wetland or watercourse and the duly authorized agent finds that the conduct of such
activity would result in no potential impact on any wetlands and watercourses, then the duly
authorized agent may issue a waiver of the formal approval and publishing requirements
contained within subsections 12.1 and 12.2 above.
SECTION 13
Bond
13.1 The Agency may require, as a condition to the license or permit, the filing of a bond in such

facility or condition which is in violation of the Act or these regulations, the Agency or its
agent may:
a. issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such person conducting
such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to immediately cease such activity or
to correct such facility or condition. Within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of such
order the Agency shall hold a hearing to provide the person an opportunity to be heard and
show cause why the order should not remain in effect. The Agency shall consider the facts
presented at the hearing and within ten (10) days of the completion of the hearing notify the
person by certified mail that the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in
effect, or that the order has been withdrawn. The Agency shall publish notice of its
decision in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality. The original order
shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the Agency affirms, revises
or withdraws the order. The issuance of an order pursuant to this subsection shall not
delay or bar an action pursuant to Section 22a-44(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes, as
amended.

facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation, the jurisdiction of the Agency, and

limitation, halting work in wetlands or watercourses. The Agency may request that the
individual appear at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Agency to discuss the
unauthorized activity, and/ or provide a written reply to the notice or file an application for
the necessary license or permit. Failure to carry out the action(s) directed in a notice of
violation may result in issuance of the order provided in Section 14.4 or other enforcement
proceedings as provided by law.
c. In addition to any other remedy allowed by law, any person who violates any provisions of
the Town of Glastonbury's Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations shall be subject
to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per day; each day extending beyond the
notice of a violation may be deemed by the Agency as a distinct and separate violation.
The amount of the fine shall be based on the severity of the environmental impact of the
unauthorized activity. Issuance of such fines shall be in accordance with procedures
established in town ordinances, including the citation hearing procedure.
14.5 The Agency may suspend or revoke a license or permit if it finds that the Permittee has not
complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the license or permit or has
-20-
exceeded the scope of the work as set forth in the application including application plans. Prior
to revoking or suspending any license or permit, the Agency shall issue notice to the Permittee,
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct which
warrants the intended action. The Agency shall hold a hearing to provide the Permittee an
opportunity to show that the Permittee is in compliance with its issued license or permit and any
and all requirements for retention of the issued license or permit. The Permittee shall be notified
of the Agency's decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain the issued license or permit by
certified mail within fifteen (15) days of the date of its decision. The Agency shall publish notice
of the suspension or revocation in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality.
