PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Lombard, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2013 Code, as supplemented through December 19, 2013, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Village Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2013 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 10 is numbered 10.01, and the first section of chapter 12 is 12.01. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 12.01 and 12.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 12.01.05. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CH1:1 CODE APPENDIX CHA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, and Rachael Calloway, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Nicole Aranas, Assistant Village Manager, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

§ 30.05 - Rules. 
    The following rules are adopted relating to the Board of Trustees: 
(A)  Rule 1. Agenda. Prior to each regular meeting the Village Manager shall cause to be prepared an agenda. The agenda may include a consent agenda. The consent agenda may include agenda items considered routine. All items listed on such a consent agenda will be enacted by one roll call vote with no separate discussion of these items. However, if any Board member requests separate consideration of any consent agenda item, that item shall be removed from the consent agenda for separate action at some other place on the agenda. The format for the agenda shall be as determined by resolution of the Board of Trustees. 
(B)  Rule 2. Voting. In all cases of the passage of an ordinance, the creation of a liability against the village, the expenditure or appropriation of its monies or at the request of any member, the ayes and nays shall be taken; the result shall be recorded in the record book of the Board; and the concurrence of a majority of the members elected of the Board shall be necessary to the passage of any such ordinance, resolution, or appropriation. When a question is stated from the Chair, every member who is present shall vote thereon, unless excused by the President and Board of Trustees, or unless he is personally or directly interested in the question before the Board. At the conclusion of a roll call vote, the Presiding Officer shall announce the results. Once this is done, no vote shall be changed. 
(C)  Rule 3. Expelling a member. Any member acting or appearing in a disgraceful manner, using violent and insulting language to or about any member of the Board of Trustees, or who does not obey the orders of the Chair shall, on motion, be censured by a majority vote of the members present, or expelled by a two-thirds vote of all members elected. 
(D)  Rule 4. Duties of Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall preserve order and decorum, may speak to points or order in preference to other members, and shall decide all questions of order subject to repeal. If he refuses to allow the trustees to exercise their right to appeal a decision of the Chair, the trustees may consider and pass upon the matter in spite of the Chair's failure to grant them an appeal. In all cases not otherwise provided for by law or ordinance, the Board shall be guided by parliamentary law as contained in Robert's Rules of Order and any amendments thereto. 
(E)  Rule 5. Calls to order; appeals from decisions of Chair. A member, when called to order by the Chair, shall thereupon discontinue speaking and take his seat and the order or ruling of the Chair shall be binding and conclusive, subject only to the right of appeal. Any member may appeal to the Board from a ruling of the Chair and, if the appeal is seconded, the member making the appeal may briefly state his reason for the same, and the Chair may briefly explain his ruling; but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other member shall participate in the discussion. The Chair shall then put the question, "Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?" If the majority of the members present vote "No", the decision of the Chair shall be overruled; otherwise, it shall be sustained. 
(F)  Rule 6. Question of personal privilege. The right of a member to address the Board on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which his integrity, character, or motives are assailed, questioned, or impugned. 
(G)  Rule 7. Withdrawal of motion. After a motion or resolution is stated by the Presiding Officer it shall be deemed to be in possession of the Board, but it may be withdrawn at any time before decision by consent of the Board. 
(H)  Rule 8. Division of questions. If any question under consideration contains several distinct propositions, the Board by a majority vote of the members present may divide such questions. 
(I)  Rule 9. Record of motions. In all cases where a resolution or motion is entered in the journal, the name of the members moving and seconding the same shall be entered. 
(J)  Rule 10. Reconsideration. A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for reconsideration, once having been made and decided in the negative, shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be considered. Where a motion to reconsider has passed, relative to the approval or denial of the recommendation of an advisory body required to hold public hearings, and where said recommendation came after the holding of a public hearing, said recommendation shall not be considered for approval or denial except at the same meeting at which the original action to approve or deny was taken or after the matter has been referred to the advisory body for a further hearing and recommendation. 
(K)  Rule 11. Addressing Board of Trustees. Except during the public participation allowed on the regular Board agenda, or as stated in this rule, no person other than the Village Manager or his designee, the Village Clerk, or the Village Attorney may address the Board of Trustees. Any member of the public may address the corporate authorities on a specific agenda item when it is before the Board. The person wishing to speak shall submit a public participation slip or raise his hand in a signal so that the Presiding Officer of the meeting may observe that a member of the public wishes to speak, provided said individual completes and submits a public participation slip contemporaneously with speaking. The Village President need not open the agenda item to the public unless the public has indicated that it wishes to speak on that item. The speaker must be designated and authorized to speak by the Presiding Officer. Each speaker shall be requested to limit their public participation to a period of three minutes or less so that all persons shall have an adequate opportunity of making their statement to the corporate authorities. Such time limitations may be waived by the corporate authorities. The purpose of the public participation is to allow the public the opportunity of making a statement to the corporate authorities. Once an individual has spoken, that individual may not speak on that same agenda item again. Any limitation regarding addressing the Board may be waived by a majority vote of the Board of Trustees. In the absence of any objection by a member of the Board, the Village Manager may authorize a member of the village staff to address the Board. 
(1)  Those members of the public generally who have submitted a public participation slip or have raised their hand and subsequently submit a public participation slip. 
(2)  The petitioner or his/her representative. 
(3)  The Village Board. 
In addition to general discussion, the Village Board may question any speaker in regard to any agenda item. 
(L)  Rule 12. Temporary suspension of rules. These rules may be temporarily suspended by an affirmative vote of four Trustees. 
(M)  Rule 13. Readings of ordinances. Two readings of all ordinances shall be required before final action is taken thereon, and unless the provisions of this rule are first waived by the vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Trustees present in voting, no ordinance shall be passed until after the second reading thereof. Second reading shall not take place sooner than the next regular meeting of the Board of Trustees' meeting subsequent to the meeting wherein the ordinance is presented for first reading. In the event an ordinance fails to receive four affirmative votes on first reading, it shall nevertheless proceed to second reading for a final action thereof, if the majority of persons present at first reading have voted affirmatively. In the event less than a majority of persons present at first reading voted in favor of the ordinance, the ordinance shall not be required to appear for second reading unless written notice is received from two members of the corporate authorities requesting a second reading on the ordinance. 
(N)  Rule 14. Discussion of agenda items. Notwithstanding parliamentary law as contained in Robert's Rules of Order, when any agenda item is before the Board of Trustees, its Presiding Officer may allow a discussion and public participation prior to an official motion being made. This is not to be construed as a limitation of discussion by the Board of Trustees after the motion has been made. In all other cases not otherwise provided for by law or ordinance, the Board shall be guided by parliamentary law as contained in Robert's Rules of Order and any amendments thereto. 
(O)  Rule 15. Public participation at meetings of Committee of the Whole. Public participation shall be allowed at each Committee of the Whole meeting for a limited period of time. The public will be allowed to address or speak to any item on the Committee of the Whole agenda, but will not be recognized for any other purpose. The same procedure of identifying the speaker and completing a written participation slip as at a regular Board meeting shall be required.

§ 32.079 - Historical sites; designation and maintenance. 
(A)  The Lombard Historic Preservation Commission shall have the authority to recommend the designation or rejection of sites having a special historical or community interest or value, thereby making the designation as a "landmark site" or "landmark district". These designations shall be made only with the written approval of the property owners; however, written approval of the property owners shall not be required in the case of an "abandoned cemetery," as said term is defined in 65 ILCS 5/11-49-1(d), in the event that the owners of the abandoned cemetery are unknown, or no longer in existence. 
(B)  The Commission shall have the authority to conduct a survey of sites within the village which may be eligible for said designation and maintain a register thereof. This list may include single structures or sites, portions of structures, groups of structures, man-made or natural landscape elements, works of art, or integrated combinations thereof. 
(C)  In making its recommendation for said designation, the Commission shall consider the following criteria concerning such sites: 
(1)  The character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the village. 
(2)  The identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the cultural, economic, social, or historical development of the village. 
(3)  The architectural significance of a building which is at least 50 years of age and is a good example of a specific architectural style containing distinctive elements of design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship, or is an example of a style which had an impact on the community. Such a building must retain much of its original architectural integrity. 
(4)  The archeological importance of a site which has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in pre-history or history. 
(D)  Upon reaching a preliminary conclusion that a site meets one or more of the criteria contained in the above division, the Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the question of said proposed designation, setting forth a date, time, and place and causing written notice, by certified mail, to be given to all property owners of record of said property and to the public through a local newspaper, not more than 30 nor less than 15 days prior to said public hearing. 
(1)  The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner and according to such procedures as are prescribed by the above governing public hearings within the village, and by 65 ILCS 5/11-48.2-4. 
(2)  The Commission shall make a determination with respect to the proposed designation, in writing, 30 days after the hearing and shall forthwith transmit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees. 
(3)  If the Board of Trustees approves the designation, the Commission shall notify the Bureau of Inspectional Services and the Plan Commission of the official designation. The Commission shall also file with the County Recorder of Deeds and County Assessor a certified copy of the designation ordinance and send a certified copy of said ordinance and notice to the owner of record of said property by certified mail. 
(E)  (1)  The Commission shall have the authority to review all proposed alterations, regardless of whether or not they require a building permit. Alterations shall be defined as any work that results in changes in the exterior form, shape, or appearance of a building designated as a "landmark site" which thereby destroys its original architectural integrity. No alterations will be made and no building permit issued in regard to property classified as a "landmark site" to any applicant without a certificate of appropriateness from the Lombard Historic Preservation Commission in the following instances: 
(a)  Where such permit would allow the alteration or reconstruction of any building designated as a "landmark site"; 
(b)  Where such permit would allow the demolition of any building designated as a "landmark site", except that in the event of extensive damage because of fire, windstorm, or other natural causes, demolition shall be allowed upon the recommendation of the Building Commissioner; 
(c)  Where such a permit would allow the construction or erection of any addition to a building designated as a "landmark site"; or 
(d)  Where such permit would allow the erection of another building or buildings on property designated as a "landmark site." 
(2)  The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any alteration, removal in part, new construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, other modification of any building requiring a permit, shall consider among other things, the purpose of this subchapter, the historical and architectural value and significance of the "landmark site" or "landmark district", the exterior texture and/or material of the building or structure in question or its appurtenant fixtures, other buildings within a "landmark district", and the position of such building or structure in relation to the street or public way and to other buildings and structures. 
(3)  The Commission shall review an application for demolition and have the authority to delay said demolition for a period not to exceed six months, to enable the Commission to try to find a purchaser or alternate use for the building. 
(4)  Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior elements of any building or structure described as a "landmark site." 
Repairs shall be defined as any work where the purpose and effect of the work is to replace damaged or defective portions of a structure with like materials, thereby retaining the original architectural integrity. 
Ordinary maintenance shall be defined as any work for which a building permit is not required by law, where the purpose and effect of such work is to correct any deterioration, decay of, or damage to a structure or any part thereof and to restore the same, as nearly as may be practicable, to its condition prior to the occurrence of such deterioration, decay, or damage. 
(5)  Interiors of buildings are only included as part of the historical designation when specifically established in the siting ordinance. 
(F)  (1)  A certificate of appropriateness must precede the issuance of any permit in regard to property classified as a "landmark site." Application made to the Lombard Historic Preservation Commission must include copies of all detailed plans, designs, elevations, specifications, and documents relating thereto. The Commission shall meet with the applicant to approve, modify, or disapprove the application in whole or in part or suspend action. 
(2)  If the Commission finds the proposed work of a nature which meets the criteria established in division (E), it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness and forward it to the Building Commissioner. The Building Commissioner shall thereafter proceed with his own review of the application for a building permit. If the Commission finds that the proposed work does not meet the criteria, a certificate of appropriateness will not be issued. Written notice of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness, together with the reasons therefor, shall be given to the applicant. 
(G)  (1)  Regulations and orders of the Commission issued pursuant to this subchapter shall be enforced by the Building Commissioner. Violations shall be punished as set forth in § 32.999. 
(2)  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may, within 30 days after receipt by certified mail of the notice of denial, apply to the Board of Trustees of the village for a review of the Commission's decision. He shall file with the Village Clerk a written notice requesting the Board to review said decision. Should the Village Board agree with the aggrieved and override the Lombard Historic Preservation Commission's recommendation, its action would constitute an automatic removal of the "landmark site" designation. 
(3)  In the event that the landmark site designation is removed pursuant to subsection (2) above, any landmark site plaque, that was issued to the property owner by the Lombard Historic Preservation Commission, shall be returned to the Lombard Historic Preservation Commission by the property owner.

Upon the failure or refusal of such person(s) to comply with the notice, the Director may direct that appropriate proceeding commence to compel the abatement, or removal, of such a nuisance in any manner allowed by law, equity, or this Code and, or, authorizing the Department to act to abate, or remove, such nuisance. The person(s) having control of such premises, in addition to the other remedies provided by this Code, shall be liable to the Department for any costs incurred by the Department to effect such abatement, or removal, including reasonable attorney's fees and other costs of enforcement, to be recovered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(T)  Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this Code are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other applicable statute, law, code, regulation, or rule, the provision that is most restrictive or imposes the higher standards or requirements shall apply. The provisions of this Code shall be interpreted to be cumulative of, and to impose limitations in addition to, all other laws, codes, and regulations, in existence or which may be passed governing any subject matter of this Chapter. To the greatest extent possible, the provisions of this Code shall be construed to be consistent with, and not in conflict with, the provisions of such other laws, codes, and regulations, and with each other, to the end that all such provisions may be given their fullest application. 
(U)  The village is a willing participant in DuPage County's Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program, subject to an annual intergovernmental agreement. 
(V)  Any person aggrieved by any decision, ruling, or determination by the Director, or by any interpretation or application of any provision of this Code may appeal such matter. A written appeal of any decision made by the Director shall be made within seven days of the decision contested, excepting an appeal involving the assessment charge or calculation of any fine or penalty in which cases which an appeal shall be brought before said amount becomes 30 days past due.

A new source shall provide the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards, and estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(4)  In support of the baseline report, the industrial user shall submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following information: 
(a)  Name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owner(s). 
(b)  List of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(c)  Brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operations carried out by such user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
(d)  Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
(i)  Regulated process streams, and 
(ii)  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR Section 403.6(e). 
(e)  The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process, and shall: 
(i)  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
(ii)  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Control Authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
(iii)  Sample based on the flow of the sampled stream, as follows (composite samples are required where feasible): 
(iv)  Take the samples immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, in order to evaluate compliance with the national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR Section 403.6 (e). Where an alternate concentration has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW. 
(v)  Submit, only with POTW authorization, a baseline report which utilizes only historical data, so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
(vi)  Provide, for each report, the time, date, and place, of sampling and methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(f)  The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance measures or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards. 
(g)  If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance measures will be required to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance measures. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. 
(i)  Where the industrial user's national categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Section 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations (40 CFR Section 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline report the information required in Section 400.115 (a)(4)(F) and (G) shall pertain to the modified limits. 
(ii)  If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as a response to Section 400.115(a)(4)(F) and (G) and submit them to the POTW within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
(h)  The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in response to Section 400.115(a)(4)(G): 
(i)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction). 
(ii)  No increment referred to in Section 400.115(a)(4)(H)(i) shall exceed nine months. 
(iii)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the POTW including, at a minimum whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the POTW. 
(i)  Such other information as may be reasonably requested the POTW. 
(C)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, introduction by the new source of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards shall submit to the Manager a report, on forms provided by the POTW, indicating the nature of the concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional user operation and maintenance or pretreatment techniques or installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional. 
(D)  Periodic compliance reports for significant industrial users. 
(1)  All significant industrial users subject to an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such applicable national categorical pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, after discharge of wastewater to the POTW begins, shall submit to the POTW during the months of June and December for the preceding two calendar quarters unless required more frequently in the national categorical pretreatment standard or by the POTW or IEPA, a certified report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such applicable national categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. 
(2)  At the discretion of the POTW the significant industrial user not subject to national categorical pretreatment standards shall sample, analyze, and report pollutants during the months of June and December, or more frequently, as determined and required by the Manager with any conditions he deems necessary. 
(3)  At the discretion of the POTW and in consideration of such factors as a local flow rate, holidays, and budget cycles, the POTW may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted. 
(E)  All wastewater discharge applications, baseline monitoring reports, and user compliance reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification statement: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction and supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."

(A)  Any property owner who desires to possibly have the village pay for the cost of the mechanical rodding of a sewer service line shall comply with and abide by the following requirements: 
(1)  The owners shall notify the Public Works Department of a sewer backup in progress. 
(2)  The village will verify that the backup is not as a result of a problem with the main sewer line under the jurisdiction of the village. If the backup is not as a result of a problem with the main sewer line, the property owner shall either contact the plumber under contract with the village, or hire a plumber of the property owner's choosing, to perform a mechanical rodding. A representative of the village must be present to witness the mechanical rodding for plumbers not under contract with the village. 
(3)  If mechanical rodding clears the sewer service line, and roots or a collapsed pipe in the sewer stub were not the problem, the mechanical rodding shall be deemed a cleaning, no monetary reimbursement shall be made to the property owner as a result of the mechanical rodding, and the property owner shall be responsible for paying the plumber for the cost of the said mechanical rodding. 
(4)  If the mechanical rodding reveals that the sewer backup was a result of roots or a collapsed pipe in the sewer stub, and the property owner has hired the plumber under contract with the village, the plumber under contract with the village shall bill the village for the cost of the mechanical rodding at the price as set forth in said plumber's contract with the village. 
(5)  If the mechanical rodding reveals that the sewer backup was a result of roots or a collapsed pipe in the sewer stub, and the property owner has hired a plumber other than the plumber under contract with the village, the village shall reimburse the property owner for the actual cost of the mechanical rodding, not to exceed the amount that would have been charged by the plumber under contract with the village. 
(B)  A repair to the sewer stub shall be performed by the village, unless the Public Works Department authorizes the plumber chosen by the property owner to perform said repair in conjunction with a repair to the private sewer service, with any repair to the sewer stub being at the village's cost. A repair to the private sewer service shall be performed by a plumber chosen by the property owner at said property owner's cost.

§ 75.03 - Seizure and impoundment of motor vehicles. 
(A)  Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this Chapter, the police officer shall cause the motor vehicle to be removed or towed to a facility authorized by the village. When the vehicle is towed, the village shall notify or make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner of record, lessee, or person identifying himself or herself as the owner or lessee of the vehicle, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the owner of record's or lessee's right to request a preliminary hearing and to participate in a plea/evidentiary hearing, as provided in this Chapter. The village shall also provide notice that the motor vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in this Chapter, unless the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle, or a lien holder of record of the motor vehicle, posts with the village a cash bond and pays all towing and storage fees, as set forth in § 75.04 below. 
(B)  A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this Chapter shall first ascertain whether the seizure and impoundment is necessary and reasonable under the circumstances. If in the judgment of the police officer then present, a person authorized by the owner of record or the operator of the motor vehicle is present and capable to provide for the lawful immediate removal of the motor vehicle, and said motor vehicle is not required to be held as evidence in regard to the violation, the police officer shall allow that individual to promptly remove the motor vehicle without it being subject to seizure and impoundment if seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is discretionary pursuant to § 75.02(H) above or seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is contemplated pursuant to §§ 75.02(A) through (H) above. 
(Ord. 6679, passed 2/16/2012) 
§ 75.04 - Posting a bond. 
    If a bond in the amount of $500.00 is posted with the village, the impounded motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record, upon the payment by the owner of record of the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to § 75.06(B) below, the bond shall be applied to said fee; provided, in the event that a violation of this section is not proven, the bond shall be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village until a hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is judicial review pursuant to § 75.10, until a reviewing court issues a final decision. 
§ 75.05 - Preliminary hearing. 
    Where the owner of record of a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of this Chapter makes a request, in writing and filed with the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee, for a preliminary hearing within 12 hours after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee must conduct a preliminary hearing within 24 hours after the request for a preliminary hearing is received by the village; provided that if the date for the preliminary hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, the following shall apply: 
(A)  All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing. 
(B)  The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary hearing, and hearsay testimony shall be allowed, and shall be admissible. 
(C)  If, after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee determines that there is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as provided in § 75.02 above, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee shall order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle, unless the owner of record of the motor vehicle posts a cash bond with the village in the amount of $500.00, and pays the towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, as set forth in § 75.04 above. 
(D)  If the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee determines that there is not probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as provided in § 75.02 above, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record of the motor vehicle without any fees or other costs, but the owner of record shall be responsible to pay any towing or storage charges to the applicable tow company. 
§ 75.06 - Plea hearing/evidentiary hearing. 
(A)  Notice of hearing. Within ten days after a motor vehicle is impounded pursuant to this Chapter, the village shall notify the owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of record, of the date, time and location of a plea hearing that shall be conducted, pursuant to this section. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and First Class U.S. Mail to the owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of record, as shown on the records of the Illinois Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail or First Class U.S. Mail need not be given when the owner of record of the motor vehicle, any lessee and any lien holder of record have been personally served with notice, in written form, of the time, date and location of the plea hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer, designated by the Village Manager. The owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of record shall appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, or if the owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of record fail to appear, the case shall be disposed of at that time, with an order/default order in favor of the village, which order/default order shall require the payment to the village of the $500.00 administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record, any lessee or lien holder of record pays to the village the $500.00 administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the owner of record, any lessee or any lien holder of record pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled and held no later than 45 days after the motor vehicle was impounded, unless continued by the hearing officer. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing. At any time prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either the village, the owner of record, any lessee or lien holder of record, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the evidentiary hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the evidentiary hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. 
(B)  If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in § 75.02 above, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount of $500.00, and require the motor vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner of record pays the administrative fee to the village, plus applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company. The $500.00 administrative fee shall be a debt due to the village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to § 75.04 or § 75.05(c) above, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If the owner of record fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village, which order shall require the payment to the village of the $500.00 administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record pays to the village the $500.00 administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the hearing officer finds no such violation occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of the owner of record's motor vehicle without any fee or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously been posted, the cash bond shall be returned, but the owner of record shall be responsible for any towing or storage charges to the applicable tow company. All orders entered by the hearing officer under this subsection shall be in writing. 
(C)  At the evidentiary hearing, the violation citation shall be prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in the citation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to prove that the violation was not committed. 
(D)  If the hearing officer finds that the village exceeds its authority under this chapter in the seizures and impoundment of a motor vehicle, the village shall be liable to the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorney's fees. 
(Ord. 6679, passed 2/21/12; Ord. No. 7292, § 1, passed 11-3-16) 
§ 75.07 - Disposition of impounded motor vehicles. 
(A)  If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within 35 days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearings provided in § 75.06 above, or who admits guilt at the plea hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provide by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/1-100, et seq., as amended. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company are not paid within 35 days after the expiration of time by which administrative review of the Hearing Officer's determination may be sought pursuant to § 75.10 below, or within 35 days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the village, whichever is applicable, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provide by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/1-100, et seq., as amended. 
(B)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner of record, lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a motor vehicle impounded under this Chapter until the administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company imposed pursuant to this Chapter have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded motor vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative fee, plus the applicable towing and storage costs. 
(C)  Costs for towing and storage of a motor vehicle pursuant to this Chapter shall be those approved by the Chief of Police for all tow companies authorized to tow for the Police Department. 
(Ord. 6679, passed 2/16/12) 
§ 75.08 - Applicability of other laws. 
    This Chapter is in addition to and shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing State or Federal laws or any ordinance that relates to the seizure or impoundment of motor vehicles, and any fee provided for in this Chapter shall be in addition to any and all penalties that may be assessed or imposed by a court for any criminal charges. This section shall not apply: 
(A)  if the motor vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time of the violation and verifiable proof of the theft is provided to the village; 
(B)  if the motor vehicle is operated as a common carrier as defined by applicable law and the violation occurs without the knowledge of the person in control of the motor vehicle; or 
(C)  if the motor vehicle is subject to successful forfeiture proceedings under 725 ILCS 150/1, et seq., as amended ("Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act"); 720 ILCS 5/36-1, et seq., as amended ("Seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles and aircraft"); or other state or federal forfeiture laws. 
(Ord. 6679, passed 2/16/12) 
§ 75.09 - Use of fees collected. 
    All fees collected by the village pursuant to this Chapter shall only be deposited and used for village traffic safety and enforcement expenditures and for the expenses of the village's administrative adjudication program.

Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this chapter which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Act, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners. 
(4)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(G)  Revised permit drawings. 
    In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this section, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with subsection (U) of this section. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(H)  Insurance. 
(1)  Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in subsections (a) and (b) below:

(2)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this subsection (H) may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(3)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this subsection (H) to the village within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the village. 
(4)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this subsection (H) shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this subsection (H).

A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (H)(1) above, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(6)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this subsection (H) shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(7)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

(J)  Security. 
(1)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this subsection (J). The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this subsection (J) at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for: 
(a)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this section; 
(b)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this section; and 
(c)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this section including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this section to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this section or any other applicable law. 
(2)  Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village.

(a)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(b)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and 
(c)  Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(3)  Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (3) for any single phase. 
(4)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection (4), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished. 
(b)  Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition. 
(3)  Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means. 
(4)  Chemical use. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) below, no utility shall spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or disease. 
(b)  Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that such spraying is the only practicable method of vegetation control. 
(R)  Removal, relocation, or modifications of utility facilities. 
(1)  Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way. 
(2)  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(a)  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(b)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(c)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this section; or 
(d)  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise. 
(3)  Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(4)  Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of Public Works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person. 
(S)  Clean-up and restoration. 
(1)  The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the Director of Public Works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be extended by the Director of Public Works for good cause shown. 
(2)  The work of final restoration including both paving surface and paving base shall be performed directly by the permittee in accordance with the requirements of the village's Public Works Department within two weeks of the completion of work in the opening or by the permit expiration date, whichever occurs first, unless winter weather conditions delay such permanent restoration.

(T)  Maintenance and emergency maintenance. 
(1)  General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense. 
(2)  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
(a)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(b)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately. 
(c)  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public. 
(3)  Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair.

(2)  Authority to grant variances. The Director of Public Works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this section identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
(3)  Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
(a)  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(b)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(4)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this section but which carry out the purposes of this section. 
(5)  Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director of Public Works under the provisions of this section, shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Village Board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the appeal. 
(V)  Penalties. 
    Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to fine in accordance with the general penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this section. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. 
(W)  Enforcement. 
    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this section. 
(X)  Severability. 
    If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this section is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

(Ord. 2823, passed 2-13-86) 
§ 97.129 - Wiring test. 
(A)  The tests outlined in this section are field tests required to be performed in the presence of the village representative. They shall be performed by the contractor's personnel and equipment. Defects shall be corrected and testing repeated until all sections of the installation are sound. Splicing or repairing of insulation below grade is not permissible except in a handhole. 
(B)  All construction shall be finished when tests are made. The poles shall be erected, with ballasts and lamps in place. Trenches shall be backfilled and all connections shall be made up. 
(C)  Insulation resistance shall be measured with a megger generating not less than 500 or more than 1000 volts. A multimeter is not acceptable because it applies only a few volts which will permit some insulation defects to go undetected. Erratic behavior of the megger during the test indicates an intermittent weakness which must be corrected. Only the lower value indicated shall be considered or recorded. 
(D)  The village representative shall log the serial number and voltage rating of the megger used by the contractor. He shall then confirm the calibration of the megger by connecting the two leads of the megger together so that the resistance to be measured by the megger when it is turned at full speed is zero. Unless this is true, the megger will give false reading under all other circumstances as well. 
(E)  Each circuit shall be permanently tagged for identification and then tested at the control centers. The full voltage of the megger shall be applied between ground and each insulated wire in each circuit. The ground shall consist of a driven, copper-clad rod eight feet by five-eighths inch or larger connected by number eight wire to the power company ground in the control cabinet. Circuits shall be isolated from each other by opening the circuit breakers. 
(F)  The minimum, acceptable resistance to ground shown by the megger shall be as follows: 
Wire Tested Minimum Megger 
Resistance to Ground To power source 40 megohms minimum To photocell 40 megohms minimum 1 or 2 lights connected to wire being tested 40 megohms minimum 3 or 4 lights connected to wire being tested 20 megohms minimum 5 to 8 lights connected to wire being tested 10 megohms minimum 9 or more lights connected to wire being tested 5 megohms minimum  
The megger shall be operating at full crank speed when it is read. If needle fluctuates, the lowest resistance value shall be recorded. 
(G)  If any conductor has less resistance than that shown in division (F), it shall be rejected regardless of atmosphere, ground water, or other condition which may be alleged to be the reason. Defective cables shall be replaced and retested until satisfactory. 
(H)  Voltage regulation and current balance tests: It is the purpose of these tests to confirm the design values of voltage drop and the accuracy of the installed wiring layout. The test shall be performed in the sequence given as rapidly as possible except for the five minute warm-up. Only one voltmeter and one ammeter shall be used to eliminate discrepancies between instruments. The instruments shall not be adjusted after testing begins. 
(1)  Turn lights on and record "starting" current in supply phase wires A and B. 
(2)  After lights are on the five minutes: 
(a)  Record "operating" current in phase wires A and B. 
(b)  Record phase voltage. 
(c)  Record voltage across ballast in handhole in end light of circuit designated by engineer. 
(d)  Record voltage of same circuit at control center to determine voltage drop between end lamp and control center. 
(e)  Record current in each lighting circuit. 
Note that the form suggested for these records is on the following page, and where it is necessary, change phase wire identification to indicate phase C on the record of tests.

§ 97.143 - Exemption. 
    This subchapter shall not apply to streets within the village under repair or replacement by a governmental body. 
(Ord. 2773, passed 8-29-85) 
§ 97.200 - Permits required for the movement of overweight and/or over-dimension vehicles on the streets of Lombard. 
(A)  A permit shall be required for the movement of any vehicle and/or nondivisible load (one which cannot be reasonably disassembled) or combination of vehicles on roadways and bridges within the jurisdiction of the village which exceeds the following limits: 
(1)  Maximum gross weight: More than 80,000 pounds; 
(2)  Maximum gross length: More than 60 feet (truck tractor-semitrailer, truck tractor semitrailer-semitrailer, or combinations specifically designed to transport motor vehicles or boats), or more than 55 feet (truck tractor in combination with a semitrailer);

(4)  Maximum gross height: More than 13 feet, six inches; 
(5)  Maximum axle weight limit : 20,000 pounds; 
(6)  Maximum axle tandem weight limit : 34,000 pounds. 
However, access on village streets within one mile of I-355 and I-88 within the village limits is permitted, as required by the Illinois Vehicle Code, to those vehicles meeting maximum weights and dimensions and for those purposes, as the Vehicle Code allows. With respect to those roadways and bridges under construction, road closures with or without signage do not exempt overweight and or overdimension movements from permit requirements when any traffic is allowed through construction zone(s) and when the movement is made by applicant(s) not performing construction on the roadways closed. In an emergency declared by resolution of the Village Board, the requirement to obtain permits may be waived. 
Exempt from permits are the following: 
1.  Fire department vehicles; 
2.  Those vehicles operating under an emergency declaration; 
3.  Village owned vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair; 
4.  Equipment used for snow and ice removal owned or operated by any governmental body; 
5.  Equipment owned and operated by a private contractor used in the construction of public works for the Village of Lombard. 
(B)  Permits shall be issued only in the name of a person, firm, business, or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or that operates the vehicle under a bona-fide lease agreement. 
The permit is non-transferable and applies only to the permittee. 
All applications for permits shall be given full consideration. Permits for proposed moves may be issued: 
1.  When the Village roadways and bridges will not be unduly damaged; and 
2.  When the safety of the traveling public will be adequately protected. 
Application for a permit to move an oversized and or overweight vehicle, and/or load, must be made to the traffic unit of the Village of Lombard's Police Department. The following information shall be included on the permit: 
1.  Name, address and phone number of the applicant and the applicant's business, name, address and phone number; 
2.  Whether the permit is for a single trip, round trip, or for multiple moves. 
3.  Whether the applicant is an authorized carrier under the Illinois Motor Carrier of Property Law and if so, the registration and certificate number issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission; 
4.  The description of the vehicle and/or load making the move; 
5.  The routing, including points of origin and destination; 
6.  Whether the vehicle and/or load are being transported for hire; 
7.  The Illinois Department of Transportation's state permit number; 
8.  The vehicle's and/or trailer's registration number, state and year; 
9.  The Village of Lombard's permit number. 
The village may issue revisions to permits: 
1.  To correct an error attributed to the village; 
2.  To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered before the move; 
3.  To adjust weights, dimension or routes as issued on the permit before the move is made. 
Any revisions made at the request of the permittee for purposes of changing weights dimensions, routes or load description shall be made before any move is made at a cost of $25.00 per permit. 
(C)  The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take place as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the village any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. 
The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of village roads, and any vehicle and or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the driver's possession at all times unless otherwise directed by the traffic unit and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purposes of inspection. 
If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, property moved, bridges or highways analysis performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
(D)  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
1.  A one-way or single trip movement means one move from the point of origin to the point of destination. Any additional stops between the point of origin and the point of destination are expressly prohibited. Single trips permits are effective for five consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the traffic unit. 
2.  Round trip movement means two trips over the same route in opposite directions. Round trip permits are effective for ten consecutive days from the date of issuance. 
3.  Multiple moves are those in such close proximity to each other in distance or in time, that the traffic unit would consider incorporating two or more permit moves as one move. Multiple move permits when granted by the traffic unit shall be for a period time not to exceed 30 days from the date of issuance. Multiple moves must be identified prior to obtain a permit. 
4.  Limited continuous use movements are movements generally to one site over a period of three months made by over dimension vehicles which do not exceed the weight limits in section (A) herein. Limited Continuous Use Permits may be issued for up to ten trips generally to the same site during the time period allowed. 
(E)  Police escorts are required for certain vehicles and loads as indicated in subsection (I) herein. The total number of officers necessary to provide for a safe move shall be determined by the traffic unit, based upon the size and weight of the permit move. Fees for escorts shall be in addition to the permit fees set forth herein. Fees for said escort shall be $50.00 an hour per officers assigned and shall provide for a minimum of two hours of service. 
(F)  The permittee shall assume total liability for any and all damages to streets, bridges, village owned appurtenances and private or public property while engaged in a permit movement. The measure of liability is the cost for all repairs or replacement of property damaged by the permittee. 
(G)  The permittee shall indemnify and hold harmless the village from any costs, judgments or settlements, including attorneys' fees, arising from physical injuries, including loss of life, or damage to or loss of property related to acts or omissions by permittee, its officers, agents or employees, pursuant to the permit. Upon application for a permit(s), each applicant shall provide evidence of a valid comprehensive general liability insurance policy, with an insurance company approved by the village, for protection against personal injury or property damage, in the amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence. The Village of Lombard must be added as a certificate holder. The failure to keep a certificate of insurance on file with the village, evidencing that the required insurance is in full force and effect and that the Village of Lombard is a certificate holder, shall render a permit issued under this section null and void. 
(H)  Permits are void if altered for the purpose of deception. The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a privilege by the village and may be denied, suspended or revoked for such reasons as the village may deem related to its governmental interests including but not limited to: 
1.  A permittee's knowingly providing incorrect information in an application for a permit; 
2.  A permittee, its agents or employees acting on a permit which has been altered for purposes of deception; 
3.  Non-compliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal, state or local laws pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of a vehicle engaged in the transport of goods; 
4.  Moving on village streets without a valid permit as is required under this section. 
In addition to other remedies the village may seek, a permittee, its officers, agents or employees, found guilty of moving an over-dimension or overweight vehicle or load on village streets on a permit altered for purposes of deception, or without a valid permit as is required under this section, shall be subject to a $1,000.00 fine for each day during which a move was so made. 
Suspension or revocation of a current permit shall be for the time determined appropriate by the traffic unit; however, reinstatement may be made upon conditions determined by the village and payment of all outstanding settlements or judgments. The charges for reinstatement are: 
Denial ..... No charge 
Suspended ..... $150.00 
Revoked ..... $200.00 
The traffic unit shall administer and enforce this section and shall have the authority to grant, deny, suspend, revoke and reinstate permits. Any applicant or permittee denied a permit or who has had a permit suspended or revoked, upon request, shall be given a hearing before the traffic unit of the Village Police Department and, if applicant or permittee desires, may appeal the decision of the traffic unit in a hearing before the Village Manager. 
(I)  The village with respect to highways under its jurisdiction shall collect a fee as shown herein from applicants for the issuance of a permit to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicle(s), and/or loads, which fit the categories shown below.

2.  A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the Director of Public Works to allow wireless facilities to be located above ground in an area where village ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if the wireless provider can establish that: 
a.  Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-way; and 
b.  An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area; and 
c.  An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety hazard; and 
d.  An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies; and 
e.  Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the above ground wireless facility at the proposed location; and 
f.  An above ground wireless facility at the proposed location will not create a safety hazard; and 
g.  The above ground wireless facility is located and designed in such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and 
h.  In any historical area, that the above ground wireless facility will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area. 
3.  Screening for ground mounted facilities. Where a ground-mounted facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer. Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan. 
4.  Future undergrounding: The village may, from time to time, make a decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of the village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the village shall either: 
a.  Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of the small wireless facility; or 
b.  Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole so it can maintain service from that location. 
F.  Collocation limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
    However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
    For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
G.  Code compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.

(A)  Definitions: 
    As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Amount paid means the amount charged to the taxpayer's service address in the village regardless of where such amount is billed or paid. 
    Department means the Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the village and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid, gross charges for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel point within the village, charges for the channel mileage between each channel point within the village, and charges for that portion of the interstate inter-office channel provided within Illinois. However, gross charge shall not include: 
(a)  Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by this section, (ii) the tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act; 
(b)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside the village; 
(c)  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content.

(f)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this section has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
(g)  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made); or 
(h)  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices; 
    Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this state. 
    Intrastate telecommunications means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within the state. 
    Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the Federal and state governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city, town, village, county, or other political subdivision of this state. 
    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnished adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state. 
    Sale at retail means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale. 
    Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, service address shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the village and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this section. 
    Telecommunications, in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this section, private line means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of telecommunications shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. Telecommunications shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered telecommunications subject to the tax imposed under this section. For purposes of this section, prepaid telephone calling arrangements means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailer's Occupation Tax Act. 
(B)  Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed. 
    A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all of the following acts or privileges: 
(1)  The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the village intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. 
(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state. 
(3)  The tax imposed by this section is not imposed on any act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the village. 
(C)  Collection of tax by retailers: 
(1)  The tax authorized by this section shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this section and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this section shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(2)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications. 
(D)  Returns to department: 
    On or before the last day of August 2004, and on or before the last day of every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this section on telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement the Illinois Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act. 
(E)  Resellers: 
(1)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this section on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(2)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person having discontinued the making of resales. 
(3)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(F)  Severability: 
    If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision of this section, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall not affect other provisions of this section, or their application, that can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this section. 
(G)  Effective date: 
    This section shall be in full force and effect from and after its adoption and approval and publication in pamphlet form as required by law, provided, however, that: 
(1)  Subsections (B) and (C), and the tax provided for therein, shall take effect for all bills issued on or after July 1, 2004; and 
(2)  Any amounts due or payable to the village for any tax periods ending prior to the first day of July, 2004, shall nevertheless remain payable pursuant to Title 9, Chapter 98, §§ 98.80 through 98.90 and Title 11, Chapter 126 of the Village Code, as converted by operation of law to the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax on January 1, 2003, pursuant to Public Act 92-0526, as if this section had not be adopted.

§ 112.20 - Transfer. 
(A)  A license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for a period not to exceed six months after issuance unless sooner revoked as in this Chapter provided, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution, nor shall it be alienable or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated. Such license shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, but it shall cease upon death of the licensee, provided that executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor may continue the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor under order of the appropriate court and may exercise the privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of such decedent, or such insolvency or bankruptcy until the expiration of such license, but not longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy, or insolvency of such licensee. No refund shall be made of that portion of the license fees paid for any period in which the licensee shall be prevented from operating under such license in accordance with provisions of this division. 
(B)  Any licensee may apply for reissuance of his license at the expiration thereof, provided he is then qualified to receive a license and the premises for which such reissue license is sought are suitable for such purposes; and provided further that the reissue privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested right which shall in any case prevent the Liquor Commissioner from decreasing the number of licenses to be issued within its jurisdiction. 
(C)  In the event of a change of the application information required in § 112.11, such change shall be reported upon reissuance and the local Liquor Commissioner may then reject such application for reissuance in writing within 45 days of the application for reissuance. 
(D)  When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, the license shall terminate whenever 50 percent or more of the ownership interest therein changes from that shown on the original license application. In such event, the partnership, limited liability company or corporation, through its partners, managers or officers, must make application for the issuance of a new license as provided herein; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply where the transfer of an ownership interest is made to an owner shown on the original license application who owned 50 percent or more of the ownership interest of such partnership, limited liability company or corporation at the time the original license application was filed with the village. 
(E)  When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, no change in ownership from that shown on the original application involving the addition of a new partner(s) of such partnership, a new member(s) of such limited liability company who will own in the aggregate a five percent or more ownership interest in said limited liability company, or a new shareholder(s) of such corporation who will own in the aggregate more than five of the stock of such corporation, shall be effective until such proposed change in ownership has first been reported in writing to the Local Liquor Commissioner and said Local Liquor Commissioner finds that the proposed new partner(s) member(s) or shareholder(s) is/are not ineligible under the provisions of § 112.11 of this Chapter and so advises the licensee in writing. Any change in ownership without complying with the terms hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or revocation of the liquor license issued to such partnership, limited liability company or corporation. 
(F)  When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, no change in ownership from that shown on the original application involving the withdrawal of any partner(s), member(s) or shareholder(s) shall be made without reporting such change in ownership in writing to the Local Liquor Commissioner within ten days of any such change in ownership.

(1)  The grantee has substantially complied with material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; 
(2)  The quality of the grantee's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the System, has been reasonable in the light of community needs;

(A)  Within 14 days following the receipt of the request for site location approval, the President, with the advice and consent of the Board of Trustees shall appoint a Hearing Officer to serve during any public hearing concerning an application for site location approval.

§ 128.04 - Procedure for filing an application for approval of a pollution control facility. 
(A)  (1)  To request siting approval for a new PCF within Lombard's jurisdiction, an applicant must file an application with the Village Clerk, with, unless otherwise authorized by the President and Board of Trustees pursuant to subsection 128.04(A)(2) below, a minimum of 20 copies of the application and the substance of the applicant's proposal showing sufficient details describing the proposed facility to demonstrate compliance with the Act and Board regulations, including all site plans, engineering including calculations, exhibits and maps, and all documents, if any, to be submitted to the IEPA as of the date of filing the application. In addition, the applicant shall also provide one electronic version to the Village Clerk. At a minimum, the application shall comply with the Rules and Procedures. The form of said application may be obtained from the Lombard Village Clerk. 
(2)  A simple majority of the President and Board of Trustees may, prior to receipt of a particular request for site location approval hereunder, reduce the number of copies of such request, or particular portions thereof, which must be submitted under subsection 128.04(A)(1). Such reductions may be granted upon the written motion of a person who has, pursuant to Section 39.2(b) of the Act, filed a notice of intent to submit an application for location approval, which notice has also advised the recipients of the applicant's intention to move for a copies reduction under this section. Such reductions motion must be filed with the Clerk at least five calendar days prior to a regularly scheduled President and Board of Trustees meeting. The moving party must submit a certified copy of the notice of intent, and demonstrate that: compliance with the copies requirement of subsection 128.04(A)(1) will be inordinately expensive, without commensurate benefit to the village and the public; and that the proposed copies reduction will not work any fundamental unfairness on the village or the public, in their ability to review, and prepare for the hearing on the location approval application. The President and Board of Trustees shall act upon the motion expeditiously and may act upon the request for copies reduction at its first regular meeting after filing of the motion. 
(3)  In addition to the foregoing, the applicant shall deposit with the Village Clerk at the time of filing the application for site approval of a new PCF a filing fee deposit in the form of a certified or cashier's check of $250,000.00, except that a filing fee deposit of $500,000.00 is required if said proposed facility is designed as a hazardous waste disposal site or if the disposal or volume reduction of any waste will be by incineration or burning. If the applicant elects to file an amended application for site location approval for any PCF in accordance with this Chapter 128, such filing shall be accompanied by payment of a supplemental fee of $50,000.00. 
The applicable filing fee is intended to defray the reasonable and necessary costs of processing the application, including, but not limited to: costs of site inspection, clerical expenses, copying costs, space rental, Hearing Officer compensation, court reporter expenses, transcription costs, public notice expenses, staff review time, if any, Village Attorney and village consultants (such as qualified professional engineers, planners, appraisers, environmental counsel, etc.) (including tests, exhibits, and testimony, if any, provided by said consultants), and other relevant costs incident to the consideration of an application, the costs incident to preparing the record for appeal, and the cost of representing the village on appeal in case of an appeal of a President and Board of Trustees decision (the "village costs"). Should the village incur any additional costs in excess of the applicable filing fee deposit, the applicant shall bear any and all such additional costs and shall promptly pay over such additional amount to the village upon request or demand. If at any time the funds deposited by the applicant are reduced below $50,000.00, the applicant shall deposit an additional $50,000.00. 
If there are funds remaining in the filing fee deposit after payment of the village costs, such amount shall be refunded to the applicant upon the final resolution of the application process (including appeals to the Illinois Pollution Control Board, Appellate Court, Illinois Supreme Court, Federal Courts, and administrative review in the Courts, if any). 
The application must be complete, with answers provided for each question on the application form. The application must contain consecutively numbered pages and it must be accompanied by all site plans, exhibits, maps and documents required by this Chapter 128 and by the rules and procedures. The date that the applicant files a complete application in proper form, together with the applicable filing fee deposit, with the Village Clerk shall be considered the official filing date for all time limit purposes. The application is not effective unless the application is in strict compliance with this Chapter 128, the rules and procedures and with the Act. If upon review of the application within 21 days of its submittal it is determined by the village to be incomplete and not in strict conformance with the aforesaid, the application is deemed not filed and the filing fee (less village costs and expenses) shall be returned to the applicant. Failure of the village to reject a request for site approval is not, and shall not be deemed, acceptance of the form or substance of the request, and the applicant remains solely responsible to demonstrate that the location approval criteria are all met. At any time prior to completion by the applicant of the presentation of the applicant's factual evidence and an opportunity for cross-questioning by the Hearing Officer, village representatives and any participants, the applicant may file not more than one amended application upon payment of additional fees pursuant to Section 39.2(k) of the Act and subsection 128.04 (A)(3) of this Chapter 128. Provided, however, that the time limitation for final action set forth in Section 39.2(e) of the Act and subsection 128.07(B) of this Chapter 128 shall be extended for an additional period of 90 days. 
(4)  If, prior to making a final local siting decision, the village has negotiated and entered into a host agreement with the applicant, the terms and conditions of the host agreement, whether written or oral, shall be disclosed and made a part of the hearing record for that local siting proceeding. In the case of an oral agreement, the disclosure shall be made in the form of a written summary jointly prepared and submitted by the village and the applicant and shall describe the terms and conditions of the oral agreement.

The consultants and the village departments shall then commence a study of the application. The applicant shall cooperate fully with the consultants and the technical staff of the village in their review of the application, including providing access to the site for study or testing, including but not limited to geophysical testing. 
(C)  A copy of the application and all related documents or other materials on file with the Village Board of Trustees shall be made available for public inspection in the office of the Village Clerk during normal business hours. Members of the public shall be allowed to obtain a copy of said application or any part thereof upon payment of the actual cost of reproduction as outlined in the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1, et seq.)

(2)  The applicant shall serve such written notice upon each member of the general assembly from the legislative district in which the proposed facility is to be located, and this notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located.

F = 18C (A to the 0.5 power) (1.10) 
(H)\(S) (E) 
Where F = minimum required fire flow in gpm 
C = 1.5 for wood frame construction 
1.0 for joisted masonry 
0.9 for heavy timber type buildings 
0.8 for noncombustible construction 
0.6 for fire-resistive construction 
A = Total floor area (all stories, excluding basement). For fire-resistive buildings, consider the six largest successive floor areas. 
Fire flow shall not exceed: 
8,000 gpm for wood frame construction 
8,000 gpm for joisted masonry 
6,000 gpm for non-combustible construction 
4,500 gpm for fire-resistive construction 
H = Hazard

(A)  The Fire Department shall test or witness tests to determine fire flow. 
(B)  The test required by subsection (A) above shall be conducted and the flow calculated according to the following provisions: 
(1)  Available fire flow will be determined by conducting a single fire hydrant flow in conjunction with residual pressure reading from a hydrant on the same main. The Fire Department shall determine which fire hydrants will be used for flow and residual readings. The following data will be recorded: 
(a)  Date and time of day; 
(b)  Hydrant locations; 
(c)  Normal operating pressure; 
(d)  Flow pressure; and 
(e)  Residual pressure. 
(2)  Hydrant flow shall be calculated based upon a standard co-efficient of friction of .9 for 21/2-inch orifice or .756 for 41/2-inch orifice unless otherwise determined by the Fire Chief. 
(3)  Available water shall be calculated by the following chart or formula: 
The formula for available water is: 
A.W. @ 20 PSI residual = Square Root of D2 / D1 
Where Q = Total gpm during the flow 
D2 = The normal operating pressure minus 20 psi 
D1 = The normal operating pressure minus residual pressure during the flow. 
If the answer is greater than Q, add ten percent of the difference to the answer. If the answer is less than Q, subtract ten percent of the difference from the answer. 
(4)  The residual hydrant will be the most remote hydrant in relation to the risk if an interior main system or the closest street hydrant to the risk.

ARTICLE XXIX. - RADIO AMPLIFICATION SYSTEMS IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS 

§ 150.350 - Radio coverage. 
(A)  Except as otherwise provided in § 150.360 below, no person shall erect, construct, maintain or modify any building or structure or any part thereof, or cause the same to be done in such a manner which fails to support adequate radio coverage within said building or structure for Village of Lombard public safety services, including, but not limited to, emergency management, police, fire and public works services. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued for any building or structure which fails to comply with this requirement. 
(B)  The frequency range, which must be supported, shall be 150-160 MHzFD, 450-480 MHzPD, 746-776 MHz, and 794-806 MHz, or as otherwise established and required in writing by the village as being necessary for public safety purposes. 
(C)  For purposes of §§ 150.350-150.361 of this Code, adequate radio coverage shall be defined as a minimum signal level of DAQ (Delivered Audio Quality 3) available in 95 percent of the area as agreed to be in the coverage acceptance test plan by the Village of Lombard and the radio system manufacturer prior to system testing. 
(Ord. 5847, passed 5/4/06) 
§ 150.351 - Radio amplification system allowed. 
(A)  Buildings and structures may be equipped with any of the following, in order to achieve adequate radio coverage: 
(1)  A radiating cable system; 
(2)  An internal multiple antenna system with FCC Type Accepted Bi-Directional VHF and UHF Amplifiers as needed to encompass the frequency range stated in subsection 150.350(B) above or frequency range subsequently established by the village; or 
(3)  A system that has been approved by the village as being capable of providing amplification to meet the requirements of §§ 150.350-150.361 of this Code. 
(B)  The radio amplification system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least 12 hours without external power input. The battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of external power input. There shall be no connection between the radio amplification system and the fire alarm system. 
(Ord. 5847, passed 5/4/06) 
§ 150.352 - Acceptance test procedures. 
(A)  Acceptance testing for an in-building/structure radio amplification system is required, upon completion of the installation of the radio amplification system. It is the building owner's responsibility to have the radio amplification system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of DAQ3. 
(B)  Each floor of the building/structure shall be divided into a grid of approximately 40 equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor may be divided into 80 equal areas. In such event, a maximum of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. If the radio amplification system continues to fail the test after eight testing attempts, the building/structure owner shall repair, replace, alter or upgrade the radio amplification system to meet the DAQ3 coverage requirement. Talk back testing from the site to the village's E911 PSAP Communications Center shall use a four watt UHF portable transceiver with public safety speaker/microphone and flexible antenna attached, and a five watt VHF transceiver with speaker/microphone and flexible antenna. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building/structure. Once the spot as been selected, use of another spot within the grid area will not be permitted. Field strength testing instruments are to be recently calibrated (within the past 12 months) and of the frequency selective type incorporating a flexible antenna similar to the ones used on the hand held transceivers. 
(C)  The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the building/structure owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurements results become lost, the building/structure owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
(Ord. 5847, passed 5/4/06) 
§ 150.353 - Annual test. 
    When an in-building/structure radio amplification system is installed, the building/structure owner shall test all active components of the radio amplification system including, but not limited to the amplifier, the power supplies and the back-up batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance of the radio amplification system. Back-up batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will operate during an actual power outage. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturer's specification for the intended purpose. 
(Ord. 5847, passed 5/4/06) 
§ 150.354 - Owner responsibility for compliance. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any existing building or structure to cause said building or structure to come into compliance with the provisions of §§ 150.350-150.361 of this Code and to be maintained thereafter in full compliance therewith. All existing buildings or structures shall comply with §§ 150.350-150.361 of this Code within one year after being notified by the village to do so. An extension of one additional year may be granted by the Fire Chief with an approved phase in plan.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

§ 151.01 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to diminish threats to public health, safety, and welfare caused by increases in stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment. Excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties, erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, threat to public health and safety, and pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. Increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality are caused by development and land improvement and, as such, this Chapter regulates these activities to prevent stormwater adverse impacts caused by new development and redevelopment. 
    This Chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
(A)  Prevent flood and drainage hazards resulting from new development or redevelopment; 
(B)  Prevent the creation of unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(C)  Protect new buildings and major improvements from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff; 
(D)  Protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
(E)  Lessen the burden on taxpayers for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
(F)  Protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(G)  Protect the hydrologic, hydraulic, and other beneficial functions of streams, lakes, wetlands, floodplains, and flood-prone areas; 
(H)  Preserve stream corridors to moderate flooding and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits, and enhance community and economic development; 
(I)  Prevent additional disruption of governmental services and the economy due to flooding and drainage problems; and 
(J)  Establish requirements for, and promote regular, planned maintenance of, stormwater management facilities. 
(Ord. No. 7502, § 1, passed 4-5-18) 
§ 151.02 - Application of other regulations. 
    Before starting any of the work regulated by this Chapter, an applicant shall comply with the requirements set forth in other applicable provisions of this code with respect to submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement plans, building permits, inspections, certificates of occupancy, zoning certificates, appeals and similar matters, along with those set forth in this Chapter and as may be required by Federal, State (or any department or agency thereof), or DuPage County laws and/or regulations.

§ 151.04 - Amendments to the DuPage County Ordinance. 
(A)  Section 15-72.A of the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater and Floodplain Ordinance is hereby revised to read in its entirety as follows: 
    15-72.A All new development that increases the total impervious area (TIA), of the development property by more than 5,000 square feet, after July 1, 2012, shall require surface water runoff from the limits of said lot to be limited by detention or retention to the maximum of 0.10 cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre of land or fraction thereof for the one percent annual recurrence (100-year) rainfall event, unless: 
i.  the net TIA without detention will be within 5,000 square feet of the TIA that existed on February 15, 1992; 
ii.  the TIA will decrease by at least five percent from its highest level in the past three years; or 
iii.  the TIA will be less than ten percent of the entire development property area. 
(A)  All surface water detention/retention or equivalent shall be in excess of the allocation provided for an equivalency of flood plain, which may involve a subject tract or portion thereof. 
(B)  Any improvements which are necessary to comply with this section shall be proposed by the owner or developer in preliminary form to the Director of Community Development. The Director of Community Development shall have the authority to review and approve or disapprove said improvements based on whether or not they meet the terms of this section. The owner or developer shall take into account with the submittal of the plans, the effect of the improvement of any land or land tract to downstream and surrounding areas as a result of rainfall and surface water runoff. 
(C)  The Director of Community Development shall notify adjacent communities and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources, and the Federal Insurance Administration prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. The flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. 
(D)  (1)  No building permit shall be issued for any property which is being built or substantially improved in accordance with this Chapter or Chapter 154 of this Code, until stormwater detention or retention improvements have been completed or installed so that they are operational. Installation and operational does not necessarily mean all final grading has been approved, constructed and accepted, but that the system substantially functions the way it was designed. 
(2)  In the event stormwater detention or retention is not immediately necessary because the earth work or construction on the site will not have an adverse effect on stormwater control, sedimentation, or erosion on any adjacent or nearby properties, building permits may be issued at the direction of the Director of Community Development or his/her designee. The Director of Community Development may direct and require, as a condition of the issuance of the building permit, construction of stormwater improvements within a designated time or on any schedule he/she deems reasonably necessary to protect adjacent or surrounding properties. 
(3)  If stormwater detention or retention improvements are to be constructed using hard surface or any item involving a building permit, a building permit may be issued at the direction of the Director of Community Development or his/her designee with any terms, conditions, or timing requirements deemed necessary by the Director of Community Development or his/her designee to adequately protect adjacent or surrounding properties. 
(4)  During all construction phases until final occupancy, the stormwater detention shall be substantially functional in the way it was designed and approved by the village.

(B)  The DuPage County Ordinance is hereby amended to add the following: 
    15-72.H Single Family Residential Development: Any single family residential development that shall increase the impervious areas on a lot by more than 500 square feet, cumulatively, for development occurring on or after September 1, 2001, and that is not part of a major subdivision with a stormwater detention/retention facility as required per the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater and Floodplain Ordinance or the amendments listed above, shall include one percent minimum slope swales along the entire length of the rear and side property lines, if physically possible. If there is less than a continuous one percent minimum slope from the new impervious areas to a storm sewer or defined watercourse, then drain tiles, storm drains and/or dry wells shall be required to convey or store the 100-year runoff. Such drainage improvements shall be as directed to the Director of Community Development based on technical feasibility, impact on other properties, available easements and cost. Whenever possible, such direction shall be based on site inspections rather than a topographic survey. Drain tiles and/or storm drains shall drain from flat or low areas into a separated storm sewer or to a swale or ditch having a continuous one percent minimum slope to a separated storm sewer or defined watercourse. The preferred location for storm drain inlets shall be a rear corner of the lot. Dry wells shall be located and sized to contain volume equal to the new impervious area times 0.58 foot of runoff. Dry wells shall not be located in utility easements or public rights-of-way. The existing impervious area shall be subtracted from proposed impervious area to determine the increase in impervious area.

(Ord. No. 7502, § 1, passed 4-5-18) 
§ 151.09 - Variance procedure. 
(A)  In the event the owner or developer of the property is unable to meet the requirements of the regulations of this Chapter which are more restrictive than the DuPage County Ordinance and seeks a variance, the variance may only be considered in the following situations: 
(1)  Detention or retention is to be provided off site, but in a manner which is satisfactory or acceptable to the village; or 
(2)  The property to be developed cannot adequately provide on-site water detention, but the village deems it necessary or beneficial to develop said property with the detention/retention to be met in some other fashion than on-site detention. 
(B)  A fee of $425.00 shall be charged to process any variance request. Said fee is to cover the costs of the hearing and engineering work. Any variance request requiring detailed engineering review shall be charged an additional $500.00 fee. 
(C)  The variance may be approved to the Village Board of Trustees following receipt of a recommendation from the Public Works and Environmental Concerns Committee (for public property) or Board of Building Appeals (for private property).

Such an administrative variance shall not require a public hearing or approval by the Village Board of Trustees. Where an administrative variance is granted, fees as required by 151.04 (L) above, as well as a $200.00 administrative processing fee, shall be deposited into the detention fund for the appropriate watershed. 
(1)  In cases where such an administrative variance is requested, the petition for said variation submit evidence, in writing, that: 
(a)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be applied; 
(b)  The conditions upon which the variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not generally applicable to other properties in the neighborhood; 
(c)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
(d)  The variation, if granted, will not impair natural drainage or create drainage problems on adjacent or downstream properties, or endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(H)  Appeals relative to an administrative variance that is denied, will follow the process for a variance under subsections (C) through (F) above, including any fees due. 
(I)  Revocation. Where a variation has been granted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, such approval shall become null and void unless work is completed by December 31 of the third year from the date of stormwater certification or permit issuance, whichever is earlier.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING SIGNS 

§ 153.301 - Statement of purpose. 
    This Chapter recognizes the establishment of separate zoning districts by the zoning ordinance, and details the appropriate signage for that district. Signs existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, codified in this Chapter, and not conforming to its provisions, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signage established illegally shall be removed immediately and shall be subject to the police power of the Village of Lombard. Legally established nonconforming signs shall be subject to the provisions of this section, as set forth below. 
The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming signage and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming signage shall be permitted to continue. 
§ 153.302 - Nonconforming signage. 
    A sign located upon a parcel of property, which is not authorized in the list of permitted signage for the zoning district in which the parcel is located shall be subject to the provisions of Subsection B, below. 
(A)  Authority to continue. Any lawfully nonconforming sign or part of a sign may remain in use, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, for a period of time specified in subsection (G) "sign amortization schedule" hereunder. During this period of time the face of the sign may be replaced subject to the limitation of subsection (C) hereunder. At the end of the prescribed period of time, the legal nonconforming status of the sign shall expire and the sign shall be removed. The existence of a nonconforming sign on a parcel of property shall not be construed to allow the establishment of other legal, nonconforming signs on the parcel. 
(B)  Repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or changing of parts designed for changes which do not require any permit shall not be considered an alteration; and shall be permitted, provided however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsection (C) through (F) hereunder. 
(C)  Expansion. A legal nonconforming sign shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in size or intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited to: 
(1)  Expansion of the surface area, by increasing height or width beyond the dimensions of the sign at the time such sign became a legal, nonconforming. 
(2)  Expansion of the illumination of a sign, by the addition of lighting or increasing the intensity of existing lighting beyond the level of illumination existing at the time such sign became a legal, nonconforming sign. 
(3)  Expansion of useful life, by structurally altering the nonconforming signs so as to prolong the life of the sign beyond that which would have existed at the time such sign became a legal, nonconforming sign. 
(D)  Relocation. Legal, nonconforming signs shall be allowed to be relocated wholly to any other location on the same lot, provided the new sign location meets the applicable setbacks and clear line of sight provisions. Structural elements are not allowed to be changed, as the life of the sign cannot be extended. 
(E)  Abandonment or discontinuance. The continued use of a legal nonconforming sign shall terminate upon the existence of any one of the following conditions. Any subsequent signage shall comply with the regulations for the district in which the sign is located. 
(1)  When the use of a legal, nonconforming sign is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 90 consecutive days (regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon and to resume such use), such sign shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed. 
(2)  When the enterprise or business establishment, advertised or identified by a legal nonconforming sign, is terminated or relocated, such sign shall be deemed to be abandoned and said sign shall be removed from the premises. 
(F)  Damage or destruction. In the event that any sign in whole or in part is a legal, nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such sign immediately prior to such damage, such sign shall not be restored unless such sign shall thereafter conform to all regulations for the district in which such sign is located. When such damage or destruction is 50 percent or less of the fair market value of such sign immediately prior to such damage, such sign may be repaired and reconstructed and returned to the same condition and use as existed prior to the damage or destruction, provided such repairs or reconstruction is commenced and completed within 90 days of the date of damage or destruction. The fair market value shall be determined by the Director of Community Development, based on an appraisal conducted by an independent sign contractor. 
(G)  Sign amortization schedule. Any sign lawfully existing or under construction on the effective date of this § 153.302 which does not conform to the provisions of Chapter 153 of the Village Code; shall be removed or made to conform within seven years of the date of notification by the village that the sign no longer conforms with the requirements of Chapter 153 of the Village Code. Any sign lawfully existing or under construction on the effective date of this § 153.302 which does not conform to the provisions of Chapter 153 of the Village Code may request a variation as outlined in subsection 153.103(I) of this Code. 
(H)  Notification requirement. It shall be the duty of the Owner or Lessor of any property on which a legal nonconforming sign is located to represent, in writing, to a buyer or tenant the number of years remaining on the amortization schedule for any sign on said property which is subject to the provisions of this section. Failure or the Owner or Lessor to provide such information in writing as part of the lease or contract for sale shall be considered a violation of this section.

The total sign surface area of a single awning or canopy sign shall not exceed 200 square feet. 
(iii)  If the awning or canopy sign is to be set back a minimum of 240 feet from the property line which the sign shall face, then the total sign surface area of all awning, canopy or wall signs on the single parcel of property shall not exceed two times the lineal front footage of the property.

    Procedures governing all plats of subdivision (any reference to plat of subdivision also includes plat of resubdivision), plats of consolidation, plats of dedication, site plan review, appeals, variations, plats of vacation, amendments and related procedures, shall be as described below. 
In preparing any plat, site plan, or related document, the petitioner should consult the terms of this Chapter and the Village of Lombard's comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, and code of ordinances to ensure conformity with intent and compliance with all regulatory requirements. Questions regarding these documents or any requirements therein should be directed to the Department of Community Development. It is the intent of this Chapter that any application for change in zoning or other land use control of the site be reviewed simultaneously with the Plat of Subdivision. Failure to supply the required information or consult with the Department of Community Development may result in unnecessary delays. 
(A)  General procedures for plats of subdivision. 
(1)  Initiation of a plat. Any owner of property, or an authorized representative, may request approval of a plat of subdivision. 
(2)  Filing for a plat of subdivision. An application for a plat of subdivision shall be filed with the Director of Community Development in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the Director of Community Development. 
(3)  Authority. The authority to approve a plat of subdivision shall rest with the Director of Community Development in the case of administrative plats and the Board of Trustees in the case of minor and major plats of subdivision. 
(4)  Approval of plats. No Plat shall be approved unless it has been determined by the appropriate village authority that the proposed Plat of Subdivision complies with all the terms, standards, and regulations of this Chapter. 
(5)  Surveyor's signature required on plats and copies. All original plats submitted for recording and all copies of plats submitted for staff, Plan Commission and Board of Trustees review shall be signed and sealed by an Illinois Registered Land Surveyor. Plats, or copies of Plats, submitted without a Surveyor's signature and seal, shall not be considered for approval until said signature and seal are provided. 
(B)  Preliminary plats of subdivision. 
(1)  Initiation. An applicant may choose to submit a preliminary plat of subdivision for approval prior to submittal of the final plat of subdivision. The Director of Community Development should be consulted to determine the appropriateness of a preliminary plat. 
(2)  Purpose of preliminary plats. The purpose of a preliminary plat review process is to allow an applicant to determine the appropriateness of a proposed, conceptual subdivision design. This shall generally mean the configuration of streets and lots; conceptual landscaping design; and conceptual engineering plans. 
(3)  Submittal requirements. The primary difference between a preliminary and final plat is the submittal requirements. The submittal requirements for a preliminary plat shall be as established by the Director of Community Development; but generally, a preliminary plat may be accompanied by conceptual engineering, site, and landscape plans. Whereas, a final plat must be accompanied by final plans. 
(4)  Submittal of final plats after preliminary approval. Preliminary plat approval shall be null and void unless a final plat of subdivision is submitted within one year of the Board of Trustees approval of the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Procedures for preliminary plats and final plats. Procedures for a preliminary Plat generally shall be the same as those for the corresponding final Plat as described in subsections (C)(3) and (C)(4), below. However, a final plat that has received preliminary approval from the Board of Trustees does not require final plat approval from the Plan Commission. Such plats shall be sent directly to the Board of Trustees upon conclusion of staff review. 
(C)  Procedures for administrative plats of subdivision. An administrative plat is the division of a lot or block of less than one acre in any recorded subdivision into four or less lots, or the consolidation of lots of any size into a single lot of record, which subdivision or consolidation does not involve any new streets, extensions of existing streets, or easements of access, and complies with all provisions of this and all other applicable. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing in light of § 155.306 of this Code, an administrative plat may involve a lot in an R-1 or R-2 Single Family Residence District, which has been developed with a dwelling and does not meet the minimum lot size and/or lot width requirements, provided the lot size and lot width of the lot in question equals at least 80 percent of that required by § 155.305 or § 155.406 of this Code, whichever is applicable, and further provided that the lot, and the location of the dwelling and accessory structures thereon, if any, otherwise complies with the provisions of Chapters 154 and 155 of this Code. 
(1)  Pre-application meeting. Although this first step is optional, it is highly recommended that the subdivider schedule a meeting with the Department of Community Development and other appropriate staff to discuss the feasibility of the proposal and review village requirements and procedures. Depending upon the plat and the type of development proposal, the subdivider may meet with village staff on more than one occasion. The subdivider may submit a conceptual or sketch plan asking to comment on it before a formal submission is made. While requiring additional time and effort before the start of the process, this ultimately works to the advantage of both the village and the subdivider by serving to identify the major flaws or deficiencies of the proposal at an early stage while the project design is still relatively flexible; and, thus, eliminates potential time delays as the proposal works its way through the review and approval process. 
(2)  Submittal of application for plat approval. Submittal of the application for plat approval formally begins the village's development review process. The application consists of the completion and submittal of the application form provided by the Department of Community Development, submittal of the final plat of subdivision, payment of the required fees, payment of any applicable engineering fees, and any required supporting materials specified in the aforementioned application or requested by the Director of Community Development. 
(3)  Staff review of the administrative plat. Upon receipt of the application for final plat of subdivision and all necessary supporting documents as required, the proposal will be reviewed by the village's Interdepartmental Review Committee. The subdivider will be contacted by the Department of Community Development and informed of the Committee's findings. This may result in revisions or refinements to the proposed plat of subdivision. A final plat of subdivision must be submitted within 45 calendar days of written notification of the Committee's findings, or the plat approval will be null and void. 
(4)  Final approval. Upon the conclusion of its review and receipt of the final plat, the Director of Community Development shall grant or deny the plat as determined appropriate. Approval shall be so designated by the Director's signature on the final plat of subdivision. If denied, the Director shall inform the subdivider, in writing, of the denial, the reasons for the denial, and procedures for appealing the Director's decision. 
(5)  Appeal of administrative plat denial. Any aggrieved party may request Plan Commission review of the plat by filing a letter of appeal with the Department of Community Development and within 30 calendar days of the formal approval or denial of the plat of subdivision. Upon receipt of the letter of appeal and payment of any additional fees required, the Director of Community Development shall schedule the plat for review by the Plan Commission. The plat shall then comply with all procedures and requirements stipulated in subsection 154.203(D), below. 
(6)  Recording of final plat. Prior to the recording of a final plat, the Village Finance Director must certify that there are no delinquent or unpaid current of forfeited special assessments or any deferred installments apportioned against any portion of the property included in the plat. Following such certification the Director of Community Development will have the plat recorded in the office of the Recorder of DuPage County, Illinois. The original (vellum) of the recorded plat will be maintained on file at the Department of Community Development for purview by the public. A copy of the approved and recorded final plat of subdivision will be returned to the subdivider. 
(D)  Minor and major plats of subdivision. A minor plat consists of a lot or block of less than one acre that does not meet the criteria of an administrative plat but which does not include any new streets, extensions of existing streets, or easements of access and which consists of the division of land into four or less lots. A major plat consists of any subdivision which does not meet the criteria of an administrative plat and includes new streets, extensions of streets, or easements of access. The procedures for review of major and minor plats shall be as described below. 
(1)  Pre-application meeting. It is recommended that prior to the filing of an application for approval of a plat of subdivision, the subdivider schedule a meeting with the Department of Community Development and other appropriate village staff to discuss the feasibility of the proposal and become familiar with the village requirements and procedures. Depending upon the application and the type of development proposed, the subdivider may meet with the village staff on more than one occasion. The subdivider should submit a conceptual or "sketch" plan for staff comment prior to a formal submittal. The pre-application meeting is intended, in part, to provide for the clarification of interpretations, avoidance of misunderstandings, and development of liaison in order to expedite the development of land while minimizing the expenditure of time and financial resources of the applicant and the village, as the proposal works its way through the review and approval process. 
(2)  Submittal of application for plat of subdivision. Submittal of the application formally begins the village's plat review process. The application consists of the following documents: 
(a)  Application for plat of subdivision; 
(b)  Required fees including the plat review fee, engineering services fees, and any other fees established by village ordinances; 
(c)  Engineering plans: Final engineering plans required for final plats, conceptual engineering plans required for preliminary plats; 
(d)  Copies of the final or preliminary plat of subdivision; 
(e)  Subdivision and development agreement (see Article VI of this Chapter); 
(f)  Any other supporting materials as specified in the aforementioned application or as may be requested by the Director of Community Development. 
(3)  Staff review-Preliminary plat. Upon receipt of the application for preliminary approval of a plat of subdivision and all necessary supporting materials, the proposal will be reviewed by the Village Interdepartmental Review Committee. The subdivider will be contacted by the Department of Community Development and will be informed of the Committee's comments. This may result in minor revisions or refinements to the proposed plan. Upon receipt of the revised plans, the Department of Community Development will then prepare an Interdepartmental Report summarizing the development proposal and any unresolved staff comments. The report will then be distributed to the subdivider, the Plan Commission, and made available to the general public. 
(4)  Staff review-Final plat. If a final Plat of Subdivision is submitted without prior approval of a preliminary plat, procedures for staff review of the final plat shall be the same as a preliminary plat. If preliminary plat approval was previously granted by the Board of Trustees, the final plat may proceed directly to the Board of Trustees upon conclusion of the staff review and without further review by the Plan Commission. However, no final plat shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees until such time that the Department of Community Development has determined that the plat, site plan, landscaping plan, and engineering plans comply with the relevant ordinances of the Village of Lombard. 
(5)  Plan commission recommendation. At a regularly scheduled meeting, the Plan Commission shall conduct a public review of the preliminary or final plat (a final plat that has received preliminary approval from the Board of Trustees shall proceed directly to the Board upon conclusion of staff review without further review by the Plan Commission). All persons desiring to express an opinion regarding the plat shall be given an opportunity to be heard at the Plan Commission meeting. The Plan Commission shall submit findings and a recommendation to the Board of Trustees to grant, deny, wholly or in part, or require modification of the application as deemed appropriate. The Plan Commission may include conditions in its recommendation to ensure conformity with the comprehensive plan, established village policies, and applicable village ordinances. Prior to Board review, the subdivider should revise the petition to reflect any Plan Commission condition(s), as appropriate. 
(6)  Village Board of Trustees action. Upon receipt of the Plan Commission findings and recommendation or upon receipt of the final plat from the Department of Community Development, the Village Board, upon the majority vote of the members present, shall grant, deny, wholly, or in part, or require modifications of the plat as it determines appropriate. No new or additional evidence or testimony will be accepted at this time. The Village Board may require such special conditions in the approval of a petition as it may deem necessary to ensure conformity with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, established village policies, and applicable village codes and ordinances. Upon Village Board approval of the plat, the Village President and Village Clerk will sign the Final Plat of Subdivision indicating that it has been approved by the Village of Lombard. 
(7)  Recording of final plat. The original final plat must be submitted to the Department of Community Development within one year from the date of approval by the Board of Trustees unless otherwise specified by the Board. Prior to the recording of the final plat, the Village Finance Director must certify that no delinquent or unpaid current or forfeited special assessments or any deferred installments apportioned against any portion of the property included in the plat exist. Following such certification, the Director of Community Development will have the plat recorded in the office of the Recorder of DuPage County, Illinois. The original (vellum) of the recorded plat will be maintained on file at the Department of Community Development for purview by the public. A copy of the approved and recorded Final Plat of Subdivision will be returned to the subdivider. 
(E)  Variations. 
(1)  Initiation. An application for a variation of the terms of this Chapter may be made by any person, firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board, bureau or commission requesting or intending to request an application for a plat or a building permit. 
(2)  Authority. Any request for variation of this Chapter which is accompanied (referred to as a companion variation) by an application for a plat or a request for some type of review pursuant to the zoning ordinance (rezoning, annexation, conditional use, plat of subdivision, etc.) shall be submitted to the Plan Commission for a public hearing. The Plan Commission shall conduct a review and make a recommendation in conjunction with the accompanying request. In the event a variation is requested without any concurrent action requiring a Plan Commission review or recommendation, the variation shall be immediately and directly forwarded to the Board of Trustees for a public hearing. 
(3)  Public notice. Notice of all public hearings for a variation of this Chapter, whether conducted by the Plan Commission or Board of Trustees, shall be published not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before said hearing in one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the Village of Lombard. 
(4)  Standards for variations. Where the Plan Commission finds that extraordinary hardship or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may recommend to the Village Board of Trustees the approval of variations to the regulations of this Chapter so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided that the Plan Commission shall not recommend variations to the provisions of these regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(a)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located. 
(b)  The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not applicable, generally, to other property. 
(c)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out; and, 
(d)  Such variation or exception will not conflict with provisions of the Lombard Zoning Ordinance or Comprehensive Plan. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of Planned Developments when the Plan Commission finds that a plan and program for a new neighborhood unit or part thereof provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and public utilities service needs of the tract when fully developed, and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity and achievement of the plan. 
(5)  Conditions. In reviewing variations, the Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations. 
(6)  Procedure for a variation. A petition for any such variation shall be submitted in writing by the developer at the time the application for plat of subdivision, or other requests are filed for consideration of the Plan Commission. In the event no Plan Commission action is requested, the submission of a variation shall be made to the Board of Trustees through the Director of Community Development. The petitioner shall state fully the grounds for the petition and all facts relied upon by the petitioner. 
(7)  Standards for variation by the board of trustees. In the event no recommendation for a variation is necessary or required of the Plan Commission, and the Village Board of Trustees hears the request for a variation, the grounds of granting a variation shall be the same as contained in subsection 154.203(E)(4), above. 
(8)  Approval. After recommendation of the Plan Commission, and/or hearing by the Board of Trustees, the Village Board may approve such variations from the requirements of this Chapter which in their opinion do not adversely affect the current Comprehensive Plan or the intent and purpose of these regulations. 
(F)  Plats of vacation (public rights-of-way). 
(1)  Initiation. A plat of vacation may be requested by the owner(s) of property (or a duly authorized representative) adjacent to any right-of-way included in the proposed vacation. 
(2)  Filing for a plat of vacation. An application for a plat of vacation shall be filed with the Director of Community Development in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the Director of Community Development. 
(3)  Review by the Interdepartmental Review Committee. Upon receipt of a request for a plat of vacation, the Director of Community Development shall request review of the plat by the Interdepartmental Review Committee. The Director shall then provide a report to the applicant indicating the conclusions of the Interdepartmental Review Committee. 
(4)  Appraisal of right-of-way. If the applicant wishes to proceed after the conclusion of the review by the Interdepartmental Review Committee, the Director of Community Development shall proceed with a real estate appraisal of the right-of-way to be vacated. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with the real estate appraisal. 
(5)  Board of Trustees action. The Director of Community Development shall submit the Interdepartmental Review Committee report and the results of the real estate appraisal to the Board of Trustees. After review and due consideration, the Board shall act on said plat of vacation. 
(6)  Standards for plats of vacation. The Board of Trustees shall not approve a plat of vacation unless findings based on the evidence presented are made in each specific case that affirm each of the following standards: 
(a)  That the vacation of the right-of-way shall not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or general welfare; 
(b)  That the right-of-way to be vacated does not have some significant present or future public benefit in terms of serving the transportation needs of the village; 
(c)  That adequate compensation is provided to the village for the loss of public lands; 
(7)  Exceptions for single-family residential areas. The Board of Trustees shall have the authority and the sole discretion to waive the above requirements for application fees, real estate appraisals, and compensation for the vacation of rights-of-way bounded by single-family residences. 
(8)  Conformance to Illinois Compiled Statutes. All Plats of Vacation and ownership of vacated rights-of-way shall conform to 65 ILCS 5/11-91. 
(G)  Plats of dedication. When a final plat of subdivision has been approved by the Village Board of Trustees and all other required approvals are obtained and the plat is recorded, that approval shall constitute acceptance for the purpose designated on the Plat of all lands shown on the plat as dedicated to the public, including street rights-of-way. 
Whenever a petition includes a proposed dedication of land to public use and the Plan Commission finds that such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the Plan Commission may recommend that the Village Board either refuse to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of lots in the proposed subdivision to include such land. 
(H)  Vacation of a plat of subdivision. 
(1)  Any plat or any part of a plat of subdivision may be vacated by the owner of the premises at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same to be vacated. 
(2)  Such an instrument shall be approved by the Plan Commission and Village Board in like manner as other plats of subdivisions. The Village Board may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public right in any of its streets or alleys. Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and recorded or filed in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly recorded or filed, shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat. 
(3)  When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided by all the owners of lots in such Plat joining in the execution of such writing. 
(I)  Amendments. For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare, the Village Board may from time to time amend the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations. All such amendments shall comply with the following procedures. 
(1)  Initiation. Amendments may be proposed by the Village Board, Plan Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, Department of Community Development, other village officials or any interested person or organization. 
(2)  Filing an amendment. An application for an amendment to this Chapter shall be filed with the Director of Community Development in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the Director of Community Development. 
(3)  Public meetings. Public meetings on all proposed amendments pursuant to normal village procedure shall be followed. In the event any proposed amendment would have some significant impact on the Plan Commission, the Board of Trustees may refer the proposed amendments to the Plan Commission for public hearings in the manner prescribed by law. The Plan Commission, after hearing the matter, shall make its recommendations to the Board of Trustees. 
(4)  Action by the Board of Trustees. The Village Board shall have the sole authority to approve or deny all requests for amendments to this Chapter. 
(J)  Appeals. Any person, firm or corporation aggrieved by a failure of the Village Board to approve a final plat of subdivision may appeal therefrom to any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(K)  Pre-ordinance subdivisions. Where a previously approved subdivision and/or proposed development is not in complete compliance with the requirements of this Chapter, the owner of such subdivision may apply to the Plan Commission for a variation to allow design and/or construction features which, though contrary to these regulations, were officially approved by the Village Board. In such case, the Plan Commission shall review the Plat, conduct a public hearing, and recommend approval or disapproval to the Village Board. Final disposition of the requested variation shall be determined by the Village Board. 
(L)  Fees. 
(1)  Application review fees. In order to cover the costs of plan examination, filing, publication, recording and other expenses incidental to the approval of a plat of subdivision or other administrative procedure of this Chapter, the applicant shall pay a fee at the time of application for the administrative procedure. There shall be no refund of any portion of the fee if the petitioner fails to apply for final approval of the subdivision or withdrawals the application at any time. 
(2)  Engineering review fees. In addition to the application review fee, an engineering review fee shall be levied against all subdivisions and developments to cover engineering plan review and construction inspection. The applicant shall deposit with the village a fee based upon established percentage of cost of completion of all public improvements.

The proceeds of the instrument of credit shall be utilized to pay for all costs and expenses including legal fees and administrative expenses, resulting from or incurred as a result of the developer's failure or refusal to complete the public improvements and fully meet its obligations under this Code. If the funds remaining in the instrument of credit are insufficient to cover all such costs and expenses and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required instrument of credit during the entire time such instrument of credit should have been maintained by the developer, then the developer shall, upon demand of the Director, immediately deposit with the Director such additional funds as the Director determines are necessary to fully cover such costs and expenses and to establish such cash reserve. 
(E)  Extension of letter of credit. The Director of Community Development, upon written proof of difficulty, shall have the authority to grant one extension of the instrument of credit, not to exceed six months. The Village Board may, upon written proof of difficulty, grant additional extensions of the instrument of credit.

§ 155.001 - Title. 
    This Chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the "Lombard Zoning Ordinance". 
§ 155.002 - Purpose and intent. 
    The Lombard Zoning Ordinance is adopted for the purpose of protecting and promoting the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the people. The fulfillment of this purpose is to be accomplished by seeking: 
(A)  To zone all properties with a view to conserving the value of buildings and land and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the village. 
(B)  To protect residential, business, commercial and industrial areas from encroachment by incompatible uses and to ensure that land allocated to a class of uses shall not be usurped by other inappropriate uses. 
(C)  To avoid the inappropriate development of lands and to provide for adequate drainage, curbing of erosion, and reduction of flood damage. 
(D)  To establish reasonable and safe standards to which buildings and structures shall conform. 
(E)  To establish adequate standards for the provision of light, air, safety, and open space. 
(F)  To define the powers and duties of the administrative and enforcement officers and bodies. 
(G)  To promote the recognition of aesthetics as a value and a standard throughout the village and to protect and enhance the environments. 
(H)  To facilitate the provision of adequate transportation, and to provide public necessities such as water, sewers, streets, and parks. 
(I)  To prevent the overcrowding of land, thereby ensuring proper living and working conditions, and the prevention of blight and slums. 
(J)  To provide for the regulation of nonconforming land use and buildings, and the gradual elimination thereof. 
(K)  To provide a more rational pattern of relationship between residential, business, commercial, and manufacturing uses for the mutual benefit of all residents. 
(L)  To eliminate, isolate, or control the location of unavoidable nuisance producing uses. 
(M)  To prevent such additions to, and alterations or remodeling of existing buildings or structures that would not comply with the restrictions and limitations required herein. 
(N)  To promote the development of property in a manner which is compatible with the objectives enumerated herein, and in a manner which will benefit the Village of Lombard, its residents, and the municipal government. 
(O)  To encourage a beneficial arrangement of structures, landscaping, streets, roads, or walkways on each zoning lot or within each development located within the village. 
(P)  To designate penalties for any violation of the requirements of this ordinance and to provide a basis for appropriate enforcement. 
The standards and requirements contained in this Chapter, and the district mapping reflected on the Lombard Zoning Map, are intended to further the implementation of the objectives of the official comprehensive plan, as well as protect all desirable existing structures and uses.

(8)  Standards. The regulations of this Chapter shall not be amended unless findings based on the evidence presented are made in each specific case that affirm each of the following standards: 
(a)  Map amendments. Where a map amendment is proposed, the Plan Commission shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with respect to, but not limited to, the following matters: 
(i)  Compatibility with existing uses of property within the general area of the property in question;

The repeal of a map amendment can then be effected by the adoption of an ordinance repealing the amendment by the Board of Trustees. 
(F)  Conditional uses. 
(1)  Intent and applicability. The development and execution of this Chapter is based upon the division of the community into districts within which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Such conditional uses fall into two categories: 
(a)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest. 
(b)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(2)  Authority. The Board of Trustees shall render final decisions on all applications for a conditional use. The Plan Commission shall hold a public hearing, prepare findings of fact, and submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees for their consideration. 
(3)  Eligible petitioners. Any person, firm, corporation, office, department, or other legal entity having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable, may file an application with the written consent of the property owner, to use such land for one or more of the conditional uses provided for in this ordinance in the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(4)  Filing for application. An application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Director of Community Development or an official, prescribed form. The application shall be accompanied by the following plans, data or information: 
(a)  A statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set forth in subsection (F), hereinafter. 
(b)  The existing use and zoning of land within 200 feet of the subject site. 
(c)  An accurate legal description of the subject property. 
(d)  Other information as may be required at the discretion of the Director of Community Development. 
Such application shall be forwarded from the Director of Community Development to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation to the Village Board. 
(5)  Public hearings. Public hearings conforming to state statute and conforming with subsection 155.103(J), below, shall be required for all conditional use applications. 
(6)  Plan commission action. For each application for a conditional use, the Plan Commission shall, within 30 days of the conclusion of the public hearing concerning such application, submit its written findings to the Village Board, including the stipulations of additional conditions, and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. 
(7)  Action by the Village Board. 
(a)  The Village Board shall not act upon a proposed conditional use permitted under this Chapter until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from the Plan Commission. 
(b)  The Village Board may grant by ordinance, deny, or refer back to the Plan Commission for further study, any application for conditional use, and may establish such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use, as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in section 155.103(F)(8), below. 
(c)  In all cases where the Village Board permits the establishment of a conditional use, the terms of the relief granted shall be specifically set forth in the ordinance. 
(8)  Standards. No conditional use shall be recommended by the Plan Commission unless it finds: 
(a)  That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare; 
(b)  That the conditional use will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood in which it is to be located. 
(c)  That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; 
(d)  That adequate public utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or will be provided; 
(e)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; 
(f)  That the proposed conditional use is not contrary to the objectives of the current comprehensive plan for the Village of Lombard; and 
(g)  That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified pursuant to the recommendations of the Plan Commission. 
(9)  Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the Plan Commission may recommend and the Village Board may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified above. In all cases in which conditional uses are granted, the Village Board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditional use complies with all conditions stipulated in connection therewith. 
(10)  Effect of denial of application. No application for a conditional use which has been denied wholly or in part by the Village Board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said denial, except on the grounds of new factual evidence, or a change in conditions which would alter the concept or intent of the request. Such changes may include more than a 15 percent modification in the density, height, land use, or building type, changes in road standards or alignment, or conditions which would have a positive effect on the surrounding property. New factual evidence or a change in conditions must be reviewed by the Director of Community Development. The Director of Community Development must find either new factual evidence or a change in conditions presented at the original public hearing, as well as a change in the site plan, before allowing a new public hearing to be conducted. 
(11)  Revocation. 
(a)  In any case where the construction of an approved conditional use is not substantially underway within one year from the date of granting thereof, and completed within 18 months thereof, then, without further action by the Village Board, the conditional use or authorization thereof shall be null and void. 
(b)  A conditional use permit may be revoked if conditional use as established or constructed on the site does not conform to the established conditions for approval. The Director of Community Development will be responsible for advising the Village Board of any violations and the Village Board may then authorize the Plan Commission to schedule a public hearing to consider revoking the conditional use permit. After conducting the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall then prepare a written report and recommendation to submit to the Village Board. Upon receipt of the Plan Commission's report, the Village Board shall then render a final judgment regarding rescinding the conditional use permit and accompanying ordinance. 
(12)  Expiration and transferability. A conditional use approval shall be deemed to authorize only a particular conditional use and shall expire if the conditional use shall cease for more than 12 months for any reason. However, the ownership of an authorized conditional use may be changed if the use remains unchanged. 
(13)  Modification or intensification. Any modification or intensification of a conditional use which alters the essential character or operation of the use in a way not intended at the time the conditional use was granted shall require a new conditional use permit. Such conditional use permit shall be applied for prior to any modification of the use or property. The Director of Community Development shall determine whether the proposed modification or intensification represents an alteration in the essential character of the original conditional use as approved. The operator of the conditional use shall provide the Director of Community Development with all the necessary information related to the conditional use to render this determination. 
(G)  Fees. Any person, firm corporation, or agent, who shall file an application for amendment or application for an appeal, variation, or conditional use, or for any other certificate, license, or procedure required under the terms of this ordinance, shall be charged a fee in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the Village of Lombard Board of Trustees. 
(H)  Penalties. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to occupy, or permit the occupancy any structure; engage in, maintain, or permit the maintenance of any business or enterprise; or in any other way use, or permit the use, of any parcel of property in other than full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
(2)  Any person, firm or corporation who violates, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined no more than $500.00 for each offense. Each day that the violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. 
(I)  Site plan review.

ARTICLE IV. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES 

§ 155.301 - Statement of purpose. 
    This Chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses which adversely affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in the district not be permitted to continue without restriction. Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses established illegally shall be removed or discontinued immediately and shall be subject to the police power of the Village of Lombard. Legally established nonconforming uses shall be subject to the provisions of this section, as set forth below. 
The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses shall be permitted to continue. 
§ 155.302 - Nonconforming uses. 
    A use located within a building or structure, or on open land, which is not authorized in the list of permitted uses in the zoning district in which such use is located shall be subject to the provisions of subsections 155.302(A)-(H), below. 
(A)  Authority to continue. Any lawfully nonconforming use of part or all of a building or structure, or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land not involving a building or structure or involving a building or structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of subsections 155.302(B)-(H) . The existence of a nonconforming use on part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract. 
(B)  Repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use, provided however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections 155.302(C)-(G) hereunder. 
(C)  Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited to: 
(1)  Expansion of such use to any building, structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use at the time such use became nonconforming. 
(2)  Expansion of such use within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use at the time such use became nonconforming. 
(3)  Operation of such nonconforming use in such a manner which conflicts with, or further conflicts with any requirement or standard established for the district in which such use is located. 
(D)  Relocation. No building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which such building or structure and use are located after being so relocated. No nonconforming use of land shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which such use of land is located after being so relocated. 
(E)  Change in use. A nonconforming use of land or of a building or structure shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which such land, building or structure is located. When such nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall only be used thereafter for a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. For the purpose of this subsection, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use shall have been terminated and the permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period of seven days. 
(F)  Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of part or all of a building or structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 365 consecutive days (regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon and to resume such use), such use shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed (unless a conditional use is granted as per § 155.305, below). Any subsequent use of such land, building or structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land, building or structure is located. 
(G)  Damage or destruction. In the event that any building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such building or structure immediately prior to such damage, such building or structure shall not be restored unless such building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which such building or structure and use are located. When such damage or destruction is 50 percent or less of the fair market value of the building or structure immediately prior to such damage, such building or structure may be repaired and reconstructed and used for the same purposes as it was before the damage or destruction, provided that such repair or damage or reconstruction is commenced and completed within 12 months of the date of damage or destruction. The fair market value shall be determined by the Director of Community Development based upon a real estate appraisal conducted by an independent and certified real estate appraiser. 
(H)  Increase in the intensity of a nonconforming use. No change in a nonconforming use pursuant to this subsection 155.302(E) shall be authorized which will increase either the number or intensity of uses on a parcel. 
§ 155.303 - Nonconforming buildings and structures. 
    Buildings and structures, within which principal uses take place, and which, due to the design or location on the lot, do not conform to the requirements of this ordinance for yards, lot area, lot width, maximum height, or any other provision of this Chapter shall be subject to the provisions established in subsections 155.303(A)-(D) below. 
(A)  Authority to continue. Any lawfully established nonconforming building or structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such building or structure is located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of subsections 155.303(C)-(D), below. 
(B)  Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming building, structure or other site feature may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building or structure. 
(C)  Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such building or structure immediately prior to such damage, such building or structure shall not be restored unless such building or structure shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which such building or structure and use are located. 
When such nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, by 50 percent or less of the fair market value of the building or structure immediately prior to such damage, such building or structure may be repaired and reconstructed, provided that such repair or restoration begin and is diligently pursued to completion within one year of the date of such damage. 
If the restoration is not started within one year of said calamity and diligently executed to completion, the building or structure shall be removed, and the area cleared by the owner, or at the owner's expense. 
(D)  Relocation. No nonconforming building or structure shall be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire building or structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which such building or structure is located after being relocated. 
§ 155.304 - Nonconforming accessory uses and structures. 
    No use, building or structure which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use, building or structure shall continue after such principal use, building or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless such accessory use, building or structure shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
§ 155.305 - Relief. 
    The owner of any building, structure or use which is subject to elimination under the terms of this Chapter may apply to the Plan Commission for a conditional use to allow such building, structure or use to continue or be re-established. Any legal nonconforming two-family dwelling that was lawfully established prior to January 1, 1960 and is located in the R2 Single-Family Residence District may apply to the Plan Commission for a conditional use to allow such use to continue or be re-established as a permitted legal nonconforming use prior to being subject to elimination under the terms of this Chapter. In such event, the procedures, terms, conditions, and standards for conditional uses set forth in subsection 155.103(F) of this Chapter shall be used to evaluate the application. 
(Ord. 6540; passed 10/21/10) 
§ 155.306 - Lot sizes-Reconstruction. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 155.301-155.305, of this Code, for an existing lot or parcel in an R0, R-1 or R-2 Single-Family Residence District, which has been developed with a dwelling and does not meet the minimum lot size and/or lot width requirements, where the village has issued a demolition permit to raise the existing dwelling or where the existing dwelling has been destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of the fair market value of dwelling, the owner will be allowed to rebuild the dwelling without need to appear before either the Plan Commission or the Zoning Board of Appeals, so long as all the requirements of Chapter 155 of this Code, other than lot size and lot width, are met relative to the proposed rebuilding of the dwelling. The provisions of this section shall only apply, however, provided: 
(A)  The owner of the lot or parcel in question submits a plat of subdivision or consolidation, and a request for approval of same, if said lot or parcel is not a single subdivided lot of record; and 
(B)  The lot size and lot width of the lot or parcel in question equals at least 80 percent of that required by § 155.305 or § 155.406, of this Code, whichever is applicable.

§ 155.417 - Roosevelt Road Corridor B4A District requirements. 
(A)  Purpose. The following regulations are hereby established to promote the health, safety, general welfare and the orderly growth and/or redevelopment of properties within the Roosevelt Road corridor; to achieve the goals and objectives of the Lombard Comprehensive Plan and any special planning efforts undertaken by the village. This B4A District is intended to provide for specific uses in a planned retail commercial setting that is compatible and complimentary with adjacent uses, including nearby residential neighborhoods that will promote a high level of architectural and landscaping excellence. The establishment of this district shall encourage appropriate design principles for buildings, site planning, landscaping and/or signage. It also sets forth preferred land uses and land use regulations that advance the comprehensive plan's overall recommendation of preserving the corridor as a viable retail commercial corridor. 
(B)  Applicability. The regulations for the Roosevelt Road Corridor B4A District shall apply to all properties within the district boundaries as depicted on the official zoning map. No land use or development within the Roosevelt Road Corridor B4A District boundaries, shall be commenced or approved except in conformance with the provisions of this section. 
(C)  Interpretation, scope of regulations. The regulations set forth by this Chapter shall be considered the minimum regulations and shall be uniformly applied, except as provided herein. For development activity occurring subsequent to the enactment of this section, no building structure or land shall be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all of the regulations herein. These regulations shall not apply to properties for which development approval has been obtained prior to the effective date of this ordinance. However, any future development activity not previously approved by the village prior to the adoption of this section shall be subject to the regulations set forth herein. 
(D)  Applicability. Because of the unique nature of the Corridor and that regional arterial corridors within Lombard have been identified as "areas of critical concern" due to heavy traffic movement, and because these corridors traditionally and functionally attract land uses of intense character, all development within this district shall, therefore, be subject to the site plan review provisions by the village's Inter-Departmental Review Committee (IDRC) as specified by subsection 155.103(I) of this Chapter. The IDRC and village staff shall provide guidance to the applicant to achieve the provisions set forth herein. 
(E)  Design guidelines, objectives and considerations. The IDRC shall review all applicable permits for new construction to determine compliance with the Chapter. The IDRC shall consider the following criteria in reviewing an application: 
(1)  Site design considerations: This section pertains to how the site design impacts adjacent residences and neighborhoods, special management areas, adjacent streets, pedestrian needs, and parking lot function and safety. 
(a)  Compatibility: The IDRC shall examine the functional relationship of the site to its surroundings, with special consideration of protecting adjacent residential neighborhoods. Particular attention should be given to the location of parking, driveways, outdoor lighting, outdoor use areas and compatibility of uses. Adjoining residential areas shall be protected by maintaining landscape buffers and providing decorative screening walls in locations where transitional setbacks cannot be provided. 
(b)  Traffic patterns: The IDRC shall evaluate vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic patterns. The development of land in cooperation with owners of adjoining properties is encouraged where parking, driveways, plazas and entries can be shared. Pedestrian and vehicular safety shall be maximized by properly locating and limiting the number of driveways as required by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and this Village Code. 
(c)  Off-street parking: The IDRC shall evaluate the arrangement and adequacy of off-street parking facilities and access points. Parking shall be safe, easily accessible and shall not be allowed to dominate the entire development. Plant materials shall accent and define entries. Large paved areas shall be scaled down by introducing different materials. Specialty materials such as tile and brick may be introduced where appropriate. 
(d)  Loading areas: The location, arrangement, and dimensions of loading ramps, docks and bays shall minimize visual and noise impacts on adjacent residential areas. 
(e)  The location of trash receptacles and screening of such undesirable elements such as loading areas, trash receptacles and mechanical equipment shall be screened. 
(f)  Exterior lighting and illumination upon neighboring properties shall meet the provisions included within subsection 155.602(A)(10)(d). 
(2)  Site landscaping and buffering: Site landscaping shall buffer unwanted views and sound, create an interesting streetscape, and provide a safe transition between contrasting uses. 
(a)  The location, height, and materials of walls, fences and screen plantings shall be reviewed. Selection of plant materials should be based on year-round interest, color, branching pattern, etc. Parking lots should be broken up with landscaped buffers to the greatest extent practical. The overall effect of both the perimeter landscaping and the interior landscaping should be one of a relatively consistent tree cover which will shade the pavement and vehicles. 
(b)  Ensure plans for the on-going landscaping maintenance are achievable. 
(c)  Open space should be located in a manner that maximizes its visual impact to adjacent rights of way and adjacent properties. 
(d)  Requisite transitional buffers shall be designed to minimize the impact of ambient noise and light spill on adjoining residential properties. 
(3)  Signage: Signage shall be designed in a manner that minimizes clutter and confusion and comply with provisions herein as well as within the Lombard Sign Ordinance (Chapter 153 of the Village Code). Signage plans for the entire site shall indicate how signs would be illuminated, their design and spatial relationship to other site amenities, including buildings. Signage, window designs and awnings are most effective when color coordinated with the building façade. 
(4)  Utilities: Utility systems shall not detract from the building or site appearance. The size and location of all service systems shall be appropriate and maintainable. Electrical and telephone service systems shall be buried unless it is not deemed to be practical, as determined by the associated utility company. 
(5)  Building design considerations: As part of the review process, the following elements shall be addressed: 
(a)  Building mass: The relationship to the surrounding uses shall be considered in respect to the scale and massing of the proposed uses. 
(b)  Exterior materials: Exterior materials and color shall reduce the apparent building mass and blend with the surrounding area. A variety of building colors to break up building mass is encouraged. Architectural elements such as overhangs, trellises, projections and awnings are encouraged to contribute to a building's character. 
(c)  Building elevations: Building elevation treatments shall be carried to all sides of the building to the greatest extent practical. Building construction and design shall be used to create a structure with substantially equal attractive sides of high quality, rather than placing emphasis on the front elevation of the structure and neglecting or downgrading the aesthetic appeal of the side and rear elevations. Corporate building designs shall be blended to fit within or enhance the Corridor. Roof materials and rooftop mechanical screening shall complement the primary building material and color. 
(d)  Accessory buildings: Accessory structures and/or additions shall utilize the same materials and design as the primary structure. 
(F)  Plan review procedures. As with all applications for major developments and planned development applications, a pre-application meeting is strongly encouraged for development activity within the B4A District prior to submittal of a building permit. The intent of the meeting is to identify project issues, clarify submittal requirements and review the development standards for the B4A District. 
Upon the completion of the Development Plan Review, applications for development within the B4A District that requires zoning relief shall be scheduled for action by the Plan Commission, the Zoning Board of Appeals and/or the Village Board, whichever is applicable, and upon submittal of an application for a public hearing. Should the proposal meet all provisions of this Village Code, the permit shall then be considered for approval by village staff. 
(G)  Use regulations. The uses within the B4A District are designed to permit a wide variety of retail sales activity required to meet the demands of a developing local market and promote attractive development, an open and pleasant street appearance and compatibility with adjacent residential areas. Related personal, professional and business services which are complimentary to the overall corridor and adjacent residences can generally be deemed appropriate, provided that such uses are integrated into the overall context of the corridor.

ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

§ 155.501 - Use of planned developments. 
(A)  A planned development is a conditional use which may be granted by the Village Board should it determine that the planned development is in the best interest of the village and complies with all the standards established in this section. The Plan Commission may recommend and the Village Board may require any reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote the proper development of the community. It is not intended that the Board automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density premiums of any proposed planned development. The Plan Commission shall only recommend the granting of such premiums or latitudes which are consistent with sound land use planning, village growth policy and benefits accruing to the village as a result of the planned development. 
(B)  As a condition of approval, each planned development must be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district or districts within which it is located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the official planning policies of the Village of Lombard. 
(Ord. 5606, passed 2/17/05) 
§ 155.502 - Intent of planned developments. 
(A)  The purpose of planned developments is to provide a mechanism to accommodate development which is in the public interest, and which would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this Chapter. A planned development may be of residential, commercial, office or industrial use. A planned development may also be of mixed use, subject to the regulation of such planned developments as specified in this section. 
(B)  A planned development is of a substantially different character than other uses described in this Chapter and is therefore, considered a conditional use. The regulations applicable to planned developments allow for far more flexibility than do the regulations for other uses. 
(C)  Planned developments possess unique attributes and can be surrounded by a wide variety of existing and proposed land uses Therefore, planned developments shall be evaluated and decided upon by the Plan Commission and the Village Board on a case-by-case basis. 
(D)  Specifically, planned developments are intended to provide for any or all of the following elements: 
(1)  A maximum choice in the types of development available to the public by allowing developments that would not be possible under the strict application of the terms of other sections of this Chapter. 
(2)  Permanent preservation of common space and recreation areas and facilities; 
(3)  A pattern of development to preserve topographic and geographic features, and natural vegetation; 
(4)  A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better development, design and the construction of aesthetic amenities; 
(5)  An efficient use of the land resulting in a more efficient provision of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds, and buildings, and other facilities; 
(6)  Innovations in residential, commercial, office and industrial development so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type, design and lay-out of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings. 
(7)  A unified and compatible design of buildings, structures and site improvements. 
(E)  As specified in this Chapter, a planned development shall be considered a conditional use and may be granted in those districts in which it is listed as a conditional use provided the planned development conforms with the procedures and standards of this section. Therefore, the planned development may depart from other requirements in other sections of this Chapter. However, every planned development shall conform to the intent and the character of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(F)  Planned developments are required in the following instances: 
(1)  Any property which has R6 or B5 District zoning and on which a principal building is proposed to be constructed. 
(2)  Any property which is rezoned to the R6, O, B1, B2, B3, B4, B4A, B5, B5A or I District and which meets the minimum lot area and width requirements for a planned development. 
(3)  Any variation request for a property which has R6, O, B1, B2, B3, B4, B4A, B5, B5A and I District zoning and which meet the minimum lot area and width requirement for a planned development. 
(G)  The planned development requirement identified in subsection 155.502(F) may be waived by the Director of Community Development, provided that the Director finds the following: 
(1)  That the rezoning petition does not involve the construction or expansion of an existing permitted use on the premises; or 
(2)  The development proposal meets all provisions of the zoning ordinance and the sign ordinance. 
Shall a waiver from the planned development requirement be granted by the Director, notice shall be provided to the Plan Commission. 
(Ord. 5606, passed 2/17/05)

(Ord. 5606, passed 2/17/05) 
§ 155.508 - Standards for planned developments. 
    Except as provided below, no planned development shall be approved unless the Village Plan Commission and the Village Board find that the development meets the standards for conditional uses, and the standards set forth in this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village Board may approve a planned development which does not comply with these standards or with the standards for conditional use, if the Board finds that the application of such standards, to the development being considered, would not be in the public interest. 
(A)  General standards. 
(1)  Except as modified by and approved in the final development plan, the proposed development complies with the regulations of the district or districts in which it is to be located. 
(2)  Community sanitary sewage and potable water facilities connected to a central system are provided. 
(3)  The dominant use in the proposed planned development is consistent with the recommendations of the comprehensive plan of the village for the area containing the subject site. 
(4)  That the proposed planned development is in the public interest and is consistent with the purposes of this zoning ordinance. 
(5)  That the streets have been designed to avoid: 
(a)  Inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned development; 
(b)  Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the planned development; 
(c)  An excessive burden on public parks, recreation areas, schools, and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the planned development. 
(B)  Standards for planned developments with use exceptions. The ordinance approving the Final Development Plan for the planned development may provide for uses in the planned development not allowed in the underlying district, provided the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Proposed use exceptions enhance the quality of the planned development and are compatible with the primary uses. 
(2)  Proposed use exceptions are not of a nature, nor are located, so as to create a detrimental influence in the surrounding properties. 
(3)  Proposed use exceptions shall not represent more than 40 percent of the site area or more than 40 percent of the total floor area, whichever is less. However, in a residential planned development area no more than ten percent of the site area or the total floor area shall be devoted to commercial use; furthermore, no industrial use shall be permitted. 
(C)  Standards for planned developments with deviations. The Village Board may approve planned developments which do not comply with the requirements of the underlying district regulations governing lot area, lot width, bulk regulations, parking and sign regulations, or which require modification of the subdivision design standards when such approval is necessary to achieve the objectives of the proposed planned development, but only when the board finds such deviations are consistent with the following standards: 
(1)  Any reduction in the requirements of this Chapter is in the public interest. 
(2)  The proposed deviations would not adversely impact the value or use of any other property. 
(3)  That such deviations are solely for the purpose of promoting better development which will be beneficial to the residents or occupants of the planned development as well as those of the surrounding properties. 
(4)  That the overall floor area of the planned development shall not exceed by more than 40 percent the maximum floor area permitted for the individual uses in each applicable district. 
(5)  That in residential planned developments the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall not exceed by more than 40 percent the number of dwelling units permitted in the underlying district. 
(6)  That all buildings are located within the planned development in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining buildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of such buildings and shall conform to the following: 
(a)  The front, side or rear yard setbacks on the perimeter of the development shall not be less than that required in the abutting zoning district(s) or the zoning district underlying the subject site, whichever is greater. 
(b)  All transitional yards and transitional landscape yards of the underlying zoning district are met. 
(c)  If required transitional yards and transitional landscape yards are not adequate to protect the privacy and enjoyment of property adjacent to the development, the Plan Commission shall recommend either or both of the following requirements: 
(i)  All structures located on the perimeter of the planned development must set back by a distance sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses; 
(ii)  All structures located along the entire perimeter of the planned development must be permanently screened with sight-proof screening in a manner which is sufficient to protect the privacy and amenity of adjacent existing uses. 
(7)  That the area of open space provided in a planned development shall be at least 25 percent more than that required in the underlying zone district. 
(Ord. 5606, passed 2/17/05) 
§ 155.509 - Minimum size requirements for planned developments. 
    In order to accrue the intended benefits of a planned development sought through these regulations, the area of a planned development shall conform to the following minimum area requirements for the district in which it is located.

§ 155.510 - Open space requirements for planned developments. 
(A)  Requirements relating to usability and preservation of common open space. Common open space shall be provided as a condition to the approval of any planned development. No open area may be delineated or accepted as common open space under the provisions of this Article unless it meets the following standards. 
(1)  The location, shape, size and character of the common open space must be suitable for the planned development. 
(2)  Common open space must be used as an aesthetic amenity or recreation purpose. The uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to the scale and character of the planned development, considering its size, density, expected population, topography, and the number and type of dwelling to be provided. 
(3)  Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use, but common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities, topography, and unimproved conditions of the common open space. 
(4)  The development schedule which is part of the development plan must coordinate the improvement of the common open space, the construction of the buildings, structures, and improvements in the common open space, and the construction of residential dwellings in the planned development. 
(5)  No portion of a planned development shall be conveyed or dedicated to public use by the developer or any other person to any public body or homeowners association unless the Board of Trustees determine that the character and quality of the tract to be conveyed makes it suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. When making its determination, the Board of Trustees shall give consideration to the size and character of the dwellings to be constructed within the planned development, the topography and existing amenities of the open area, including existing trees, groundcover, and other natural features; the manner in which open area is to be improved and maintained for recreational or amenity purposes; and the existence of public parks or on the public recreational facilities in the vicinity. 
(6)  All land shown on the final planned development plat as common open space must either be: 
(a)  Conveyed to a public body which agrees to accept conveyance, to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures, or improvements which have been placed on it; or 
(b)  Conveyed to an owner's association or similar organization organized for the purpose, among others, of owning and maintaining common buildings, areas, and land within the planned development. 
(c)  The common open space must be conveyed subject to covenants to be approved by the Board of Trustees which restricts the common open space to the uses specified on the final development plan, and which provides for the maintenance of the common open space. 
§ 155.511 - Site plan approval. 
    The village recognizes that individual units within larger planned developments frequently develop over a number of years and can encompass a variety of design features that are not typically addressed as part of an original planned development approval. Additionally, as approved planned developments mature, and individual tenants within a non-residential planned development change, parking and signage needs may also change. 
    The village recognizes the site plan approval process as a flexible method for review of individual components of the overall planned development. This process provides the ability of the plan commission to review, approve, deny or modify the individual developments as the individual units or components are intended to be developed. 
    The site plan approval process can either be requested by a property owner or required by the village. Petitioners requesting to utilize the site plan approval process shall include this request as part of the initial planned development review. The site plan approval process is subject to the review and approval of the Village Board after review and recommendation by the Lombard Plan Commission. 
    Should a planned development be approved with site plan approval for the individual components, the petitioner shall be required to submit any necessary and supporting documentation as requested by the village for each phase of the development. The information required to be submitted by the owner shall include, but not be limited to, building design and elevations, traffic generation, stormwater requirements, landscaping compliance, signage, parking and compatibility with the overall planned development and any other site plan approvals granted within the development. 
    For planned developments that have been approved prior to the effective date of the Ordinance, a petitioner may request the site plan approval process for signage and for parking per subsections 155.504(C) and 155.504(D) respectively.

ARTICLE X. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

§ 155.601 - Scope and application. 
(A)  Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Ordinance shall apply as follows: 
(1)  For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required below. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Chapter and provided that construction is begun within six months of such effective date and diligently executed to completion (completion to be accomplished within 18 months of the effective date of this Chapter), parking and loading facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this Chapter. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for 100 percent of any existing deficiency in parking or loading facilities. 
(B)  Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this Chapter and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below, the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this Chapter. 
(C)  Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design, and operation of such facilities are adhered to. 
(D)  Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this Chapter, which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Chapter for equivalent new uses or construction. 
(E)  Submission of required plans. Any application for a Building Permit, shall include therewith a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned showing any off-street parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this Chapter. Other information shall also be provided as required by the Director of Community Development to determine compliance including; number of existing parking spaces, seating capacity, number of employees or other information indicating the intensity of the principal use. 
§ 155.602 - Off-street parking. 
(A)  General requirements. 
(1)  Minimum spaces required. In any Business or Industrial District, parking shall be required as provided for in this section and a minimum of three spaces shall be provided for each use. 
(2)  Central area parking regulations. In the B5 Central Business District, the village desires to minimize disruptive curb cuts and driveways, and to encourage the consolidation of parking spaces in appropriate locations. Therefore, off-street parking in the B5 Central Business District shall be provided as follows: 
(a)  For the construction of new buildings, 50 percent of the number of off-street parking spaces indicated in Table 6.3 below shall be provided for non-residential uses, and 100 percent of the number of off-street parking spaces indicated in Table 6.3 below shall be provided for residential uses, with a minimum of three parking spaces per lot-of-record. 
(b)  Parking shall be provided to the side or rear of the building and shall be a minimum of five feet from the right-of-way. 
(3)  Location. 
(a)  All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses erected or established after the effective date of this Chapter shall be located on the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except as otherwise provided for in subsections 155.602(A)(3)(b), (c), (d) and (g), below. Existing buildings or uses altered such that additional parking is required shall provide such parking on the same zoning lot, except as otherwise provided for in subsections 155.602(A)(3)(b), (c), (d) and (g), below. 
(b)  Off-site parking spaces may be used to serve non-residential uses in the R6, O, B3, B4, B4A, B5A and I Districts. No off-site parking space shall be located further than 300 feet from the main entrance of the principal building to be served. Off-site parking shall be a conditional use in the above districts. Off-site parking facilities shall be subject to subsection 155.602(A)(4), below. 
(c)  Off-site parking spaces intended to serve non-residential uses in the B5 District shall be a permitted use, subject to subsection 155.602(A)(4) below. 
(d)  Owners of property legally nonconforming as to parking and located in the CR, R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, B1 and B2 Districts shall be allowed to provide parking off-site to become otherwise conforming. In such circumstances, the provision of such off-site parking shall be considered a conditional use and subject to the provisions of subsection 155.103(F) of this Chapter. 
(e)  Off-street parking spaces open to the sky, may be located in any yard, except that in the R4, R5, O, and I Districts, off-street parking shall not be located in a required front or corner side yard. However, In the R0, R1 and R2 Districts, not more than two vehicles may be parked overnight in a required front or corner side yard, and not more than three vehicles may be parked overnight in the required rear yard. 
(f)  All off-street parking spaces shall be located in a manner which allows for compliance with the provisions in § 155.700 of this Chapter. 
(g)  For all property owned by the Lombard Park District and located within the CR Conservation/Recreation District, required parking spaces may include those legal parking spaces within adjacent public rights-of-way that are located on the same side as, and abutting the subject property. The calculation of on-street parking for compliance with the parking requirements of this section shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director of Community Development. 
(4)  Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or long-term lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the Village Board. The deed or lease shall require such owner or his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner. 
For owners and/or operators of uses located within the B5 Districted that intend to satisfy the parking requirements by utilizing parking spaces owned by the Village of Lombard, the owner and/or operator shall enter into a parking agreement with the Village Board. However, this provision shall not be interpreted to automatically grant parking rights to a particular use for spaces owned by the village, but rather should be subject to the Village Board approval on a case-by-case basis. 
(5)  Size. Each off-street parking space shall have a standard length of 18 feet, zero inches. For parking stalls adjacent to landscape islands and more than five feet from a property line, the requisite stall width must be at least 16 feet, zero inches. In the case of parallel parking spaces the required length shall be 24 feet, zero inches. The width of parking spaces shall depend on the district in which the parking spaces are located, as established below: 
(a)  In the B1, B2, B3, B4, B4A, B5 and B5A Districts the width of parking spaces shall not be less than nine feet, zero inches. For parking lots with parking spaces that exceed the minimum amount of parking spaces as required by Table 6-3 of this section, the width of any excess spaces shall not be less than eight feet, three inches, provided that the reduced spaces are specifically designated for business, employee, and/or compact vehicles. 
(b)  In the O Office, I Industrial, all residence districts and publicly owned commuter lots, the width of parking spaces shall not be less than eight feet, three inches. 
The requirements for handicapped parking, both in terms of stall size and number of spaces required are established in subsection 155.602(B), below. 
(6)  Access. Except on single-family residential lots, each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of a width in conformance with the requirements of this Chapter. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movement. 
(7)  Collective provision. Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each use and the facilities adhere to all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served. Further, no parking space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use. 
(8)  Computation. 
(a)  The calculation of off-street parking based on floor area shall be interpreted to include the following: 
(i)  All floor area as defined by § 155.802 of this Chapter; 
(ii)  Accessory storage areas located within selling or working space such as counters, racks, closets; 
(iii)  Any floor area devoted to retailing activities; 
(iv)  Any floor area devoted to the production or processing of goods; 
(v)  Any floor area devoted to the business or professional offices; 
(b)  For purposes of measurement of off-street parking spaces, the following spaces shall not be included: 
(i)  Floor area devoted primarily to storage purposes (unless specifically listed in subsection a above); 
(ii)  Floor area devoted to off-street parking or loading facilities, including aisles, ramps, and maneuvering space, or; 
(iii)  Mechanical or storage floor area (unless specifically listed in subsection a above). 
When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance requires a computation of square footage of gross floor area, any portion of the gross floor area between the 1,000 square foot intervals shall also be included in the computation. 
Example: Freestanding Retail Store: 11,600 square feet of gross floor area. 
Required \ Parking: Four spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. 
In this example, the parking requirement shall be computed by dividing the four spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area, which equals 250 square feet per parking space. Divide the square footage of gross floor area of the use (11,600) by the 250 square feet per parking space to derive the requisite parking of 46.4 spaces (11,600/250 = 46.4 spaces). 
When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as one parking space. Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing on the premises at any one time. 
To continue the previous example, the calculated parking requirement of 46.4 spaces would be rounded down to 46 spaces. 
(9)  Utilization. Required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed in subsection 155.602(B), below, shall be solely for the temporary parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses. 
(10)  Design and maintenance. All off-street parking lots shall be designed and maintained in conformance with the specific requirements established below. 
(a)  Plan: The design of parking lots shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Community Development in accordance with standards established by this Chapter, and those established by the Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees in the case of variations, conditional uses and planned developments. 
(b)  Character: Accessory parking spaces may be opened to the sky, or enclosed in a building or structure. 
(c)  Surfacing: All open off-street parking areas and maneuvering areas shall be surfaced with dustless, all weather material of asphalt or concrete. Parking is not permitted within any open space, on grass, or in a landscape area. Proper drainage of parking lots shall be required. 
(d)  Lighting: 
(i)  Parking lots shall be illuminated according to the standards listed below at all times that the parking lot is open for general use. 
(ii)  Parking lot lighting shall be provided at a minimum intensity of 0.5 foot-candles at all points within the parking lot, and at an average intensity of no less than 2.0 foot-candles. 
(iii)  Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed away from adjacent properties and streets in such a way as not to create a nuisance. In no case shall such lighting exceed 0.5 foot-candles at any property line which is shared by a residentially-zoned property, a property which has residential uses on the first floor, or a residential street. In no case shall such lighting exceed 3.0 foot-candles at any property line. 
(iv)  Light poles which are used for parking lot lighting shall not exceed 40 feet in height, except that light poles which are used for parking lot lighting for shared pedestrian access shopping centers (i.e. regional shopping malls), parking lot light poles shall not exceed 45 feet in height. 
(e)  Curbing: All parking lots shall be provided with perimeter concrete curbing (six inch barrier curb). Such curbing shall be designed so that no part of any parked vehicle shall encroach into a required yard. 
(f)  Shelter building: No parking lot for accessory off-street parking shall have more than one attendant shelter building per entrance which shall conform to all setback requirements for accessory structures established by § 155.210 of this Chapter, and any other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 
(g)  Signs: Accessory signs shall be permitted on parking areas in accordance with the provisions specified in the Village of Lombard Sign Ordinance. 
(11)  Business vehicle parking spaces. All business vehicles shall be parked in designated business vehicle parking spaces. The Director of Community Development shall review and approve the proposed location of business vehicle parking spaces. When site considerations allow, business vehicle parking spaces shall be visually separated from public streets and residential areas. 
(B)  Accessible parking requirements. Accessible (handicapped) parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with the Illinois Accessibility Code. 
(1)  Size: Each accessible parking stall shall consist of an eight-foot wide parking space and an adjacent eight-foot wide access aisle. The standard length of accessible parking stalls shall be the same as all other parking stalls. 
(2)  Number: All parking lots required by this Chapter shall provide the number of accessible parking stalls. 
(3)  Access: The required access aisle must have a smooth transition with adjacent walk surfaces, either by joining at a common level or by use of a curb ramp. 
(4)  Identification: Each accessible parking space shall be equipped with a sign which complies with Section 11-301 of the Illinois Rules of the Road. Signs shall be vertically mounted on a post or a wall at front center of the parking space, no more than five feet horizontally from the front of the parking space, and set four feet from finished grade of the parking space to the bottom of the sign. 
(C)  Specific requirements. All off-street parking spaces hereinafter required by this ordinance, except those required for one- and two-family dwellings, shall be designed in accordance with one of the formulae set forth in Figure 6-1 and Table 6.2, which is attached hereto and made a part hereof. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the specific uses listed in Table 6.3. Stacking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the specific uses listed in Table 6.4. Parking spaces for accessory activities not specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or conditional) use requirement. If a use is not specifically listed on Table 6.3, the Director of Community Development shall determine like uses listed in the table for the purposes of determining parking space requirements.

ARTICLE XI. - LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 

§ 155.701 - Purpose. 
    The landscaping and screening requirements specified herein are intended to foster aesthetically pleasing development which will protect and preserve the appearance, character, health, safety, and welfare of the community. Specifically, these regulations are intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses, and, in doing so, minimize the harmful impact of noise, dust and other debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or created by an adjoining or nearby use. 
§ 155.702 - Scope and application. 
(A)  Scope of regulations. 
(1)  For all construction of principal buildings, landscaping shall be provided and maintained in full compliance with the standards described below. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any existing building, structure, or premises shall be increased through the construction of a principal building or the construction of a building addition or accessory building in which the combined gross floor area exceeds 20 percent of existing buildings or 2,000 square feet; full compliance with the landscaping required herein shall be provided. The Director of Community Development may modify the landscaping standards for such increases in intensity of use if the Director determines that any or all of the following conditions exist or are proposed. 
(a)  The location of an existing building prevents full compliance with the landscape standards; 
(b)  Compliance with the landscaping standards would reduce the number of existing parking spaces below the required number of parking spaces; 
(c)  Additional landscaping would not substantially improve traffic control, perimeter buffering, or streetscape/front yard appearance; 
(d)  All existing and proposed landscape planting areas will be provided with the required amount of planting materials; 
(e)  Wherever possible, landscape islands are provided at the end of parking rows, landscaping planting strips are provided around the perimeter of parking lots, required parkway landscaping is provided, and appropriate fencing, berming, or landscaping is provided adjacent to residential areas. 
(B)  Landscape plan required. A landscape plan shall be required for all exterior construction and development activity. Such landscape plan shall conform with the requirements specified in this section. Landscape plans must be approved by the Director of Community Development prior to the issuance of a building permit for exterior construction and development. The construction of single-family residences shall be exempted from this requirement. 
(C)  Content of landscape plan. All landscape plans submitted for approval shall contain or have attached thereto the following information: 
(1)  The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, parking lots and drives, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, bicycle parking areas, fences, freestanding electrical equipment, tot lots and other recreational facilities, and other freestanding structural features as determined necessary by the Director of Community Development. 
(2)  The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common names, of all proposed planting materials. 
(3)  The location of existing buildings, structures and plant materials on adjacent property within 100 feet of the site. 
(4)  Existing and proposed grading of the site, including proposed berming, indicating contours, at one-foot intervals.
