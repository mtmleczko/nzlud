PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Westlake, Louisiana. 
    Source materials used in the republication of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through October 20, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The parts of the Code have been conveniently arranged into sets of chapters of like subject matter, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, provides sufficient reference points for the reader. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
    Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repealer and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part 1 of the Code that applies to the entire Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes, state law references, and amendment notes have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions. 
Part, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The part, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is similar to that used in many local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the part number, and the figure after the dash refers to the chapter number and position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of part 2, chapter 3 is numbered 2-3002, and the first section of part 7, chapter 2 is 7-2001. Under this system, each section is identified with its part and chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 7-1001 and 7-1002 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 7-1001.5. New chapters and new articles may be included in the same way or, in the case of chapters, may be placed at the end of the part embracing the subject, and, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new chapter or article. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The numbers to the left of the dash refer to the part numbers of the volume. The number to the right of the dash represents the page number in that part. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter to the left of the dash indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 1-1 APPENDIX A-1 SPECIAL ACTS AND RELATED LEGISLATION SA-1 TABLE OF ORDINANCES TO-1 CODE INDEX I-1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    With this republication by Municipal Code Corporation, the entire Code volume was reproduced and should be issued as a replacement volume. Henceforth, the successful maintenance of keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As subsequent revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Patience Gaia, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Andrea Mahfouz, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

CHAPTER 2. - SEWAGE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT 
ARTICLE A. - USER CHARGE SYSTEM[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Sec. 1 of Ord. No. 412, enacted Apr. 11, 1985, repealed former Ch. 2, Art. A, §§ 7-2001-7-2004, and § 2 of the ordinance enacted, in lieu thereof, new §§ 7-2001-7-2004 as herein set forth. The repealed provisions pertained to sewer connection and appeared to derive from Ord. No. 75A, enacted Oct. 1, 1959. 

Sec. 7-2001. - Requirements; purpose. 
    The city, as recipient of federal grant assistance in the construction of collection line extensions and the proposed construction of regional transport facilities, is required to develop and enact a user charge system to fairly distribute annual operation and maintenance costs among all users and/or user classes. This user charge system was based on a model developed for the regional wastewater system and enacted by the City of Sulphur and EPA model programs. 
(Ord. No. 412, § 2, 4-11-85) 
Sec. 7-2002. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this article, the following words and terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed: 
    BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedures in five (5) days at twenty (20) degrees Celsius, expressed in parts per million by weight, milligram per liter (mg/l). 
    Conventional pollutant means those pollutants that are generally biodegradable and readily handled within normal concentration ranges by conventional treatment processes. Conventional pollutants specifically include biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, fecal coliform, pH, and oil and grease. 
    Domestic wastewater means the liquid waste normally originating in quarters inhabited or frequented by human beings and may include human excreta, bath water, kitchen wastes, (with or without properly shredded garbage) and laundry waste. 
    Industrial users means any nongovernmental, nonresidential user of a publicly owned treatment work which discharges more than the equivalent of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day of sanitary wastes as defined in 40 CFR 35.903 of Federal Rules and Regulations. 
    Nonconventional pollutants means all other pollutants which are not specifically identified as either conventional or toxic and includes pollutants as chemical oxygen demand (COD), phosphorus, sulfates, chlorides, etc. 
    Nonresidential customers means all other customers receiving wastewater service and includes, but is not limited to, commercial establishments, churches, schools, nursing homes and hospitals. 
    Normal wastewater concentrations means wastewater having characteristics generally associated with typical domestic wastewater and which shall have the following limits: 
BOD, 5 days at 20°C 220 mg/l (max.) Chlorine demand 15 minutes, 68°F 25 mg/l (max.) Suspended solids 220 mg/l (max.) Hydrogen ion concentration (pH) 5.0 to 9.5 Oil and grease 100 mg/l (max.) Temperature 125°F (max.) NHg-N 30 mg/l (max.)  
    Objectionable pollutant means those toxic and nonconventional pollutants causing an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge of the treatment waste. Suggested maximum limits for some objectionable pollutants are defined in the sewer user ordinance. 
    Operation and maintenance costs means those costs associated with the necessary operational requirements of a wastewater treatment facility, including replacement. 
    pH means the logarithm of the reciprocal of the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter of solution. 
    Prohibited pollutants means any toxic or non-conventional pollutants that would cause problems in the adequate treatment of the wastewater and would be required to be removed prior to any discharge into the wastewater system. 
    Replacement means expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories, or appurtenances which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance of the treatment works during its service life. 
    Residential customer equivalent (RCE) equals the average daily return flow of one (1) typical residential customer. Contributions from nonresidential users will be converted to RCEs by dividing nonresidential contribution by this determined return residential flow if the nonresidential user is nonmetered. 
    Residential customers means those customers living in homes, apartments, townhouses and trailers. 
    Suspended solids shall mean solids that either float on the surface of or are in suspension, in water, sewage or other liquids and which are removable by laboratory filtering. 
    Toxic pollutants means those pollutants which have been designated as toxic under Section 307 of the 1972 Clean Water Act, including all additions to the list and all amendments to the subject act. 
    User charge means a charge levied on users of a treatment works for the user's proportionate share of the cost of operation and maintenance of such works and debt service as determined by the city. 
(Ord. No. 412, § 2, 4-11-85) 
Sec. 7-2003. - User charge rate formula. 
(a)	User charge formula for normal use. In cases where pollutant concentration of the wastewater contributed by a user is below or near the normal range of domestic pollutant concentration and does not contain any objectionable pollutants, the user's charges are to be based on an estimated volume basis in accordance with the following equation: 
Cu = (Ct/Vt) × (Vu) 
where: 
 Cu =  A user's charge for O & M per unit of time. 
 Ct =  Total O & M costs per unit of time. 
 Vt =  Total volume contribution from all users per unit of time. 
 Vu =  Volume contribution from a user per unit of time. 
(b)	Calculation of wastewater volume contribution. Volume contribution by all nonmetered users will be calculated in the following manner for each category: 
(1)	Residential customers. Contribution from each nonmetered residential customer shall be based on the average daily return flow of all residential customers. The calculation shall be based upon an engineering analysis using available wastewater flow and water consumption information. The contribution from a residential customer will be equal to one (1) residential customer equivalent. 
(2)	Nonmetered nonresidential customers. Wastewater contribution from nonmetered, nonresidential customers shall be calculated by an engineering analysis of the establishment's operation and reasonable flow contribution assumptions. In instances where contribution is found to be equal to or less than one (1) residential customer equivalent, the user, or user class, will be charged a minimum commercial rate. Where the contribution is found to be greater than one (1) residential customer equivalent, the contribution will be converted to residential customer equivalents for billing purposes. 
(3)	Metered customers. Contribution from metered customers is to be based on a percentage of water consumption. In cases where the water consumption and return flow are shown to be closely correlated, a percent return factor shall be developed for each user or user class to calculate wastewater contribution. The formula under section 7-2003(a) above shall be utilized. In cases where water consumption and return flow do not correlate, such as users having large sprinkling needs, contribution shall be calculated by an engineering analysis of the customer's operation and water consumption for the past twelve (12) months. Where the wastewater contribution is found to be greater than one (1) resident customer equivalent, the contribution is to be converted to RCEs for billing purposes. 
(4)	Tie-in fees for sewer outside the corporate limits of the city: 
For residential customers, per tie-in + inspection fee ..... $150.00 
For commercial/industrial customers, per tie-in + inspection fee ..... 250.00 
For trailer parks and apartment complexes (not more than twenty (20) units), per tie-in + inspection fees ..... 250.00 
(c)	Surcharge for excessive pollutant concentrations: 
(1)	Conventional pollutants. In the event that conventional pollutant concentrations from a user exceeds the normal range of strength of normal wastewater, a surcharge shall be levied. The use of such a surcharge would be necessary if an industry discharging a wastewater has a higher range of strength, is located within the city and desires to have wastewater treatment service. The surcharge would be by the following formula: 
Cs = (Bc(b) + Sc(s)) × Vu 
where: 
 Cs =  Surcharge for sewage of excessive strength. 
 Bc =  O & M cost for treatment of a unit of BOD. 
 B =  Concentration of BOD from a user above a base level of 220 mg/l. 
 Sc =  O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids (SS). 
 S =  Concentration of SS from a user above a base level of 220 mg/l. 
 Vu =  Volume concentration from a user per unit of time. 
(2)	Nonconventional pollutants. In the event that objectionable pollutants or other nonconventional pollutants are discharged into the system and cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge of the treatment works, the city shall take action to determine such cost and levy a surcharge to that user. In no instance shall prohibited heavy metals or toxic materials be discharged into the wastewater system. 
(d)	Cost development, user classes and user charges: 
(1)	Cost development. The user charge system shall be sufficient to cover the projected cost of wastewater system operation, maintenance and normal replacement for projected year of system service. Additionally the charge system shall provide adequate revenues to cover wastewater system debt service including required reserves as determined by the city. 
The projected cost shall be developed at least once a year at a time selected by the governing officials of the city. The costs will be developed each year in accordance with Exhibit A attached to Ordinance No. 412 and made a part hereof. 
(2)	User classes (groups). The user classes (groups) shall be in accordance with Exhibit A. For each user class (groups) the residential customer equivalent (RCE) will be developed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit A. 
The user classes (groups) and corresponding RCE factor equivalent will be reviewed at least once per year when the system is reviewed. 
(3)	User charge fee structure. The user charge fee structure shall be developed in accordance with Exhibit A and shall be sufficient to cover the cost of operation, maintenance, normal replacement as well as required debt service. The fee structure shall adequately distribute the cost to each user class (group) based on their RCE factor equivalent. 
The user charge fee structure shall be reviewed at least once per year at the same time the cost of the system is developed. The user fee structure shall be appropriately increased to sufficiently cover the projected costs. 
(Ord. No. 412, § 2, 4-11-85; Ord. No. 556, 1-11-96) 
Sec. 7-2004. - User charge policy requirements. 
(a)	General requirements. The user charge system shall be revised accordingly to accomplish the following: 
(1)	Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among the users and users classes as required herein. 
(2)	Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment works and meet debt service limits set by the city. 
(3)	Apply excess revenues collected from users or a class of users to the costs and operation and maintenance fund, and adjust the rate accordingly in the following year. 
(b)	Review period. It shall be the policy of the city to review the user charge system at least once per year to ensure the above general requirements are met. It also shall be the policy of the city to review all user rate structures not less than every year to ensure a fair distribution of costs. 
(c)	Notification. It shall be the policy of the city that each user be notified in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater services. 
(d)	Complaints. It shall be the policy of the city to formally review complaints on sewer charges to a user or user class at any regularly scheduled city council meeting upon adequate notice. 
(e)	Exhibits. The following exhibit is a part of this article: 
_____
EXHIBIT A. DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING
OPERATING COST, USER CLASSES AND USER CHARGE (FEE)
FOR WASTEWATER SYSTEM OF
CITY OF WESTLAKE, LOUISIANA 
A.	General. 
    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that all grant recipients adopt a system of charges to assure that each user of the wastewater service pay its proportionate share of costs of operating expenses, including replacement of equipment. The EPA further requires that this user charge system be annually reviewed and revised as needed. The user charge system must generate sufficient revenue to offset the cost of the sewerage works operation and the system must be incorporated in a municipal legislative act. 
B.	Capital Improvements Cost Recovery. 
    Past sewer improvements within the City of Westlake have been financed by several methods, including the use of general obligation bonds, a waterworks and sewerage utility revenue bond, federal grants, and special assessments on the property. Currently, the only outstanding revenue bond is being paid from the waterworks and sewerage utility fund, which receives its funds from water sales, sewer sales, tie-in fees, and a sales tax supplement. The general obligation bonds are being retired through the collection of ad valorem taxes. 
C.	User Charge Schedule. 
1.	Normal use. The city currently does not have a metered water system except for large users; therefore, a user system based on the establishment of user classes having similar flows and wastewater characteristic is utilized. Under this system, each class is assigned its share of wastewater contribution. Since there is no industrial waste as such in Westlake and the pollutant concentrations discharged by all users are approximately equal, the user charges for operation and maintenance costs can be developed using the following equation: 
(a)	Formula for Computing User Charge: 
Cu = (Ct/Vt) × (Vu) 
Where: 
Cu = A user's charge for O & M per unit of time. 
Ct = Total O & M costs per unit of time. 
Vt = Total volume-contribution from all users per unit of time. 
Vu = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time. 
In order to utilize the above formula, a residential customer equivalent is calculated for each user class receiving sewer service. The equivalent calculations are based on flow data presented in the West Calcasieu Wastewater Facility Plan and available sewage flow guides, [and] serve as the means to distribute the annual O & M costs. The residential customer equivalent is based on an average daily base flow of 100 gallons per capita and 3.4 persons per household. 
In anticipating the annual operating cost requirement, it is important to note that the waterworks and sewage utilities are combined in a single utility fund. Although these services are combined, an estimated cost attributed toward sewer service shall be determined through communication with the water and sewer department personnel, review of the annual statement of expenses, and a depreciation summary of plant facilities contained in the accountant's report. 
For the initial projected costs of operation, maintenance and replacement, the figures for the collection system regional transport system and regional treatment plant are taken from the EPA approved Step I Regional Wastewater Facility Plan (C-220339) and appropriately indexed utilizing standard cost indexes published by EPA. The specific details and categorized breakdown of costs can be reviewed by referencing the facility plan. 
a.	Projected Annual Operating Costs for Wastewater System by System Component are: 
System Component Projected Annual Cost City Collection $ 30,122.00 North Regional Transport 39,172.00 Regional Treatment 68,560.00 Total $137,854.00

340 gal/customer = 5.8, use 6  
9.	Business Establishments (having little or no services related to water use): 
Use RCE = 1 
c.	Total Residential Customers-Equivalent (RCE): 
User Class No. RCE Total Residential Customer 1715 1 1715 High School 1 33 33 Junior High School 1 38 38 Westwood Elementary 1 14 14 Western Heights Elem. 1 17 17 Restaurant, etc. 6 4 24 Coin-Operated Laundry 4 9 36 Conventional Laundry 1 10 10 Service Station 6 3 18 Coin-Operated Car Wash 1 5 5 Automatic Car Wash 1 6 6 Other Commercial 25 1 25 Total RCE = 1,932  
The proposed user charge schedule by user class for recovery of operating costs including replacement is therefore as follows: 
Monthly Charge per RCE = $137,854.00 ÷ 1932 ÷ 12 mo. = 5.95/mo., use 6.00/mo.

2.	Surcharge for Excessive Pollutant Concentrations. In the event that pollutant concentrations from a user exceed the normal range of strength of normal domestic sewage (BOD and SS concentrations of around 200), it is proposed that a surcharge be levied. The use of such a surcharge could be necessary if an industry discharging a wastewater having a higher range of strength were located within the city and desired to have wastewater treatment service. The surcharge would be by the following formula: 
Cs = (Bc(B) + SC(S)) × Vu 
Where: 
Cs = Surcharge for sewage of excessive strength. 
Bc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of BOD. 
B = Concentration of BOD from a user above a base level of 200 mg/l. 
Sc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids (SS). 
S = Concentration of SS from a user above a base level of 200 mg/l. 
Vu = Volume concentration from a user per unit of time. 
In the previous equation, volume costs per user is automatically accounted for by Vu; therefore, the total O & M surcharge cost will be considered to be due to either BOD or SS. Assuming that BOD accounts for 55% and SS accounts for 45% of an assumed total annual expense of $50,000 for treatment only, the user's cost attributable to each can be calculated as follows: 
BOD Cost: 55% of $50,000.00 = $27,500.00 per year $ 2,300.00 per year SS Cost: 45% of $50,000.00 = $22,500.00 per year $ 1,900.00 per year  
Existing Sewage Flow (Excluding Infiltration) = 20 MG per month 
Unit Cost and Proposed Surcharge Rate: 
Bc = $2,300.00/(200 × 20) = $.60 per mg/l per MG per month 
Sc = $1,900.00/(200 × 20) = $.50 per mg/l per MG per month 
Example Calculation of Surcharge: 
Vc = 50,000 gal. per month = .05 MG per month 
Bc = $.60 per mg/l per MG per month 
B  = 100 mg/l excess (above 200 mg/l) 
Sc = $.50 per mg/l per MG per month 
S  = 0 
CS - [($.60 × 100) + ($.50 × 0)] × 0.05 = $3.00 per mo. 
Note:  The above surcharge rate and charge calculation is for example purposes only. This procedure will be used for actual cases using actual figures. 
D.	Implementation and Recommendations of System. 
    It is recommended that the above procedures be utilized to develop user fees for wastewater services. Additionally it is recommended that a corresponding change in the water rate structure be implemented in order to prevent excess revenue and in order to maintain the same relative cost for water and sewer service. Since the customer equivalents of the user classes were based on estimated flows, it is recommended that the city undertake a small project to meter all commercial users. This metering would enable the city to help fairly distribute the cost to the users of both water and sewer service. This system would also help to encourage water reduction practices which could help to lower the operating cost of both the water and sewer systems. It is also recommended that the city allow some consideration for small establishments within the user classes whose actual flow may not reflect the anticipated flow of a typical user within the class. Under this recommendation, it is suggested that the user provide evidence that his water use is less than the flow in the user charge system analysis. 
E.	User Charge Schedule. 
Wastewater User Charge Schedule City of Westlake 
(1)	Residential Monthly Sewer User 
A.	Flat rate ..... $28.50/month 
B.	Senior Citizen-Flat rate ..... $15.00/month 
(2)	Commercial Monthly Sewer User 
Based on users with metered water = Monthly water usage (gallons) divided by 8,000 for a sum that is multiplied by 33.00 to get dollar amount.

    Upon written request by an LVU, City shall provide to such LVU copies of agreements which City has executed with Transporters to provide for transportation and delivery of Gas under the Contract with such LVU to the Delivery Point specified in such Contract. An LVU may make recommendations to City with respect to any proposed transportation arrangements providing for transportation and delivery of Gas under the Contract with such LVU to the relevant Delivery Point. City and each LVU shall use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate periodically and consistently with one another to discuss such LVU's recommendations and other alternatives with respect to transportation and delivery of Gas under the Contract with such LVU to the relevant Delivery Point. Provided, however, City, in its sole discretion, may accept or reject any such LVU recommendations or proposed transportation and delivery alternatives as City shall retain control for transporting Gas to the relevant Delivery Point and have responsibility for transporting Gas to the relevant Delivery Point under each Contract consistent with the provisions of this section 7-5007(a). City shall follow customary industry practices in Contracting for transportation with Transporters to provide for delivery of Gas under each Contract. Each LVU acknowledges that, as of the date of enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, customary industry practices with Transporters provide for transportation agreements with terms which do not exceed five (5) years (not including any renewal terms). In the event of an amendment, supplement, modification or termination with respect to (i) any agreement with any Transporter or (ii) any agreement with City's Gas suppliers which will result in any curtailment in City providing for delivery of Gas under a Contract with an LVU, City shall provide Notice of such event to such relevant LVU. 
(b)	City and each LVU shall coordinate with respect to City's nomination activities, giving sufficient time to meet the deadlines of the affected Transporter(s). City and each LVU shall give the other party timely prior Notice, sufficient to meet the requirements of all Transporter(s) involved in the transaction, of the quantities of Gas to be delivered and purchased each Day. Should either City or an LVU become aware that actual deliveries at a Delivery Point under a Contract are greater or lesser than the scheduled Gas, City and each LVU shall promptly notify the other party. 
(c)	City and each LVU shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If City receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges with respect to a Contract with an LVU, City and each LVU shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of LVU's actions or inactions, then LVU shall pay City the amount of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of City's actions or inactions, then City shall pay for such Imbalance Charges. 
(Ord. No. 801 , § 2, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 7-5008. - Quality and measurement. 
    All Gas delivered by City shall conform to the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Transporter for such Gas. The unit of quantity measurement for purposes of this chapter shall be one (1) MMBtu dry. Gas sold under a Contract shall be measured through Transporter's existing measurement facilities at the Delivery Point under such Contract in accordance with provisions of Transporter's applicable FERC Gas Tariff and the measurement standards and procedures in any applicable transportation agreement between City and Transporter. 
(Ord. No. 801 , § 2, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 7-5009. - Billing, payment, and audit. 
(a)	City, or a third party acting on behalf of City, shall invoice each LVU on or before the fifteenth (15 th ) Day of each Month at rates and charges for Gas service in accordance with the Monthly Rates included in Schedule 2 attached to the ordinance from which this chapter derives for Gas delivered and received hereunder in the preceding Month and for any other applicable charges (including Capacity Charges, Additional Charges and any other charges under the Monthly Rate). If requested by an LVU, City shall provide supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount charged such LVU. If the actual quantity delivered under a Contract is not known by the billing date, billing will be prepared based on the quantity of scheduled Gas for such Contract. The invoiced quantity will then be adjusted to the actual quantity on the following Month's billing for such Contract or as soon thereafter as actual delivery information is available. 
(b)	Each LVU shall remit the amount due from it under section 7-5009(a) of this chapter in the manner specified in the applicable Contract, in immediately available funds to be paid in U.S. dollars, on or before the later of (i) the Payment Date or (ii) ten (10) Days after receipt of the invoice by LVU; provided that if the later of (i) or (ii) immediately above is not a Business Day, payment is due on the next Business Day following that date. In the event any payments are due to an LVU under a Contract, payment to such LVU shall be made in a manner consistent with this section 7-5009(b). Each LVU shall remit the amount due under each invoice sent to such LVU in immediately available funds to be paid on or before 10:00 a.m. Central Time on the relevant date for payment as provided under this section 7-5009(b). In the event that City is providing Gas service to an LVU under two (2) or more Contracts, and to the extent that the LVU makes a partial payment under the provisions of section 7-5009(a) of this chapter, then City shall allocate payments remitted by the LVU under section 7-5009(a) of this chapter pro rata based on the Contract Quantity for the invoiced period for each Contract. 
(c)	In the event any payment becomes due pursuant to section 7-5006 of this chapter, the performing party may submit an invoice to the nonperforming party setting forth the basis upon which the invoiced amount was calculated. Payment from the nonperforming party will be due on or before five (5) Business Days after receipt of the invoice by the nonperforming party. In the event that City is providing Gas service to an LVU under two (2) or more Contracts, and to extent that LVU makes a partial payment under the provisions of section 7-5009(c) of this chapter, then City shall allocate payments remitted by LVU under this section 7-5009(c) pro rata based on the invoiced quantity of Gas billed under this section 7-5009(c) for each Contract. 
(d)	If City or an LVU, in good faith, disputes the amount of any such invoice delivered under a Contract pursuant to this section 7-5009, or any part thereof, the invoiced party will pay such amount invoiced; provided, however, if the invoiced party disputes the amount due, it must provide supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount disputed without undue delay. The parties shall then confer and attempt to resolve the disputed amount by agreement. In the event the parties are unable to resolve such dispute, either party may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights pursuant to the Contract. 
(e)	If City or an LVU fails to remit the full amount of any invoice delivered under a Contract pursuant to this section 7-5009 when due (other than disputed amounts), interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lower of (i) the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two (2) percent per annum; or (ii) the maximum applicable lawful interest rate. In addition, if an LVU fails to remit the full amount payable when due under a Contract pursuant to section 7-5009(b) of this chapter for rates and charges invoiced by City each Month under section 7-5009(a) of this chapter, then LVU shall pay a late payment fee equal to the product of (i) the Contract Quantity under such Contract for a Month and (ii) the ratio of the unpaid amount over the total amount billed to the LVU under such Contract for such Month, multiplied by twenty (20) cents per MMBtu. Provided, however, in the event that City exercises its right to setoff any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount provided by an LVU against any amount due and owing by such LVU to City pursuant to the provisions of section 7-5011(a)(2) of this chapter, City shall assess a late payment fee in a reduced amount equal to the product of (i) the Contract Quantity under the Contract with such LVU for a Month and (ii) the ratio of the unpaid amount over the total amount billed to LVU under such Contract for such Month, multiplied by five (5) cents per MMBtu. A late payment fee shall be assessed by City against each LVU for each failure by such LVU to make the applicable Monthly payment when due under section 7-5009(b) of this chapter. In the event any late payment fee becomes due from an LVU pursuant to this section 7-5009(e), City shall submit an invoice to such LVU setting forth the basis upon which the late payment fee was calculated. Payment of each amount due from an LVU under this section 7-5009(e) will be due on or before five (5) Business Days after receipt of the invoice by the LVU. 
(f)	An invoice delivered pursuant to section 7-5009 shall constitute notice of the amount payable by a party for purposes of section 7-5011(b). 
(Ord. No. 801 , § 2, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 7-5010. - Title and warranty. 
(a)	Title to the Gas delivered to an LVU under a Contract shall pass from City to such LVU at the Delivery Point under such Contract. City shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to the Gas to be delivered to an LVU under a Contract prior to its delivery to the LVU at the specified Delivery Point under such Contract. Each LVU shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to Gas to be delivered to such LVU under a Contract after its delivery to such LVU at the Delivery Point under such Contract. 
(b)	City warrants that it will have the right to convey and will transfer good and merchantable title to all Gas sold hereunder and delivered by it to an LVU, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims. Except as provided in this section 7-5010(b) and in Part 13.11 of each Local Services Agreement, all other warranties, express or implied, including any warranty of merchantability or of fitness for any particular purpose, are disclaimed. 
(c)	Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section 7-5010, as between City and each LVU, City will be liable for all claims to the extent that such claims arise from the failure of Gas delivered by City to meet the quality requirements of section 7-5008 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 801 , § 2, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 7-5011. - Financial responsibility. 
(a)	With respect to the initial Adequate Assurance of Performance for an LVU under a Local Services Agreement, LVU or LVU's Guarantor shall provide Adequate Assurance of Performance as set forth in the initial demand for Adequate Assurance of Performance under Part 13.10 of the applicable Local Services Agreement on or before the Initial Valuation Date. Throughout the term of each Contract, the applicable LVU or such LVU's Guarantor shall maintain Adequate Assurance of Performance at all times. The initial Adequate Assurance of Performance shall be as provided for in Part 13.10 of the Local Services Agreement and the Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount shall be deposited, invested and applied in accordance with section 7-5011(a)(5) of this chapter. As provided for under section 7-5011(a)(7) of this chapter, City shall designate a Qualified Institution(s) to act as a custodian and fiduciary on behalf of City with respect to depositing, investing and/or applying Adequate Assurance Deposit Amounts under the provisions of this chapter. Such funds may only be invested in the Permitted Investments. Each LVU hereby grants to City, and City's designee, a continuing first priority security interest in, lien on, and right of setoff against all Adequate Assurance Deposit Amounts transferred by such LVU to City. Upon the return by City (or City's designee) to an LVU of any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount, the security interest and lien granted hereunder on that Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount shall be released automatically and, to the extent possible, without any further action by either party. 
(1)	If at any time (i) an LVU or an LVU's Guarantor fails to make any two (2) payments within any twelve (12) month period on or before the applicable date for payment as provided for under a Contract with such LVU or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing, City shall demand such LVU provide an Adequate Assurance of Performance which shall be an Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount equal to the Adequate Assurance Valuation Amount. Within three (3) Business Days after such demand is made by City to an LVU, such LVU or LVU's Guarantor shall provide Adequate Assurance of Performance which shall be an Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount provided by LVU to City (or City's designee) in an amount equal to the Adequate Assurance Valuation Amount. 
(2)	City shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to setoff against any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount provided by an LVU or LVU's Guarantor any amounts due and owing by such LVU under the terms of a Contract(s) with such LVU including, but not limited to, any amounts due and owing by such LVU under section 7-5009(a), section 7-5009(b), section 7-5011(c)(1) or section 7-5011(c)(2) of this chapter. Within one (1) Business Day after City exercises its right of setoff under this section 7-5011(a)(2) and applies funds from LVU's Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount against any amounts due and owing by such LVU under the terms of a Contract with such LVU, City, or a third party acting on behalf of City, shall provide Notice to LVU which shall include the amount that LVU shall be required to provide to City (or its designee) so that the Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount shall be replenished. Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice by an LVU, such LVU shall provide to City (or City's designee) the amount necessary to replenish the Adequate Assurance of Performance as set forth in such notice provided by City to LVU. 
(3)	In the event that (i) an LVU or an LVU's Guarantor with a Minimum Credit Rating has provided Adequate Assurance of Performance pursuant to section 7-5011(a)(1) of this chapter and thereafter has made all payments under all Contracts of such LVU on or before the applicable dates for payment for twelve (12) consecutive Months and (ii) such LVU or LVU's Guarantor has not caused or permitted to occur an Event of Default under section 7-5011(b) of this chapter, then City shall return (or cause its designee to return) to LVU all or a portion of the Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount. Provided, however, such LVU shall continue to provide and maintain Adequate Assurance of Performance under section 7-5011(a) of this chapter, including any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount provided for under Part (i) of the definition of Adequate Assurance of Performance. In the event that LVU subsequently fails to meet the requirements of section 7-5011(a)(1) of this chapter, LVU shall again provide Adequate Assurance of Performance with an Adequate Assurance Threshold Amount of zero (0) in accordance with the provisions of section 7-5011(a)(1) of this chapter. 
(4)	City (or its designee) shall calculate the Adequate Assurance of Performance for each LVU with a Contract as of each Valuation Date and City (or its designee) shall provide each LVU a statement within five (5) Business Days after such Valuation Date setting forth the Adequate Assurance Valuation Amount, the Adequate Assurance Threshold Amount, the amount of investment earnings on deposit in the relevant LVU Adequate Assurance Fund, the undrawn portion of any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Valuation Percentage, and the Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount in determining such LVU's Adequate Assurance of Performance. Within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such statement provided by City, or a third party acting on behalf of City, to an LVU under the provisions of this section 7-5011(a)(4), such LVU shall provide any additional Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount to City (or its designee) set forth in such statement so that the Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount held by City or its designee for the LVU shall meet the LVU's requirements for Adequate Assurance of Performance as of such Valuation Date. To the extent City (or its designee) as of any Valuation Date has on deposit amounts (including any investment earnings) in the relevant LVU Adequate Assurance Fund, plus any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount funded with a Letter of Credit from a Qualified Institution, in excess of Adequate Assurance of Performance for the applicable LVU, such excess shall be returned by City (or its designee) to the applicable LVU within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of the applicable statement by City to LVU. 
(5)	For each Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount provided by an LVU under this chapter, City (or its designee) shall establish a separate fund or account for such LVU (each such fund or account an "LVU Adequate Assurance Fund") within the LVU Ordinance Utility Fund. City (or its designee) shall make deposits to each LVU Adequate Assurance Fund, invest amounts therein and apply amounts thereunder consistent with the provisions of this section 7-5011. City shall not deposit, invest or apply any amounts within an LVU Adequate Assurance Fund except as provided for under the provisions of this section 7-5011. Moneys contained in each LVU Adequate Assurance Fund shall be held by City (or its designee) and shall be continuously invested and reinvested by City (or its designee) in Permitted Investments, which shall be readily convertible to cash not later than the respective dates, as estimated by City (or its designee), when the moneys in the relevant LVU Adequate Assurance Fund shall be required for the purposes intended. No such investment shall be required to be made unless the cash at the time available therefor is at least equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). City (or its designee) shall be authorized, to the extent necessary to enable City (or its designee) to apply an LVU's Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount in accordance with this section 7-5011, at any one or more times to sell any part or all of the investments on deposit in such LVU's Adequate Assurance Fund whenever it may, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, deem any such sale to be desirable. Any income derived from any profit or loss on any such investment of moneys on deposit in any such LVU Adequate Assurance Fund shall be credited or debited as the case may be, to the respective fund or account in which earned. City (or its designee) shall in no event have any liability for any loss resulting from the investment of monies in accordance with the provisions of this section 7-5011(a)(5). On each Valuation Date, City (or its designee) shall furnish LVU with a written copy of the types, amounts, yield and maturities of all such investments. Investments shall be valued by City (or its designee) as of each Valuation Date. 
(6)	With respect to an LVU which provides a Letter of Credit from a Qualified Institution as Adequate Assurance of Performance, upon the occurrence of a Letter of Credit Default, LVU shall deliver to City a substitute Letter of Credit from a Qualified Institution or cash in an amount at least equal to the stated amount of the Letter of Credit to be substituted on the first (1) Business Day after written demand by City or its designee, with failure by LVU to provide such Letter of Credit or cash to be deemed to be an Event of Default under section 7-5011(b)(vii) of this chapter. Notwithstanding any provision of the relevant Contract, the issuer of a Letter of Credit shall not be relieved of any liability it may have to any party resulting from the occurrence of a Letter of Credit Default with respect to it. 
(7)	City shall designate a Qualified Institution(s) to act as a custodian and fiduciary on behalf of City with respect to depositing, investing and/or applying Adequate Assurance Deposit Amounts in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In connection therewith, City shall Contract with such Qualified Institution(s) with respect to depositing, investing and/or applying Adequate Assurance Deposit Amounts in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)	In the event (each an "Event of Default") either City or an LVU (the "Defaulting Party") or an LVU's Guarantor shall: (i) make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (ii) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize, or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or case under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors or have such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it; (iii) otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced); (iv) be unable to pay its debts as they fall due; (v) have a receiver, provisional liquidator, conservator, custodian, trustee or other similar official appointed with respect to it or substantially all of its assets; (vi) fail to perform any obligation to the other party with respect to any Adequate Assurance of Performance relating to a Contract; (vii) with respect to LVU (or its Guarantor) only, fail to provide and maintain Adequate Assurance of Performance to City (or its designee) under a Contract as required by section 7-5011(a) of this chapter or fail to provide, replenish and/or maintain, as applicable, any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount to City (or its designee) under a Contract as required by section 7-5011(a)(1), section 7-5011(a)(2), section 7-5011(a)(3), section 7-5011(a)(4) and/or section 7-5011(a)(6) of this chapter; (viii) not have paid any amount due the other party under a Contract on or before the second Business Day following written Notice that such payment is due, including a failure by City to make a payment to LVU as permitted under the provisions of section 7-5005 of this chapter; (ix) with respect to LVU only, fail to comply with the representations and covenants set forth under Part 9 to the Local Services Agreement; (x) with respect to City only, for reasons other than (A) Force Majeure, (B) an Event of Default by LVU under this section 7-5011(b) or (C) a default by LVU under section 7-5011(f) of this chapter, fail to deliver to LVU for five (5) consecutive Days the Contract Quantity required to be delivered by City under the relevant Contract for such Days or fail to deliver to LVU under the relevant Contract more than fifty (50) percent of the Contract Quantity required to be delivered by City on any particular Day for fifteen (15) cumulative Days during any Contract Year; (xi) with respect to LVU only, for reasons other than (A) Force Majeure or (B) an Event of Default by City under this section 7-5011(b), fail to accept delivery from City for five (5) consecutive Days of the Contract Quantity required to be received by LVU under the relevant Contract for such Days, or fail to accept delivery from City of more than fifty (50) percent of the Contract Quantity required to be received by LVU under the relevant Contract on any particular Day for fifteen (15) cumulative Days during any Contract Year; or (xii) with respect to LVU (or LVU's affiliate) only, cause or permit to occur a default or Event of Default under other Contract(s) as set forth under the provisions of Part 13.12 of the Local Services Agreement, then the other party to the relevant Contract (the "Non-Defaulting Party") shall have the right, at its sole election, to immediately suspend its obligations to deliver or accept Gas upon Notice and/or to terminate and liquidate all Contracts between City and the applicable LVU then in effect in the manner provided in section 7-5011(c) of this chapter, in addition to any and all other remedies available under such Contracts; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by an LVU or an LVU's Guarantor described in this section 7-5011(b), City shall immediately withhold and/or suspend deliveries of Gas under all Contracts then in effect with the applicable LVU. 
(c)	If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right, by Notice to the Defaulting Party, to designate a Day, no earlier than the Day such Notice is given and no later than twenty (20) Days after such Notice is given, as an early termination date (the "Early Termination Date") for the liquidation and termination pursuant to section 7-5011(c)(1) of this chapter of all Contracts between City and the applicable LVU. On the early termination date, Contracts between City and the applicable LVU will terminate. 
(1)	As of the early termination date, the Non-Defaulting Party shall determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the amount owed (whether or not then due) by each party with respect to all Gas delivered and received under all Contracts between the parties on and before the early termination date and all transportation charges and other applicable charges relating to such deliveries and receipts (including without limitation any amounts owed under section 7-5006 of this chapter), for which payment has not yet been made by the party that owes such payment under the applicable Contracts. With respect to an LVU only, if the LVU or the LVU's Guarantor is the Defaulting Party, such LVU shall reimburse City for all applicable transportation fees and charges paid or to be paid by City for the right to transport the originally agreed Contract Quantity to the LVU's applicable Delivery Point as provided for under Capacity Charges under Schedule 2 attached to the ordinance from which this chapter derives under all Contracts between City and such LVU. 
(2)	The Non-Defaulting Party shall net or aggregate, as appropriate, any and all amounts owing between the parties under section 7-5011(c)(1) of this chapter, so that all such amounts are netted or aggregated to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other (the "Net Settlement Amount"). At its sole option and without prior Notice to LVU, City may setoff any Net Settlement Amount owed to City by LVU under the Contracts between the parties against any Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount held by City (or its designee) with respect to such Contracts. 
(3)	If the amount of any obligation that is to be included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to section 7-5011(c)(2) of this chapter is unascertained, the Non-Defaulting Party may in good faith estimate the amount of that obligation and net, aggregate or setoff, as applicable, in respect of the estimated amount, subject to the Non-Defaulting Party accounting to the Defaulting Party when the amount of the obligation is ascertained. Any amount not then due which is included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to section 7-5011(c)(2) of this chapter shall be discounted to net present value in a commercially reasonable manner determined by the Non-Defaulting Party. 
(d)	As soon as practicable after the early termination date, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the Net Settlement Amount, and whether the Net Settlement Amount is due to or due from the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of the Net Settlement Amount, provided that failure to give such Notice shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the termination of the Contract between City and the applicable LVU or give rise to any claim by the Defaulting Party against the Non-Defaulting Party. The Net Settlement Amount, as adjusted by any setoffs applied against such amount pursuant to section 7-5011(c)(2) of this chapter, shall be paid by the close of business on the second (2 nd ) Business Day following such Notice, which date shall not be earlier than the early termination date. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount, as adjusted by setoffs, shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lower of (i) the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two (2) percent per annum; or (ii) the maximum applicable lawful interest rate. 
(e)	The Non-Defaulting Party's remedies under this section 7-5011 are the sole and exclusive remedies of the Non-Defaulting Party with respect to the occurrence of any Event of Default under a Contract. Each party reserves to itself all other rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that it is or may be entitled to arising under the applicable Contracts. 
(f)	Upon City withholding and/or suspending deliveries of Gas under Contracts with an LVU pursuant to the provisions of section 7-5011(b) of this chapter, City thereafter shall have the right to (or cause its designee to) remarket the Gas to be delivered to the LVU under such Contracts for such period of time as City in its sole discretion may determine. In the event City takes all or any of the actions authorized by this section 7-5011(f), LVU shall remain fully liable for payment of all amounts in default and interest thereon, and shall not be relieved of any of its obligations under the Contracts, including LVU's obligation to pay amounts under section 7-5006 of this chapter with respect to Gas which City has withheld or suspended deliveries pursuant to section 7-5011(b) of this chapter which shall be Gas deemed to be delivered to such LVU and not received by LVU. If City has withheld and/or suspended deliveries of Gas under the provisions of this section 7-5011(f) and section 7-5011(b) of this chapter but has not terminated the Contracts with the applicable LVU, and such LVU subsequently cures all Events of Default by such LVU and such LVU provides Adequate Assurance of Performance with an Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount equal to the Adequate Assurance Valuation Amount and such LVU agrees to maintain Adequate Assurance of Performance for the remaining term of its Contracts with an Adequate Assurance Deposit Amount equal to the Adequate Assurance Valuation Amount, City shall, within three (3) months of City receiving Notice from LVU of all Events of Default being cured, either (A) reinstate Gas deliveries under all Contracts with such LVU or (B) exercise its right to terminate and liquidate all Contracts with such LVU in the manner provided in section 7-5011(c) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 801 , § 2, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 7-5012. - Force Majeure. 
(a)	Except with regard to City's and each LVU's obligation to make payment(s) due under section 7-5009 and/or section 7-5011 of this chapter and to pay Imbalance Charges due under section 7-5007 of this chapter, neither party to a Contract shall be liable to the other for failure to perform an obligation pursuant to section 7-5004 of this chapter to the extent such failure was caused by Force Majeure. The term "Force Majeure" as employed herein means any cause not reasonably within the control of the party claiming suspension, as further defined in section 7-5012(b) and section 7-5012(c) of this chapter. 
(b)	Force Majeure shall mean: (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption and/or curtailment of Firm transportation and/or storage by Transporters and of non-Firm transportation or storage where Firm service is not available; (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars, or acts of terror; (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy having the effect of law promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction; and (vi) any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise (but not including economic hardship or other exclusions described in section 7-5012(c)), not caused by the negligent or intentional act or omission of the party claiming suspension and which, by exercise of due diligence, such party is unable to overcome. City and each LVU shall make reasonable efforts to avoid the adverse impacts of a Force Majeure event and to resolve the impacts of an event of Force Majeure once it has occurred in order to resume performance. 
(c)	Neither party to a Contract shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Force Majeure to the extent performance is affected by any or all of the following circumstances: (i) the curtailment of interruptible or secondary Firm transportation unless primary, in-path, Firm transportation is also curtailed, or unless Firm transportation service is not available from the affected Transporter; (ii) the party claiming excuse failed to remedy the condition or its effects and to resume the performance of such covenants or obligations with reasonable dispatch; or (iii) economic hardship, to include, without limitation, City's ability to sell Gas at a higher or more advantageous price than the Ordinance Price, LVU's ability to purchase Gas at a lower or more advantageous price than the Ordinance Price, or a regulatory agency disallowing, in whole or in part, the pass through of costs resulting from a Contract; (iv) the loss of LVU's market(s) or an LVU's inability to use Gas purchased under the Contract, except, in either case, as provided in section 7-5012(b) of this chapter; or (v) the loss or failure of City's Gas supply or depletion of reserves, except, in either case, as provided in section 7-5012(b) of this chapter; or (vi) breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery within LVU's facilities, unless such incident is the result of other events listed in section 7-5012(b) of this chapter.

A party's liability under a Contract shall be limited as set forth in such provision, and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived. If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly provided for under a Contract, a party's liability under a Contract shall be limited to direct actual damages only. Such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.

The license period for the new owner or lessee covers the date of transfer or ownership or lease to December 31 of the license year. The collector shall be notified within ten (10) days when a change is effected. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1006. - Separate license required for each location, based on primary class of business. 
    Only one (1) license shall be required for each place of business, and the license shall be based upon the classification of business which constitutes the major portion of the taxable annual gross sales and receipts. However, any person operating coin vending or weighing machines shall obtain only one (1) license, regardless of the locations of the machines. However, a separate license shall be required for hotels, motels, rooming houses and boarding houses. Such license shall be in addition to the license required if other classes of business are operated in conjunction with the hotel, motel, rooming house or boarding house. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1007. - General definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly otherwise requires or unless otherwise defined in specific portions of the chapter, the following words shall have the respective meanings ascribed to each in this section: 
    Business includes any business, trade, profession, occupation, vocation, or calling. 
    Collector is the tax collector, finance officer, treasurer, city clerk or any other officer whose duty is to receive and collect the taxes and money due to each municipality or parish. 
    Contractor is synonymous with the term "builder" and means a person, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization, or a combination of them, which undertakes to or offers to undertake to, or purports to have the capacity to undertake to, or submits a bid to, or does himself or by or through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck, or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation, or other structure or works in connection therewith and includes subcontractors and specialty contractors. As such, the word, "contractor" shall include oil field service contractors, which shall consist of those contractors performing general oil well servicing, maintenance, and construction when conducted as a single company unit. "General oil well servicing" shall include welding, pipe coating, pipe inspection, wireline service, automation, workover, logging analysis, seismograph, installing and servicing equipment, packing, platform work, perforating and completion. 
    Contractor's gross receipts. For the purposes of computing the license fee provided for in this chapter, a "contractor's gross receipts" are determined the same for all contractors, whether or not they have a lump sum contract or a cost plus contract. The gross receipts for a lump sum contract are based on the actual amount of the contract, whereas, the gross receipts for a cost plus contract are based on the actual cost of the contract to the owner including the amount added thereto as a fee. 
    Gross income for real estate broker. For carrying on each business of real estate broker, the license tax shall be based on gross income. "Gross income for real estate brokers" is defined as those fees from any source deposited into the real estate broker's agency's general fund account less escrow deposits, and less fees paid to cooperating real estate brokers. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the maximum amount paid by a real estate broker shall be two thousand two hundred dollars ($2,200.00). 
    Peddler means any person who for himself or any other person, goes from house to house, or place to place, or store to store, exposing and selling the merchandise which he carries with him and delivering the same at the time of or immediately after the sale or without returning to the base of business operation between the taking of the order and the delivery of the goods; however, any person who uses the same vehicle or a combination of one (1) or more vehicles for the purpose of taking orders and delivering merchandise, regardless of the fact that the vehicle returns to the base of operations between the taking of the order and the delivery of the merchandise, shall be deemed a peddler, unless such person can show that the merchandise delivered is accompanied by an invoice or delivery ticket prepared at the base of operations and which conforms to the original order and that the person delivering the merchandise has permitted no deviation from the original order by allowing the purchaser to reject, cancel, increase, or decrease the quantity at the time of delivery or to offset against such quantity any merchandise delivered at a prior time which is being returned. 
    This extension of the meaning of the term "peddler" shall not be interpreted so as to prevent rejection or cancellation of bona fide orders or the return of inferior merchandise, but shall be construed so as to prevent persons peddling merchandise from escaping their tax liability by subterfuge through means of so-called "standing order" or blanket advance orders, increase and decrease in quantities at the time of delivery, arbitrary rejections and cancellations, and offset of merchandise returned by reason of nonsale rather than obligation of warranty, all of which are hereby declared to be mere devices to prevent normal methods of operations so as to disguise the business of a peddler as an ordinary wholesale business. Peddler shall include but is not limited to hawkers, itinerant vendors, and any retail dealers not having a fixed place of business. 
    Person includes an individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity. 
    Retail dealers to institutional consumers includes all business selling, at retail from a fixed place of business, merchandise to dairymen, cattlemen or farmers, to federal, state, parish or municipal governments or institutions, to educational or charitable institutions, to hospitals, manufacturers, public utility companies, processors, refiners, fabricators, contractors, severers of natural resources, carriers of freight or passengers, pipelines, hotels, and restaurants, provided that such sales constitute the major portion of the business. 
    Separate location exists unless a similar or associated type of business is operated as a unit under a single roof or on the same contiguous tract of land. 
    Wholesale dealer, except as specifically provided in this chapter, means any person who sells to other dealers who in turn resell. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1008. - Class of business. 
    In order to calculate the license fee for a business location at which business activities are carried on that fall under more than one tax basis schedule, gross receipts, fees, or commissions for each group of activities falling under each schedule must be compared. The rate for the schedule which constitutes the major portion of the gross receipts, fees, or commission will be used. However, the total gross receipts, fees, or commissions for all business activities carried on at the business location, minus any applicable deductions, are applicable to the schedule to compute the fee. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1009. - Period used where gross receipts are the measure of the license. 
(a)	The basis for determining the amount of the annual licenses provided by this chapter, where the license is measured by gross receipts, shall be as follows: 
(1)	If the business has been conducted previously by the same party, the annual gross receipts, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, whether received or accrued, during the preceding calendar year for which the license is issued shall be the basis for determining the amount of the annual license. 
(2)	If the business is begun during the calendar year for which the license is issued, the license for the year of commencement shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued, during the first thirty (30) days of business, multiplied by the number of months, or major fraction thereof remaining in the calendar year; however, any business which opens after June 30 of the year in question whose estimated gross receipts for the remainder of the year are less than one-half (1/2) of the maximum gross revenue allowed in the minimum rate under the classification of the particular business, shall pay for the remainder of the year at one-half (1/2) the minimum rate. 
(3)	If the business is begun less than thirty (30) days before the end of the calendar year for which the license is to be issued, the tax shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued, during the calendar year; however, one-half (1/2) of the annual rate shall apply to such businesses whose gross receipts for the period operated during the calendar year is less than one-half (1/2) of the maximum gross revenue allowed in the minimum rate under the classification of the particular business. 
(4)	The license tax of the business for the calendar year following that of commencement shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued during the previous year, divided by the number of days in operation during the year of commencement, and multiplied by three hundred sixty-five (365). 
(b)	The date of beginning business for the purposes of this chapter shall depend upon the type of business involved, and shall be governed by regulations promulgated by the collector of revenue according to law. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1010. - Taxpayers required to keep records; confidentiality. 
(a)	Generally. In general each person shall keep a reasonable record of his gross receipts, gross fees or commissions, or loans made. This record shall be kept separately for each place of business, and shall be subject to examination and inspection by the collector or his duly authorized assistants.

(1)	Except as otherwise provided by law, the records and files of the collector or the records and files maintained pursuant to a tax ordinance, excluding ad valorem property taxed and ad valorem property tax assessment rolls, of any political subdivision are confidential and privileged, and no person shall divulge or disclose any information obtained from such records and files except in the administration and enforcement of the tax laws of this state or of political subdivision of this state. 
(2)	No person shall divulge or disclose any information obtained from any examination or inspection of the premises or property of any person in connection with the administration and enforcement of the tax laws of this state or a political subdivision of this state except to the taxing jurisdiction of his employment or, in the case of an already existing independent contractor arrangement, to the contracting taxing jurisdiction. 
(3)	Neither the collector nor any employee engaged in the administration or charged with the custody of any such records or files shall be required to produce any of them for inspection or use in any action or proceeding, except in an action or proceeding in the administration or enforcement of the tax laws of this state or of a political subdivision. 
(4)	Any officer, employee, or agent or any former officer, employee, or agent of any political subdivision of the state who unlawfully discloses any information obtained from a return of a taxpayer or records and files of the collector contrary to the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) or be imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both. 
(5)	Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent such persons from disclosing a return of a taxpayer or the records of the secretary as authorized by law in any judicial proceeding in which the state or any political subdivision thereof is a party. 
(Ord. No. 433, 5-28-87) 
Sec. 10-1011. - Application for license. 
(a)	Every person subject to a license tax levied by this chapter shall apply to the collector for a license before the same becomes delinquent, as provided in this chapter. The application shall state all facts necessary to determine the amount of taxes due under this chapter.

Payment of the tax imposed by this subsection shall not be held to legalize the operation of any machine or device defined herein which is prohibited by law. This subsection shall not be held to repeal any provisions of any law prohibiting the operation, possession or use of any such machine or device. 
(5)	Evidence of payment. The payment of the taxes levied by this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of tax payment, or a stamp, or similar evidence of tax payment which shall be issued by the collector. The certificate of payment shall be securely affixed or attached to each machine or other device with respect to which a tax has been paid, or if such certificate cannot be affixed, shall be prominently posted in the place in which the machine or device is located and near to such machine or device. If a machine or device is replaced by another, such other machine or device shall not be considered an additional device service. Certificates of tax payment or stamps are not transferable from one taxing jurisdiction to another. 
(6)	Forfeitures: 
a.	Any machine or other device, on which taxes are imposed by subsection (4), which shall be found in possession or custody or within the control of any person for the purpose of being operated or permitted to be operated without having a certificate of tax payment, or a stamp or similar evidence of tax payment, issued by the collector, affixed or attached thereto, or prominently posted in the place in which the machine or device is located and near to such machine or device, may be seized by the collector of revenue, or his agent, in order to secure the same for trial, and the same shall be forfeited to the collector. The collector or his agent making the seizure shall appraise the value of the machine or other device according to his best judgment and shall deliver to the person, association of persons, firm or corporation if any, found in possession of the machine or other device, a receipt showing the fact of seizure stating from whom seized, the place of seizure, and description of the machine or the device, and appraised value and duplicate of said receipt shall be filed in the office of the collector and shall be open to public inspection. 
b.	Enforcement proceedings: 
1.	The proceeding to enforce such forfeiture shall be by rule and be in the nature of a proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction where such seizure is made. The proceeding shall be filed by the collector, or his assistant or attorney on behalf of the municipality or parish, and the same shall be summary, and it may be tried out of term time and in chambers, and shall always be tried by preference. Whenever the petition for rule shall be sworn to by the collector of revenue, or his assistant or his attorney, that the facts contained in said petition are true, and accompanied with a duplicate copy of notice of the seizure, the same shall constitute a prima facie case, but may be rebutted by the defendant. 
2.	The proceeding shall be directed against the person operating or permitting the operation of the article seized, demanding the forfeiture and sale of said property, as a penalty for the violation of this section. Service of said proceeding shall be made upon the persons operating or permitting the operation of the articles seized, demanding the forfeiture and sale of said property, as a penalty for the violation of this section. Service of said proceeding shall be made upon the person operating or permitting the operation of the seized articles if he is a resident of this state, or his residence is known to the plaintiff in rule. In all cases where it is made to appear by affidavit that the residence of the person operating or permitting the operation of the seized articles is out of the state or is unknown to the collector or his assistants or his attorney, an attorney at law shall be appointed by the courts, which has jurisdiction of the proceedings, to represent the said person operating and permitting the operation, against whom the said rule shall be tried contradictorily within ten (10) days from the date of the filing of same. The said affidavit may be made by the collector or one of his assistants, or by the attorney representing the collector, if it be not convenient to obtain the affidavit of the collector. The attorney so appointed to represent the person operating or permitting the operation of the seized articles may waive service and citation of the petition or rule, but he shall not waive time nor any legal defense. 
3.	Upon the trial of said proceedings if it is established by satisfactory proof that with respect to the articles under seizure that this section has been violated in any respect, then the court shall render judgment accordingly, maintaining the seizure, declaring the forfeiture of said seized property other than cash after ten (10) days' notice of advertisement at least twice in the official journal where the seizure is made of the machine or other device, in the parish of Orleans by the civil sheriff and in several parishes in the state by the sheriff, at public auction; it being the intent and purpose of this proceeding to afford the person operating or permitting the operation of said seized article a fair opportunity of hearing in a court of competent jurisdiction. It is further the intent and purpose of this proceeding that the forfeiture and sale of said seized property shall be and operate as a penalty for the violation of this section as aforesaid, and payment of the tax due on said seized articles at the moment of seizure or thereafter shall not operate to prevent, abate or discontinue, or defeat the said forfeiture and sale of said property. The court may fix the fee of the attorney appointed by the court to represent the owner of the seized articles at a nominal sum to be taxed as costs and to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of said property. 
c.	In cases where, in the opinion of the trial judge, the value of the seized machine or other device is so small as not to justify the expense of advertising and selling at public auction the seized commodities as hereinabove provided, the court may in any such case, in rendering judgment maintaining the seizure and declaring the forfeiture of the seized property, direct that the seized property be sold by the collector at private sale, without advertisement, but shall direct that the seized property be not thus sold for a price less than a minimum figure to be fixed by the court in its judgment. 
d.	Forfeiture of the machine or other device and its contents to the collector, as herein provided, shall not prevent any action by the collector to recover from the persons liable any taxes incurred. 
(7)	Professional sports. For each person owning or carrying on a business known as "professional sports," a license based on a flat fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) shall be required. By way of extension and not of limitation, the business of "professional sports" shall include football, basketball and baseball games, where the individual participants are paid for their services. Sporting events that are provided for by special laws are exempt under this section. 
(8)	Circuses, concerts, carnivals and special events. For each person operating a circus, carnival or other traveling show, and for each person or organization sponsoring a concert or other special event, including but not limited to gun shows, arts and crafts fairs, and antique shows, a license based on a flat fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) shall be required. This license shall be issued by the collector and shall be good for a period of ten (10) days. 
(9)	Hotels, motels, rooming houses, boarding houses. Any person operating a hotel, motel, rooming house or boarding house shall pay an annual license tax of two dollars ($2.00) for each sleeping room contained by the hotel, motel, rooming house or boarding house.

The tax levied herein shall be levied only on the business and not separately on any individual who is employed by or is a member of the taxpayer which conducts its business as a firm, partnership or corporation.

Sec. 11-1001. - Definitions. 
    In this part the terms enumerated shall have the designated meanings: 
    Another refers to any person or legal entity, including the State of Louisiana or any subdivision thereof. 
    Anything of value must be given the broadest possible construction, including any conceivable thing of the slightest value, movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, public or private. It must be construed in the broad popular sense of the phrase, and not necessarily as synonymous with the traditional legal term "property." 
    City means the City of Westlake or any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the city. 
    Dangerous weapon includes any gas, liquid or other substance or instrumentality, which, in the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm. 
    Foreseeable refers to that which ordinarily would be anticipated by a human being of average reasonable intelligence and perception. 
    Person includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not. 
    Property refers to both public and private property movable and immovable, and corporeal and incorporeal property. 
    Public officer, public office, public employee, or position of public authority, means and applies to any executive, ministerial, administrative, judicial, or legislative officer, office, employee or position of authority respectively, of the State of Louisiana or any parish, municipality, district, or other political subdivision thereof, or of any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state, parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    State means the State of Louisiana, or any parish, municipality, district, or other political subdivision thereof, or any agency, board, commission, department or institution of the state, parish, municipality, district or other political subdivision. 
    Whoever in a penalty clause refers only to natural persons insofar as imprisonment is provided, but insofar as a fine may be imposed "whoever" in a penalty clause refers to any person. 
Sec. 11-1002. - Interpretation. 
    The sections of this part cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision. 
Sec. 11-1003. - Civil remedies not affected. 
    Nothing in this part shall affect any civil remedy provided by the law pertaining to civil matters, or any legal power to inflict penalties for contempt. 
Sec. 11-1004. - Crime defined; punishment. 
(a)	A crime is that conduct which is defined as criminal in this part. 
(b)	If punishment is not specifically provided for, it shall be as provided in section 1-1008 of this Code. 
Sec. 11-1005. - Criminal conduct. 
    Criminal conduct consists of: 
(1)	An act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences, and which is combined with criminal intent; 
(2)	A mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences, where there is no requirement of criminal intent; or 
(3)	Criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. 
Sec. 11-1006. - Criminal consequences. 
    Criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this part as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein. 
Sec. 11-1007. - Criminal intent. 
    Criminal intent may be specific or general: 
(1)	Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. 
(2)	General criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent, and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender, in the ordinary course of human experience, must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act. 
Sec. 11-1008. - Criminal intent; how expressed. 
    The definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent, while in others no intent is required. Some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. However, in the absence of qualifying provisions, the terms "intent" and "intentional" have reference to "general criminal intent." 
Sec. 11-1009. - Criminal negligence. 
    Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances. 
Sec. 11-1010. - Intoxication. 
    The fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial, except as follows: 
(1)	Where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary, and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime, the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility. 
(2)	Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime. 
Sec. 11-1011. - Mistake of fact. 
    Unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime, reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime. 
Sec. 11-1012. - Mistake of law. 
    Ignorance of the provision of this part is not a defense to any criminal prosecution. However, mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow, is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances: 
(1)	Where the offender reasonably relied on an act of this municipality in repealing an existing criminal provision, or in otherwise purporting to make the offender's conduct lawful; or 
(2)	Where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional. 
Sec. 11-1013. - Justification; general provisions. 
    The fact that an offender's conduct is justifiable, although otherwise criminal, shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct. This defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances: 
(1)	When the offender's conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office; 
(2)	When the offender's conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful under the laws of the State of Louisiana or of this chapter; 
(3)	When for any reason the offender's conduct is authorized by law; 
(4)	When the offender's conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents, tutors, or teachers; 
(5)	When the crime consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility; 
(6)	When any crime is committed through the compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm, and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not committed; or 
(7)	When the offender's conduct is in defense of persons or of property under any of the circumstances described in articles 19 through 22 of the Louisiana Criminal Code. 
Sec. 11-1014. - Use of force or violence in defense. 
    The use of force or violence upon the person of another is justifiable, when committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a person's lawful possession; provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent the offense, and that this provision shall not apply where the force or violence results in a homicide. 
Sec. 11-1015. - Aggressor cannot claim self defense. 
    A person who is the aggressor or who brings on a difficulty cannot claim the right of self-defense unless he withdraws from the conflict in good faith in a manner that his adversary knows or should know that he desires to withdraw and discontinue the conflict. 
Sec. 11-1016. - Defense of others. 
    It is justifiable to use force or violence in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used those means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that the intervention is necessary to protect the other person. 
Sec. 11-1017. - Principals. 
    All persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether present or absent, and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime, are principals. 
Sec. 11-1018. - Attempt. 
(a)	Any person, who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose. 
(b)	Mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt; but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended. 
(c)	An attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended crime; and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime, although it appears on the trial that the crime intended or attempted was actually perpetrated by the person in pursuance of the attempt. 
(d)	Whosoever attempts to commit any crime shall be fined or confined, or both in the same manner as for the offense attempted; but the fine or confinement shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of the largest fine or one-half (1/2) of the longest confinement prescribed for the offense attempted or both.

(b)	The presence of any wire, cable, pipe, meter, or equipment attached thereto or any device resulting in the diversion, prevention or interference with proper action or accurate registration of such above mentioned substances constitutes prima facie evidence of knowledge and the intent to defraud by whoever has control of the room, structure or place where such device is located and who benefits from the misappropriation.

Complaints shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the mayor shall require. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the mayor shall furnish a copy of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice. Within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c), the mayor shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the mayor decides to resolve the complaint, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.

(b)	A complaint under subsection (a) shall be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. Complaints shall be in writing and shall state the facts upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.

Both complaints and answers shall be verified. 
(c)	If within thirty (30) days after a complaint filed with the mayor, the mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this article, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a complaint with the secretary of the department of housing and urban development. The mayor will assist in this filing. 
(d)	If the mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this article, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or other such affirmative action as may be appropriate.

The mayor may issue subpoenas to complete his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the district in which the investigation is taking place. The mayor may administer oaths. 
(b)	Upon written application to the mayor, a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the mayor himself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their faces the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request. 
(c)	Witnesses summoned by subpoenas of the mayor shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings in United States District Court. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him. 
(d)	Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the mayor to revoke or modify the subpoena. The mayor shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does [not] relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not described with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason. 
(e)	In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the mayor or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business. 
(f)	Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful orders of the mayor shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the mayor, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the mayor pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or be imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both.

A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or section 11-6050(d) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the mayor are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this article, and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this article shall not be affected. 
(b)	The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume such attorneys' fees.

(Ord. No. 186, 10/10/68, Art. VIII) 
Sec. 12-2009. - Board of zoning adjustment. 
(a)	Creation and appointment. A board of zoning adjustment is hereby created and established. The word "board" when used in this section shall be construed to mean the board of zoning adjustment. The board shall consist of five (5) members appointed by the mayor with the consent of the city council. Each member of the board shall be a freeholder and a qualified voter. The membership of the first board shall serve respectively, one (1) for one (1) year, one (1) for two (2) years, one (1) for three (3) years, one (1) for four (4) years, and one (1) for five (5) years.

Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. 
(b)	Organization. The board shall elect its own chairman, who shall serve for one (1) year.

(c)	Records. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings and records of its examinations and other official actions. The minutes of the board shall show the vote of each member upon each question, or, if failing to vote, indicating that fact. All minutes and records shall be filed immediately in the office of the board and shall be public records. Certified copies of all decisions of the board shall be furnished to the building inspector and the zoning commission. 
(d)	General procedure. The board shall adopt rules of procedure not in conflict with any state act or parish or municipal ordinance. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. All testimony presented at a public hearing, objections thereto, and rulings thereon shall be taken down by a reporter. In exercising its powers and duties, the board may reserve or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as should be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building inspector. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the building inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to affect any variance of an ordinance. 
(e)	Appeals . Appeals to the board may be taken by any party aggrieved, or by any officer, department, commission, board, bureau, or other agency of the incorporated area affected by any decision of the building inspector. The appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, by filing with the building inspector and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record in application or notice to the building inspector and on due cause shown. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the interested parties, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(f)	Powers and duties. The board of zoning adjustment shall have the following powers and it shall be its duty: 
(1)	To hear and decide appeals involving the interpretation of any provision of this chapter or where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)	In hearing and deciding appeals the board shall have the power to grant exceptions in the following instances: 
a.	Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single or joint ownership of record at the time the line is adopted, permit the less restricted portion of the lot to extend not more than thirty (30) feet into the more restricted portion; provided the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district; 
b.	Interpret the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the zoning district map, where the district boundaries are uncertain, or where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the district map; 
c.	Permit the erection and use of a building or the use of land for railroads or public utility purposes; 
d.	Permit unenclosed roadside stands for the sale of products raised on the premises, commercial amusements, or recreational developments for temporary or seasonal periods; 
e.	Permit temporary buildings, that are used in conjunction with construction work only, in any district during the period that construction work is in progress, but such temporary buildings shall be removed upon completion of the construction work; or 
f.	Permit land in an R-3 single-family residential district within three hundred (300) feet of a use permitted in an R-M multi-family residential district to be improved for the parking spaces required in connection with the permitted use but only when there is positive assurance that the land will be used for such purpose during the existence of the permitted use. 
    No exception shall be granted by the board of adjustment unless it finds that the use for which such exception is sought will not, in the circumstances of the particular case and under any conditions that the board considers to be necessary or desirable, be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(3)	To vary or adopt the strict application of the yard requirements or height restrictions, or parking regulations in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land in accordance with the use regulations of this chapter; to waive or reduce the parking requirements whenever the use of a building or land is so extraordinary as to make unnecessary the full provision of parking facilities, or whenever it can be shown that provision of required off street parking space within three hundred (300) feet of the main building is not feasible and would impose an unreasonable hardship as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience. 
a.	In granting any variance, the board of adjustment shall prescribe any conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable. 
b.	No variance shall be granted by the board of adjustment unless it finds: 
1.	That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings, applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to the land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood, and that the circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building. 
2.	That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land, or building and that the variance as granted by the board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose. 
3.	That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(g)	Court review. Any person or persons, or any officer, department, commission, board, bureau, or any other agency of the incorporated area jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning adjustment, may present to the Civil District Court of the Parish of Calcasieu, within thirty (30) days after filing for the decision in the office of the board, a petition asking for relief and under the rules and regulations as are provided for such matters in appropriate legislation of the State of Louisiana. 
(h)	Fees. A fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be paid to the building inspector at the time the notice of appeal is filed, which the inspector shall forthwith pay over to the city revenue department to the credit of the general revenue fund of the zoning commission.

The former Ch. 7 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 542, Arts. 1-5, adopted July 13, 1995 and Ord. No. 738 , 6-19-06. 

ARTICLE A. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 12-7001. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Louisiana has in R.S. 38:84 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of Westlake, Louisiana, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 1, 11-15-10) 
Sec. 12-7002. - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The flood hazard areas of Westlake are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 1, 11-15-10) 
Sec. 12-7003. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Protect human life and health; 
(2)	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)	Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)	Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 1, 11-15-10) 
Sec. 12-7004. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 1, 11-15-10) 
ARTICLE B. - DEFINITIONS

    Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one (1) percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year - also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(f)	Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 12-7026(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)	Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Article A, section 12-7003). 
(h)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)	Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)	Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)	Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)	Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in Article D, section 12-7027(a)-(i) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 12-7042. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section Article C, 12-7007, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)	All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.	Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.	Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)	A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Article D, section 12-7026 are satisfied. 
(4)	Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 5, 11-15-10) 
Sec. 12-7043. - Floodways. 
    Floodways. located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article C, section 12-7007, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)	Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)	If Article E, section 12-7043(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article E. 
(3)	Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 811 , Art. 5, 11-15-10) 
Sec. 12-7044. - Penalties for noncompliance.
