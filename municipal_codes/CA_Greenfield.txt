C.    Where the monthly salary is based on a forty-eight-hour work week, the hourly salary shall be twelve times the monthly salary, divided by two thousand four hundred ninety-six. (Ord. 109 §5, 1968).

2.24.060 Range numbers--Classifications--Compensation.
A.    The salary range number for each class of position shall be fixed by resolution of the city council and may be changed from time to time by resolution of the city council.

B.    When it is deemed advisable by the city council, it may, by resolution, consolidate compatible positions, in which the compensation for each such position shall be prorated in accordance with the amount of time devoted thereto by the individual as determined by resolution of the city council.

C.    The following positions shall be unclassified as to range number:

1.    City manager;

2.    City clerk;

3.    City treasurer;

4.    Building officer.

The salary or other compensation for each of the unclassified positions shall be as fixed by resolutions of the city council, and may be changed from time to time by resolution of city council.

D.    When the services required of any part-time employee are temporarily more than anticipated under normal conditions, the city council may, by resolution, adjust such salary for a period of not to exceed six months. At the end of the specified time, the salary of such employee shall revert to the appropriate rate classification.

E.    In addition to the foregoing salaries, employees may be compensated for uniforms and other items or equipment, or for necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties, in such amounts as the council from time to time determines. (Ord. 203 §1, 1978: Ord. 132 (part), 1973: Ord. 109 §6, 1968).

The hiring rate for a particular position should normally be by the first step within the applicable salary range, but if the city council deems it to be to the best interests of the city to use a higher figure in a particular case, it may by motion or resolution authorize the hiring of an employee at a higher step rate within the applicable salary range.

Every permanent full-time officer and employee of the city, whether paid a salary or daily wage, who has been such officer or employee for at least twelve full months is entitled to, and shall be allowed, up to ten working days vacation each year computed at the rate of five-sixths day per month. Following five years of eligible service, each employee shall be credited with fifteen working days; following fifteen years of eligible service, each employee shall be credited with twenty-one working days. Any further changes in vacation time will be set by resolution. Every permanent part-time officer and employee of the city whether paid a salary or daily wage, who has been such officer or employee for at least twelve full months shall be allowed vacation each year on the same basis, except that the number of days vacation time shall be proportionately reduced, so that, for example, a one-third time employee shall be allowed one-third of ten working days vacation each year and a one-half time employee shall be allowed one-half of ten working days vacation each year. When impractical for any reason to schedule any vacation within any year, vacations may be accumulated up to two years. Employees shall be paid for accumulated vacations (maximum thirty days) upon termination of employment. (Ord. 109 §9, 1968).

2.24.100 Sick leave.
Every permanent officer and employee of the city whether paid a salary or daily wage, who has been such an officer or employee for at least six full months, is entitled to, and shall be allowed one and one-quarter days sick leave with pay for each month of service up to ninety days, which time off is dependent on a bona fide illness, physical injury or physical disability. The city council may require proof thereof by a certificate of a physician or a surgeon duly licensed to practice medicine in the state of California or an affidavit or other satisfactory evidence. Five days sick leave is permitted in case of death of a relative of the first degree by blood or marriage. There shall be deducted from an employee on sick leave, or on leave for physical injury or physical disability, any sum received by such employee by way of industrial compensation. Sick leave or leave for disability or injury is not allowed when the disability results from self-inflicted sickness or injury or wilful misconduct or in the event disability is sustained while on leave of absence. When any officer or employee has not accumulated sick leave, the city council may allow such officer or employee full pay for a period of sixty days of each year for absence on account of disability occasioned by injury received while in the discharge of his or her duties as an officer or employee of the city, provided, that there shall be deducted from such payment all disability payments received by such employee under Workmen’s Compensation Act of the state of California; provided further, that pay for any such case of disability or injury received in line of duty is subject to review by the city council, and such further compensation may be awarded as the merit of the case requires and the city council determines by resolution.

This Chapter shall be known as the UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX ORDINANCE OF THE CITY. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

A.    Lodging Types: The types of lodging allowed within the city of Greenfield are hotels, motels and residence inns, which are defined as follows:

1.    "Hotel" means a facility (in one or more buildings on the same legal parcel) providing transient lodging accommodations on a daily rate for occupancy of thirty (30) or fewer days to the general public. Access is provided through a common entrance, lobby or hallway. If length of stay is extended for any reason, transient occupancy tax will be paid for all days any unit is occupied.

2.    "Motel" means a facility (in one or more buildings on the same legal parcel) providing transient lodging accommodations on a daily rate for occupancy of thirty (30) or fewer days to the general public. Access is individually and independently accessible from outside the building. Motel includes "motor lodge," "tourist court," "motor hotel," or any other designation (excepting "residence inn") intended to identify the premises as providing for rental of overnight accommodations primarily to motorists. If length of stay is extended for any reason, transient occupancy tax will be paid for all days any unit is occupied.

3.    "Hotels" and "motels" are further described as any "lodging house," "motel," "hotel," "inn" (except for the "residence inn" as defined below), "vacation home rental," "bed and breakfast," "time sharing arrangement," "recreational vehicle park" (as defined in section 17.98.020, or other place, building or structure or portion thereof maintained, advertised or otherwise held out to the public in any manner as a place where sleeping, rooming, or any other type of visitor accommodations are furnished on a transient basis (no more than thirty (30) days) composed either in whole or in part of members of the public, with or without meals. One unit for on-site manager shall be allowed, equipped with the usual residential dwelling amenities.

4.    "Residence inn" means any building or group of detached or semi-detached buildings, containing guestrooms intended or designated to be used, or which are used, rented or hired out, to be occupied, or which are occupied, for sleeping purposes by one to four (4) guests, which is also the primary residence of those guests, and which is furnished with complete kitchen and bathroom facilities. Transient occupancy tax shall be owing from any guest whose term of occupancy is thirty (30) days or less.

The three (3) definitions of "hotel," "motel," or "residence inn" set out in this section do not include any buildings, structure or property in which persons are housed or detained under legal restraint or hospitalized or otherwise under medical, nursing or psychiatric care (including but not limited to jails, hospitals, asylums, sanitariums, rest homes, orphanages, prisons, detention homes, or similar buildings where human beings are housed and detained under legal restraint).

B.    "Manager" means the person who is proprietor of any hotel, motel or residence inn, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the manager performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this Chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

C.    "Manager’s quarters" means any dwelling unit contained in any hotel, motel or residence inn meant for yearround habitation by the manager or owner of the premises.

D.    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.

E.    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

F.    "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

G.    "Tax Administrator" means the City Clerk of the City of Greenfield.

H.    "Transient" shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days or less. All portions of calendar days are counted as full days. (Ord. 501 §1, 2013; Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.030 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to, and shall pay, a tax in the amount of eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by the manager. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the manager or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the manager of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the manager of the hotel, the

Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.040 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon the following:

A.    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax herein provided;

B.    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of Federal law or international treaty;

C.    No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 386 §1. 1994).

3.28.050 Manaqer’s duties.
Each manager shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the manager. No manager of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the manager, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.060 Reqistration.
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date hereof, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each manager of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from him a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A.    The name of the manager;

B.    The address of the hotel;

C.    The date upon which the certificate was issued; and

D.    This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.070 Repairing and remitting:
Each manager shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by manager pursuant to this Chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.080 Penalties and interest.
A.    Original delinquency. A manager who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B.    Continued delinquency. Any manager who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.

C.    Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this Section.

D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any manager who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.    Penalties merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this Section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.090 Failure to collect and report tax--Determination of tax.
If any manager shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this Chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this Chapter and payable by any manager who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such manager the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the manager so assessed at his last known place of address. Such manager may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the manager for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the manager to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the manager may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.28.100. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.100 Appeal.
Any manager aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such manager at his last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive, and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every manager liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.120 Refunds.
A.    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City under this Chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections Band C of this Section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

B.    A manager may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the manager.

C.    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this Section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the manager, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the manager who collected the tax.

D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

3.28.130 Actions to collect:
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax collected by a manager which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the manager to the City. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 386 §1, 1994).

D.    If the grantor shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by grantee was without just cause, then grantor may, subject to any applicable federal or state law, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and bonds forfeited unless there is compliance by grantee within such period as grantor may fix, or may levy liquidated damages which shall be valued in 1986 dollars as follows:

Any decision by the arbitrators shall be a final judgment which may be executed upon or enforced in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The fees for the arbitrator shall be shared equally by grantor and grantee, but the costs of arbitration, which shall be the same costs which would be taxable had the dispute been brought in the superior court of Monterey County, and reasonable attorney’s fees shall be prorated among grantor and grantee in proportion to any award made by the arbitrator.

5.26.010 Definitions.
The words and phrases set out in this section, when used in this chapter, shall, for the purposes of this chapter, have the following respective meanings except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

"Hotel" means any public or private space or structure for living therein, including but not limited to any: inn, hostelry, tourist home or house, motel rooming house, mobile home or other living place within the city, offering the right to use such space for sleeping or overnight accommodations wherein the owner or operator thereof as defined in this section, for compensation, furnishes such right of occupancy to any transient as defined in this section.

"Occupancy" means the compensated use of, or the unexercised right to use, space in a hotel, as defined in this section.

"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of a hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other possessory capacity. In the event that an operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

"Person" means any nonexempt individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

"Room rental" means the total charge made by a hotel as defined in this section, for sleeping or overnight accommodations space furnished to a transient, as defined in this section. If the charge made by such hotel to any transient includes a charge in addition to that for such occupancy or right to the use of such space for sleeping or overnight accommodations, then that portion of the total charge that represents only the sleeping or overnight accommodations shall be distinctly set out and billed to the transient as a separate item.

"Transient" means any person who, for any period of not more than thirty (30) consecutive days, either at his own expense or at the expense of another, obtains the right to use space for sleeping or overnight accommodations in any hotel as defined in this section for which a charge is made therefor. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.030 Posting of rates.
Pursuant to California Civil Code section 1863, the operator of any hotel within the city shall post the room rental rates in a conspicuous location in clear view of registrants and guests. The operator shall not charge or accept money or other consideration in excess of the room rental rates required to be posted by this section. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.040 Guest receipts.
A.    Receipts: Receipts shall be issued for all cash and noncash payments at the time paid. Transient occupancy tax and any charges other than room rental charges shall be listed separately.

B.    Receipts shall be pre-numbered and in sequential order. Receipts may be in sequential order based upon date/time, when a reservation was made, or based upon date/time of registration.

C.    Room Numbers: Room numbers shall be included on all receipts, bills and registration cards, with any changes noted.

D.    Telephone Charges: Income from telephone charges is taxable and shall be reported.

E.    In the event the hotel utilizes a computerized pre-arrival registration and/or billing procedure, the hotel shall not be required to comply with subsection B of this section; provided, however, that the pre-arrival registration and/or billing procedure must be submitted to and approved by the city manager or his designee, and the hotel be able to certify that payments are properly tracked and recorded so as to create an audit trail. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.050 Guest register.
A.    The operator of any hotel shall keep a register of the names and home or business addresses of all persons to be accommodated with the length of stay indicated.

B. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section, the operator or his or her employee shall, at the time of registration, verify the identification of the registrant by requesting to see, and copying onto the registration form, any of the following: the registrant’s valid driver’s license number, the registrant’s valid passport number and country of issuance, a valid military photo identification, and/or a credit card verification of a credit card issued in the registrant’s name. The city manager or his or her designee is authorized to allow the acceptance of other forms of verification. In such a case the city manager shall notify hotel operators when and if alternate forms of verification are permitted.

2.    The operator or his or her employee must also include on the registration forms required by this subdivision the make, type and license number of the registrant’s automobile, trailer or other vehicle, and the state in which such vehicle is registered and the year of registration, for any vehicle operated by the registrant that is parked on the premises. Hotels that can demonstrate that they take sufficient reasonable steps to control access to and from parking areas on the premises shall not be required to include this information on the guest register forms.

3.    The city may develop forms for recording register information for all hotels that will conform to these requirements, and in the event that the city does develop such forms, hotels shall use such forms for maintaining the register required by subsection A of this section.

C.    In the event that the hotel utilizes a pre-arrival registration or approval procedure that obviates the requirement for an arriving guest to go to the front desk and provide information typically required as part of the hotel’s customary registration process, the hotel shall not be required to comply with subsection B of this section; provided, however, that the hotel’s pre-arrival registration or approval procedure must be submitted to and approved by the city manager or his or her designee, and the hotel must obtain such guest-related information of the type specified in subsection B of this section as the city manager might reasonably require.

(Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

Upon evidence that the operator of any hotel or transient lodging facility is not adhering to the registration requirements of section 5.26.050, or is not retaining the registers pursuant to section 5.26.060, or is not remitting the proper amount of transient occupancy tax required pursuant to Chapter 3.28, such operator shall upon notice provided by the city submit for one year copies of all guest registration information required pursuant to section 5.26.050 to the city manager or his or her designee at the time reporting and remitting of transient occupancy taxes and gross receipts is required pursuant to section 3.28.070. The time period for submitting such copies may be extended upon evidence of further violations and upon notice provided by the city. An office hearing regarding a determination by the city may be requested within five (5) days of receiving any notice pursuant to this section. The decision of the city manager is final. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.080 Registration information subject to audit.
To verify compliance with transient occupancy tax requirements as contained in chapter 3.28, the city manager or his or her designee must upon request be provided access to all guest register information required to be maintained under sections 5.26.050, 5.26.060 and 5.26.090.

5.26.090 Registration information and hotel facilities subject to inspection, review and audit.
The guest register shall at all times be open for inspection by the chief of police or his or her authorized representative.

(Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.100 Posting of identification of owner and operator.
The name, business address and business telephone number of the owner and operator must be posted in a conspicuous location in the hotel registration and/or lobby area. The owner and the operator must provide to employees of the hotel a telephone number where the owner or his or her representative may be reached during any time the hotel is in operation. Failure to post or to provide the information required in this section is punishable pursuant to section 5.26.130. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.26.110 Separate offenses.
Each violation of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 487-A §1 (Att. 1) (part), 2009).

5.28.010 Purpose and intent.
A.    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive system to control and regulate the cultivation, distribution, transport, storage, manufacturing, processing, and sale of commercial cannabis and cannabis products as allowed by and in accordance with state law and regulations.

B.    If commercial cannabis dispensary, cultivation, manufacturing, testing, distribution, transportation, and delivery activities and facilities were permitted to be established or if existing business were permitted to distribute, sell, cultivate, test, transport, or deliver cannabis, or manufacture cannabis products without appropriate regulation, such uses might be established in areas that would conflict with the requirements of the general plan, be inconsistent with surrounding uses, or be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, or the operation of such facilities may be in conflict with applicable state law and regulations. The city council desires to enact reasonable regulations pertaining to cannabis dispensary, cultivation, manufacturing, testing, distribution, transportation, and delivery facilities to ensure that such uses do not conflict with the general plan, are not inconsistent with surrounding uses, and are not detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, and the operation of such facilities is in compliance with applicable state law and regulations.

To the extent any provision of this chapter conflicts with or contradicts any applicable state law or regulation, or establishes a criterion, procedure, standard, requirement, or regulation that does not meet the minimum standards of any applicable state law or regulation, the requirements of the applicable state law or regulation shall take precedence. To the extent any provision of this chapter imposes a criterion, procedure, standard, requirement, or regulation that is more restrictive than that imposed by any applicable state law or regulation, the more restrictive provisions of this chapter shall take precedence, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable state law or regulation. The city manager or designee shall make interpretations and determinations under this subsection for consistency with all applicable state laws and regulations, subject to the appeal procedures of section 5.28.290.

E.    The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted and applied to avoid conflict with any other provision of this chapter. The city manager or designee shall make interpretations under this chapter to avoid any such conflict. If the city manager or designee is unable to make a good faith interpretation to avoid any such conflict, the city manager or designee shall make a determination as to which conflicting provision shall take precedence and shall report such determination to the city council.

Chapter 6.14
VICIOUS OR UNSAFE ANIMALS
Sections:

6.14.010    Vicious or unsafe animals.

6.14.020    Keeping of unconfined vicious animal unlawful and a public nuisance.

6.14.030    Impoundment of vicious animals.

6.14.040    Confinement or destruction of vicious animals.

6.14.010 Vicious or unsafe animals.
For the purposes of this chapter, a "vicious or unsafe animal" is one having a known propensity or disposition to attack a human or animal without provocation, or one owned and maintained for the purpose of participating in dog fights. It shall be presumed that an animal is vicious and unsafe when records of the animal control officer indicate that it has, without provocation, attacked a person when such person is conducting himself or herself peacefully and lawfully, or when it has, without provocation, attacked another animal on property other than that of its owner. For purposes of this section, a person on the private property of the owner of an animal is deemed to be conducting himself or herself peacefully and lawfully when he or she is present on said property in the performance of a duty imposed on such person by state or local law or by the postal laws or regulations of the United States, or when he or she is on such property at the invitation, express or implied, of the owner.

No dog shall be declared potentially dangerous or vicious pursuant to this chapter if it causes any injury or damage which is sustained by a person who, at the time of the injury or the damage, was committing a willful trespass or other violation upon premises occupied by the owner or the keeper of the dog, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. No dog shall be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the dog was protecting or defending a person in the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. No dog may be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if an injury was sustained by a domestic animal which, at the time the injury or the damage was sustained, was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog.

No dog shall be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the injury or damage to a domestic animal was sustained while the dog was working as a hunting dog, herding dog or predator control dog on the property of, or under the control of, its owner or keeper, and the damage or the injury was to a species or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the dog. (Ord. 531 Exh. A(part), 2018: Ord. 325 §3(part), 1987).

6.14.020 Keeping of unconfined vicious animal unlawful and a public nuisance.
Except when confined as provided in section 6.14.040, the keeping of a vicious or unsafe animal is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. Whenever the animal control officer has reason to believe that any animal is vicious or unsafe, he may issue an order directing the owner of such animal to abate such nuisance by disposing of the animal or by adequately confining the animal as provided in section 6.14.040. If the owner of such an animal, for any reason whatsoever, fails to comply with the order of the animal control officer, the animal control officer may issue an order directing the owner to appear at a hearing to show cause why he or she should not be required to surrender said animal to the animal control officer or take such other steps as may be designated to abate such nuisance. Notice of the time and place of said hearing, and of the designated action, shall be served upon the owner of said animal, either personally or by registered or certified mail addressed to said owner at his or her last-known address, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing. The city manager, or his designated representative, shall act as hearing officer at such a hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer may order the animal to be surrendered and destroyed, or may order such other measures as in his judgment are necessary to abate the nuisance. (Ord. 531 Exh. A(part), 2018: Ord. 325 §3(part), 1987).

6.14.030 Impoundment of vicious animals.
A.    Whenever the animal control officer has reasonable cause to believe that an unconfined animal is vicious or unsafe and that it constitutes an immediate hazard to persons, the animal control officer may immediately seize the animal. If the animal control officer is unable to locate the owner, or if the owner is unable or unwilling to take the necessary steps to confine such animal in the manner provided in section 6.14.040, the animal control officer may immediately impound the animal. Such animal shall be returned to its owner only if the animal control officer is satisfied that the owner will confine such animal as provided in section 6.14.040. If the owner fails or refuses to make such arrangements for the confinement of the animal, or if the owner cannot be located after reasonable effort to do so has been made, the animal control officer may order the animal to be destroyed, or he may take such lesser measures as, under the circumstances, he deems necessary to protect persons from injury. In the event a vicious or unsafe animal cannot be safely impounded under the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the animal control officer or a police officer may enter upon any premises where such animal is kept or found and slay such animal.

B.    It shall be unlawful for the owner of any animal to fail or refuse to comply with any order issued under this section by the animal control officer. Each additional day that the owner continues to disobey such order shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of this section.

C.    A keeping charge as provided in section 6.16.030 shall be assessed for each day during which the animal is impounded under the provisions of this section and such animal shall not be released until the owner pays all such charges. (Ord. 531 Exh. A(part), 2018: Ord. 325 §3(part), 1987).

6.14.040 Confinement or destruction of vicious animals.
Every vicious or unsafe animal must at all times be confined indoors or in a securely locked pen or kennel, except when it is securely leashed and under the physical control of a person holding the leash; such animals shall not be leashed or tied to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, or buildings.

The city council finds and declares:

A.    Purpose.

1.    The purpose of this chapter is to provide a continuing source of current information concerning hazardous substances and chemicals being utilized in the city to protect the general health and safety of the public and to enable emergency personnel to respond safely and speedily to emergency situations which may arise.

2.    The city council declares that it is in the public interest to establish a continuing program for the purpose of preventing contamination from, and improper storage of, hazardous substances stored underground. It is the intent of the city council in enacting this chapter to establish orderly procedures that will ensure that newly constructed underground storage tanks meet appropriate standards and that existing tanks be properly maintained, inspected, and tested so that the health, property, and resources of the people of the city will be protected.

B.    Findings.

1.    Essential information on the location, type, quantity and health risks of hazardous materials used, stored, or disposed of in the city is not now available to fire fighters, health officials, health care providers, law enforcement agencies and emergency communications officers.

2.    Hazardous substance and chemical information disclosure is necessary so that the city and other affected public agencies may respond effectively to fire or other emergency involving materials that exhibit hazardous characteristics and may pose hazards to the community.

8.48.010 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Greenfield does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.020 Findings of fact.
A.    The flood hazard areas of the city of Greenfield are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B.    These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide [i.e., mudflow] or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

A.    Protect human life and health;

B.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C.    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E.    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

G.    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H.    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

A.    Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B.    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C.    Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D.    Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.050 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

1.    Solely for the parking of no more than two (2) cars; or

2.    A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) in value.

"Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

"Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone- or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

"Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

"Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter.

"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one (1’) to three feet (3’); a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

Area of special flood hazard. See "Special flood hazard area."

"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). "Base flood" is the term used throughout this chapter.

"Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for Zones AE, AH, A1--30, VE and V1--V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade, i.e., below ground level, on all sides.

Building. See "Structure."

"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 26, 2009.

"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

"Flood, flooding, or flood water" means:

1.    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

2.    The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding."

"Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1'). Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

"Fraud and victimization" as related to sections 8.48.230 through 8.48.250, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city of Greenfield will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.120 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.130 Designation of the floodplain administrator.
The community development director is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.140 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

A.    Permit Review: Review all development permits to determine:

1.    Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

2.    All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

3.    The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4.    The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the city of Greenfield; and

5.    All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.

B.    Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures:

1.    Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value."

2.    Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

C.    Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data:

When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 8.48.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer sections 8.48.170 through 8.48.220.

NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas--A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995.

D.    Notification of Other Agencies:

1.    Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

a.    Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

b.    Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

c.    Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

2.    Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:

a.    Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

b.    All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

3.    Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

E.    Documentation of Floodplain Development: Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

1.    Certification required by subsection 8.48.170C1 and section 8.48.200 (lowest floor elevations);

2.    Certification required by subsection 8.48.170C2 (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);

3.    Certification required by subsection 8.48.170C3 (wet floodproofing standard);

4.    Certification of elevation required by subsection 8.48.190A3 (subdivisions and other proposed development standards);

5.    Certification required by subsection 8.48.220B (floodway encroachments); and

6.    Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

F.    Map Determination: Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in section 8.48.160.

G.    Remedial Action: Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in section 8.48.080.

H.    Biennial Report: Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA.

C.    Meet the permit requirements of section 8.48.150 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in section 8.48.200A. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.220 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A.    Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1--30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the city of Greenfield.

B.    Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Greenfield shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

C.    If subsections A and B of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 8.48.170 through this section. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.230 Nature of variances.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city of Greenfield to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.240 Conditions for variances.
A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of sections 8.48.130 through 8.48.220 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B.    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in section 8.48.050) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C.    Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

E.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1.    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and

2.    Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Monterey County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F.    The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.48.250 Appeals board.
A.    In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

1.    Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4.    Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.    Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.    Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11.    Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B.    Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1.    Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2.    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3.    Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

C.    Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

D.    Upon consideration of the factors of section 8.48.240A and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 486 §1(part), 2009).

8.52.070    Effective date.

8.52.010 Purpose and intent.
The use of single-use carryout bags at retail establishments is detrimental to the environment and the public health and welfare. The manufacture and distribution of single-use carryout bags requires utilization of natural resources and results in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions. Single-use carryout bags contribute to environmental problems, including litter in storm drains, creeks, the bay and the ocean. Single-use carryout bags provided by retail establishments impose unseen costs on consumers, local governments, the state and taxpayers and constitute a public nuisance. Prohibiting retail establishments from using plastic single-use carryout bags and requiring a fee for paper bags reduces litter and benefits the environment by encouraging customers to use reusable bags. The regulations and requirements set forth in this chapter are intended to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, reduce the consumption of natural resources and the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, protect the environment, and reduce litter in the community. (Ord. 505 §1(part), 2014).

9.38.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Ordinance Governing Removal of Graffiti and Other Similar Inscribed Material." (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.020 Purpose.
In order to reduce blight and deterioration within the city, it is the intent of this chapter to provide an immediate and practical method (in addition to any existing remedies available at law) for eradication and prevention of graffiti from all structures located either on public or privately owned real property. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.030 Findings.
A.    The city council finds and determines that graffiti constitutes an obnoxious public nuisance.

B.    The city council further finds and determines that such defacement tends to decrease property values and lessen the ability to quietly enjoy other properties adjacent to or near graffiti-inscribed structures, causes the lessening of property values and diminution of life quality to innocent persons, that a substantial proportion of graffiti defacement is related to delinquency problems and graffiti often excites in persons of reasonable sensitivity feelings of hate, aversion, aggravation, distaste, repugnance or disgust.

C.    Prompt removal of graffiti will help to alleviate the adverse social and economic impacts which graffiti has caused within the city. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

"Reward" means an authorized payment of monetary compensation to a person or persons for information received by the city leading to the determination of the identity and the apprehension of a person or persons whose wilful misconduct has resulted in or has wilfully damaged or destroyed any property through the placement of graffiti or similar inscribed materials.

This use shall comply with Section 32060 of the Education Code regarding the safe use of toxic art supplies in schools. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.070 Display of marker pens and aerosol paint containers.
A.    It is unlawful for any person or persons, firm or corporation doing business in the city to display aerosol paint containers or marker pens with a felt tip writing surface of one-half inch or greater (containing anything other than a solution removable with water after it dries) in an area other than an enclosed, locked and secured counter or display area or which is otherwise not made available to the public except upon request.

(Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.100 Manner of cleaning:
Any person(s) owning lots, the director or contractor, as the case may be, shall remove the graffiti and return the surface of the damaged structure to its condition as it existed prior to the graffiti. This section may not be construed, however, to allow continuing existence of a substandard or nonconforming structure to be made further substandard or nonconforming by removal of graffiti. Any such permits or repairs necessary to maintain the integrity of the building will be required as the responsibility of the property owner to maintain a safe and properly constructed structure. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

Painting or repair of an area more extensive than is necessary to provide a uniform appearance is prohibited.

B.    In the case a property owner is willing to allow the city to remove the graffiti, agreeing to reimburse the city for that removal, prior to city removal of the graffiti, written consent from the owner of the affected structures, public or private, must be obtained. The consent shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and shall:

1.    Authorize entry of city employees and/or contractors on the affected property to accomplish the removal of the material;

2.    Assign to the city any cause or causes of action which the owner may have against any person or persons who defaced said property with graffiti; and

3.    Hold the city, its officers, councilpersons, employees and contractors harmless from all liability arising out of the entry on the property or the work of removing the graffiti.

4.    Agrees to pay all costs of removal of the graffiti as outlined in the director’s report to the council outlining the work done and the costs for that work. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.120 Recording notice of pendency and completion of proceedings.
A.    If, after the property owner or authorized agent is notified of the presence of graffiti on a subject property in accordance with the notification procedures described in this chapter and does not remove the graffiti (or show good faith effort toward that removal), the city shall proceed with removal, recording a notice as described below to assign all costs of that removal to the property owner and recording a notice of pendency of graffiti abatement proceedings on the subject property.

B.    Prior to any graffiti abatement work by the city or by any person(s) under contract with the city, the director shall cause to be recorded in the Monterey County recorder’s office, a notice of pendency of graffiti abatement proceedings by the city against the parcel involved.

The notice of completion of graffiti abatement proceedings shall, when recorded, conclusively establish that graffiti abatement proceedings have been completed, all necessary charges for that abatement incurred by the city have been paid and shall extinguish the notice of pendency of graffiti abatement proceedings previously recorded. The pendency notice shall specify:

1.    Name of the current owner(s) of the parcel as shown on Monterey County’s last equalized assessment roll;

2.    Date of recordation, book and page number of Monterey County’s Official Records at which the ownership records of such owner(s) are shown as recorded;

3.    Monterey County assessor’s parcel number(s) for the parcels involved;

4.    Street address, as well as any other information necessary to facilitate recordation and convey notice of the pendency or completion of graffiti abatement proceedings. (Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.38.130 Meeting of council to approve costs of removal by city.
A.    The council or the code enforcement board shall conduct a hearing upon the report submitted by the director to hear all protests and objections to the report, the work done and the costs for that work. At least ten (10) days in advance of such hearing, the city clerk shall notify the person(s) owning property upon which work was performed (under section 9.38.110) of the date, time and place of the council hearing and the total cost to be charged against the property. The total cost shall include such charges as the council or code enforcement board, by resolution, has determined for administrative expenses connected with the removal of graffiti and collection of costs for removal.

The council or code enforcement board shall, after the hearing as provided for in section 9.38.130, send the confirmed report to the director of finance with instructions to bill the property owner(s) to collect the total costs of removal. If costs are not paid, the city treasurer shall have the costs entered under an appropriate heading upon the assessment roll for collection at the time and in the manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, subject to the same penalties and procedures under foreclosure for sale and in case of delinquency as provided for in ordinary municipal taxes. If costs are not paid, the council may, by resolution, order that all costs of removal constitute liens upon the property, directing the director of finance to record a certified copy of such resolution in the Monterey County recorder’s office. The city attorney may thereupon proceed to foreclose each of such liens and to collect all amounts owing to the city in the manner provided by law, or bring suit to enforce recovery of said costs as provided in section 9.38.180. (Ord. 500 §3, 2013: Ord. 379 §1(part), 1994).

9.40.010 Purpose and findings.
It is the purpose and intent of the city council of the city of Greenfield, through the adoption of this chapter, to establish an abandoned and distressed residential property registration program as a mechanism to protect residential neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of abandoned properties and to establish uniform and reasonable regulations to prevent immediate risk and detrimental effects associated with abandoned and distressed properties.

The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that abandoned and distressed residential properties pose risk to the public peace, health and safety of citizens in that the detrimental effects from the lack of security and maintenance of abandoned and distressed residential properties endanger children unprotected from unsecured pools and other attractive nuisances, lead to neighborhood decline, contribute to lower property values, discourage potential buyers from purchasing a home adjacent to or in the neighborhoods with abandoned and distressed residences, and further endanger neighborhoods affected by the resulting squatting, vandalism, burglaries and other crimes.

The city council of the city of Greenfield further finds that the city will incur additional costs in administering and implementing the abandoned and distressed residential properties registration program and that it is in the best interests of the public for the city to recover the said costs through imposition of a registration fee. (Ord. 484 §1(part), 2008).

In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the city council of the city hereby makes the following findings and declarations:

A.    The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, is found:

1.    To create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property,

3.    To invite plundering,

4.    To create fire hazards,

5.    To constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors,

6.    To create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare.

B.    Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 131 §1(part), 1973).

B.    A vehicle or part thereof which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, a junk dealer, or when such storage or parking is necessary to the operation of a lawfully conducted business or commercial enterprise. Nothing in this section shall authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance as defined under provisions of the law other than Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 22650) of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code and this chapter. (Ord. 131 §2, 1973).

10.16.040 Nonexclusive remedy.
This chapter is not the exclusive regulation of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles within the city.

(Ord. 131 §3, 1973).

10.16.050 Enforcement by director of planning:

A.    Notice of intention to abate and remove a vehiole or part thereof as a public nuisance shall be given to the registered and legal owner of the vehicle and to the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located at least ten days before such abatement and removal. Such notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the vehicle and of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and the name of the registered and legal owner or owners of the vehicle.

B.    The statement shall present to the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land with his reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing.

C.

If the owner of land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such time period, this statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. If such a request is not received within such period, the director of planning, his deputies, assistants, or employees have the authority to remove the vehicle, and in such cases the city council shall assess administrative and removal costs. (Ord. 131 §8(part), 1973).

The code enforcement board may impose such conditions and take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter.

The insurance specified in this section shall be carried by the permittee at his sole cost and expense, shall name city as additional insured, and shall remain in effect until all work required to be performed under the terms of the encroachment permit is satisfactorily completed. The city manager may require such certification as he deems necessary to substantiate the insurance coverage of the permittee prior to the issuance of the encroachment permit. Each permit shall be construed as authorizing merely the temporary privilege to encroach to the extent permitted and subject to the conditions therein stated. No permit shall be deemed to transfer any right, title or interest of the city. The city may cancel a permit at any time and thereby terminate encroachment privileges. Permits for canopies, fences, and railings required by Section 4406 of the Uniform Building Code shall automatically expire when the construction permit expires or is cancelled.

If a service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of fifty percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than fifty dollars. The penalty shall become part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 361 §1(Exh. A(part)), 1991).

13.50.140 Recordkeeping reguirements.

A.    Chapter 1, with the exception of Section 101, is deleted.

B.    All of the appendices, with the exception of the following Appendices or portions thereof, are deleted:

1.    2007 CBC Appendix Chapter 1.

2.    2007 CBC Appendix C.

3.    2007 CBC Appendix J, except Section J110.1 shall be amended as follows:

General. Buildings and access envelopes shall be delineated on the development plans when necessary to keep disturbance out of particularly erodible areas. Exposed soil shall be protected from erosion by temporary and/or permanent measures. Such protection may consist of mulching, plastic sheeting, and/or vegetation.

Runoff Control. Where concentrated runoff will occur, it will be carried in pipe or culvert conduits or over a nonerodible surface (paved, rocked or vegetated) to a catchment basin clearly shown on the development plan. All conduits must have proper energy dissipaters at the point of discharge when necessary to prevent erosion.

Building Site Runoff. Runoff from the building site shall be controlled by berms, swales, ditches, structures, vegetable filter strips and/or catch basins to prevent the escape of sediment from the site. At least one percent (1%) grade will be required toward an improved storm drainage or catch basin facility, either existing or planned.

Runoff Retention. Permanent holding of runoff on the site through percolation to the ground shall be required during and after construction, by the use of catch basins, retention grading, pavement collection and recharge systems and/or individual systems for housing units such as drywells and cisterns.

Topsoil. To promote regrowth of vegetation, the topsoil shall be stockpiled and reapplied upon completion of the grading on slopes of less than 5:1 (20%).

Soil Placement and Disposal. The placing or disposal of soil, silt or other organic and earthen materials from construction and other soil-disturbance activities at locations above the anticipated high water line of any stream in the basin where they may be washed into said waters by rainfall or runoff in quantities deleterious to fish, wildlife and other beneficial uses, is prohibited.

Temporary Vegetation. Temporary vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil as permanent vegetation cover is maturing shall be established on all disturbed areas as needed and as each stage of grading is completed.

Winter Operations. (October 15th to April 15th)

1.    Land disturbances or development operations may be restricted or temporarily halted between October 15th and April 15th (the normal rain season) and/or other times whenever the Building Official determines that the weather, soil, slope and general site conditions may cause serious accelerated erosion or sediment damage either on-site or downstream. When work is allowed, native ground cover shall not be cleared, destroyed, burned, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to grading or construction work unless approved in advance by the Building Official.

2.    When land development work is allowed during the normal rain season, adequate erosion and sediment control measures including sediment catch basins must be in place and effective during any land disturbance.

3.    All cut and fill slopes without established vegetation between October 15th and April 15th shall be mulched. The mulching shall be anchored by punching or tacking into the soil or by use of netting. A minimum of 1,000 pounds of straw, or equivalent, per each 10,000 square feet of slope surface will be required to be anchored. An additional amount may be required by the Building Official.

Dust. Dust from grading operations must be controlled. The permittee may be required to keep adequate equipment on the grading site to prevent dust problems.

Erosion Control Coordination with Project Installation.

1.    All vegetation and/or structural measures required to safely discharge any accelerated runoff generated by the project shall be installed during the first or initial construction phase of the project.

2.    Land shall be developed in increments of workable size which can be completed in a single construction season. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be coordinated with a sequence of grading, development and construction operations and all necessary erosion control measures shall be put in effect to the commencement of the next work increment and/or winter rain season.

3.    Prior to completion and final acceptance of the project, all erosion control measures must be in place and all exposed bare soil shall be mulched, fertilized and otherwise prepared so that it is planted to a permanent vegetative cover. The Building Official may require watering of planted areas to initiate and assure growth.

Existing Major Developments. As part of an expansion or intensification of existing major developments, silt and grease traps or sediment catch basins shall be required.

Maintenance. All on-site erosion control facilities shall be properly maintained by the owners for the life of the project so that they do not become nuisances with stagnant water, heavy algae growth, insect breeding, odors, discharged debris and/or safety hazards. Vegetative maintenance required may include mowing, fertilizations, irrigation and/or reseeding.

15.20.070 Preliminary investigation by engineer:
Where the building official is unable to determine whether or not a building is of URM construction, the building official shall serve upon the owner of the building a written notice and order requiring the owner to employ an engineer, licensed to practice in the state of California, to conduct a preliminary investigation of the building for the purpose of determining whether or not the building is, in fact, of URM construction. The notice and order may be served personally or by mail, addressed to the owner at the address shown upon the latest equalized assessment roll. Within six months after the date of service of said notice and order the owner shall file with the building official the written report of the engineer stating his findings as to whether or not the building is of URM construction. (Ord. 344 §1(part), 1989).

15.20.080 Investigation and engineering report:
Where a building has been identified by the building official, or by the engineer conducting a preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 15.20.070 of this chapter, as being of URM construction or otherwise potentially hazardous to life in the event of an earthquake, the building official shall serve upon the owner of the building a written notice and order requiring the owner to employ an engineer, licensed to practice in the state of California, to make a full and comprehensive investigation and engineering report as to the condition of the building which will serve as a sound basis for a conclusion as to whether or not the building is potentially hazardous to life in the event of an earthquake. The investigation and engineering report shall contain the following:

A.    General Information. A description of the building including:

1.    The street address; also, a legal description and assessor’s parcel number for the property on which the building is located;

SMALL RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM REVIEW PROCESS
Sections:

15.28.010    Purpose and intent.

15.28.020    Definitions.

15.28.030    Solar energy system permit.

15.28.010 Purpose and intent.
A.    The California Legislature has declared that implementation of consistent statewide standards to achieve the timely and cost-effective installation of solar energy systems is a matter of statewide concern. It is the policy of the state to promote and encourage the use of solar energy systems and to limit obstacles to their use. It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies not adopt ordinances that create unreasonable barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, including, but not limited to, design review for aesthetic purposes, and not unreasonably restrict the ability of homeowners and agricultural and business concerns to install solar energy systems. It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies comply not only with the language of Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code, but also encourage the installation of solar energy systems by removing obstacles to, and minimizing costs of, permitting for such systems.

B.    It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies shall administratively approve applications to install solar energy systems through the issuance of a building permit or similar nondiscretionary permit. Review of the application to install a solar energy system shall be limited to the local agency’s building official’s review of whether it meets all health and safety requirements of local, state, and federal law. The Legislature has further declared that requirements of local law shall be limited to those standards and regulations necessary to ensure that the solar energy system will not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. (Ord. 513 §1(part), 2015).

15.28.020 Definitions.
A.    The following words and phrases as used in this section are defined as follows:

1.    "Electronic submittal" means the utilization of one or more of the following:

a.    E-mail;

b.    The Internet; or

c.    Facsimile.

2.    "Small residential rooftop solar energy system" means all of the following:

a.    A solar energy system that is no larger than ten (10) kilowatts alternating current nameplate rating or thirty (30) kilowatts thermal;

b.    A solar energy system that conforms to all applicable state fire, structural, electrical, and other building codes as adopted or amended by the city and paragraph (iii) of subdivision (c) of Section 714 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time;

c.    A solar energy system that is installed on a single or duplex family dwelling; and

d.    A solar panel or module array that does not exceed the maximum legal building height as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

3.    "Solar energy system" has the same meaning set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 801.5 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time. (Ord. 513 §1(part), 2015).

15.28.030 Solar energy system permit.
A.    A building permit is required for all solar energy system installations.

B.    Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in developing an expedited solar energy system permitting process, the city shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The building official shall develop and adopt such checklist.

C.    The checklist shall be published on the city’s Internet website. The applicant for a small rooftop solar energy system may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the city’s building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications, and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature.

D.    Prior to submitting an application for a building permit, the applicant shall:

1.    At the applicant’s cost, verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and

2.    At the applicant’s cost, verify to the applicant’s reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system’s current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads.

E.    An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the building official, shall be deemed complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance.

F.    Subject to subsection G of this section, upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the building official shall administratively approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local utility provider’s electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider.

G.    The building official shall not approve the application and shall not issue a building permit if the building official makes a finding, based on substantial evidence, that the solar energy system will have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety. The decision of the building official to deny a building permit pursuant to this subsection may be appealed by the applicant to the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of section 17.14.060.

H.    For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and fire chief, except that a separate fire inspection may be performed if the city and the local fire authority do not have an agreement in place authorizing the building official to conduct a fire safety inspection on behalf of the fire authority. If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however, the subsequent inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection. (Ord. 513 §1(part), 2015).

Such fee shall be used for a local park which bears a reasonable relationship to the present and future needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision, as determined by the planning commission and the city council.

E.    Criteria For Requiring Both Land Dedication And In Lieu Fees: In subdivisions of fifty (50) or more parcels, the subdivider may, in the discretion of the city council, be required to dedicate land and pay in lieu fees in accordance with the following:

When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on a master park and recreation plan, adopted as an element of the general plan of the city, as the site for a local park or recreational facility, such portion shall be dedicated for local park and recreation purposes and a fee shall be paid equal to the fair market value of any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection C of this section, as determined by an appraiser acceptable to the city, plus twenty percent for off-site improvements.

2.    When a major portion of such proposed park or recreational facility site has already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land within the subdivision is needed to complete the same, such portion within the subdivision shall be dedicated and, in addition, a fee shall be paid in an amount equal to the fair market value of the remaining land which otherwise would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection C of this section, as determined by an appraiser acceptable to the city, plus twenty percent for off-site improvements.

A.    Improved design based on density control and better community environment: The standards set out in Chapters 16.12 and 16.20 and this section may be varied only when gross density of an area is not increased more than ten percent, and where said design has the approval of the planning commission, and where in the opinion of the planning commission (or on appeal to the city council) said deviation will:

1.    Produce a more desirable and livable community than the minimum requirements herein,

2.    Create better community environment through dedication of public areas, or setting out permanent scenic easements or open spaces; rearrangement of lot sizes, reforestation of barren areas,

3.    Reduce the danger of erosion,

4.    Reduce the area and unsightliness of cut and fill banks.

B.    As an incentive to creating better overall communities, the planning commission may authorize reduction in lot size but with no mote than ten percent increase in density in the overall development. The planning commission may authorize similar deviations from other standards herein, where said deviations are for the purposes outlined above.

C.    Before any deviation based on improved design shall be authorized, it shall be passed by not less than a twothirds vote of the total membership of the planning commission, upon a finding that the variation as authorized will result in a community which is a substantial improvement over the community which could have been developed by following the requirements set out in Chapters 16.12 and 16.20. (Ord. 98 §9, 1966).

16.36.060 Street design.
Street design shall conform to engineering standards of the city. (Ord. 180 §5, 1975: Ord. 98 §10(part), 1966).

16.36.070 Fees.
Fees may be required as a condition of approval of the final subdivision map or as a condition of issuing building permits for the purpose of defraying actual or estimated costs of constructing bridges or major thoroughfares when such bridges or major thoroughfares are indicated in the circulation element of the general plan and, in the case of bridges, the flood control provisions thereof which identify streams for which bridge crossings are required on the general plan for roads. Prior to the requirement of such fees there wi 11 be a public hearing held by the city council for each area benefited. Notice of such hearing shall be given as set forth in Section 66484(b) of the Government Code. Such notice shall contain preliminary information related to the boundaries of the area of benefit, estimated cost and the method of fee apportionment. At said public hearing the boundaries of the area of benefit, the costs, whether actual or estimated, and a fair method of fee apportionment shall be established, as provided in Section 66484(c) of the Government Code. Payment of such fees shall not be required unless the planned bridge facility or major thoroughfares are in addition to, or a reconstruction of, any existing bridge facilities or major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit. If, prior to the time of such public hearing, there is a written protest filed with the city clerk by the owners of more than onehalf of the area to be benefited by the improvement, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned and the city council shall not, for one year from the filing of such written protest, commence or carryon any proceedings for the same improvement or acquisition under the provisions of this title. Protests may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time of such public hearing by filing with the city clerk a written statement of withdrawal. (Ord. 180 §5, 1975: Ord. 98 §10, 1966)

This title is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of residents and businesses in the city.

17.02.020 Authority.
A.    This title is enacted based on the authority vested in the city of Greenfield by the state of California, including, but not limited to, Article XI, Section 7 of the state constitution; the planning and zoning law (California Government Code Section 65000 et seq.); the subdivision map act (California Government Code Section 66410 et seq.); and the California Environmental Quality Act (California Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.).

4.    Establish requirements for off-street parking and loading;

5.    Establish and maintain building setback lines;

6.    Create civic districts around civic centers, public parks, public buildings, or public grounds, and establish regulations for those civic districts; and

7.    Require, as a condition of the development of residential rental units, that the development include a certain percentage of residential rental units affordable to, and occupied by, households with incomes that do not exceed the limits for moderate-, low-, very low-, or extremely low-income households specified in Sections 50079.5, 50093, 50105, and 50106 of the California Health and Safety Code. The ordinance shall provide alternative means of compliance that may include, but are not limited to, in-lieu fees, land dedication, off-site construction, or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units.

C.    California Government Code Section 65851 authorizes the legislative body of a city to divide the city, or portions thereof, into zones of the number, shape, and area it deems best suited to carry out the purpose of Chapter 4, Zoning Regulations, commencing with Section 65800 of the California Government Code.

D.    California Government Code Section 65852 mandates that all such zoning regulations be uniform for each class or kind of building or use of land throughout each zone, but the regulation in one type of zone may differ from those in other types of zones. (Ord. 533 §2(part), 2018: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.02.030 Discrimination Prohibited.

3.    The intended occupancy of any residential development by persons or families of very low, low, moderate, or middle income.

B.    The enactment or administration of this title shall not prohibit or discriminate against any residential development or emergency shelter because of any of the characteristics of an individual or group of individuals listed in subsection A of this section, or because the development consists of a multifamily residential project that is consistent with both this title and the city’s general plan.

C.    A housing development project may not be disapproved or subject to conditional approval in a manner that renders the project infeasible if the basis for the disapproval or conditional approval includes any of the reasons prohibited in subsection A of this section.

D.    A housing development whose intended occupants include any individuals or group of individuals with any of the characteristics listed in subsection A of this section, or are persons or families of very low, low, moderate, or middle income, may not be subject to different requirements than those imposed on developments generally.

17.16.010 Permit Requirements And Exemptions:
All planning and zoning related permits and actions required and regulated by the city are listed herein. Such permits generally fall into three (3) categories based on the type of permit or action and the level of review:

A.    Administrative permits and actions;

B.    Quasi-judicial permits and actions; and

C.    Legislative actions. Each permit type is described in this chapter in terms of purpose and applicability, approving authority, and unique processing provisions. Also see chapter 17.14, "General Application Processing Procedures’, of this title for general application submittal, review, noticing/hearing, and appeal provisions. Exemptions to permit requirements are listed throughout this title. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.020 Zoning Clearance/Plan Check:
A.    Purpose And Applicability: The purpose of the zoning clearance/plan check is to ensure that all new and modified uses and structures comply with applicable provisions of this title, using simple administrative plan check procedures. Zoning clearance/plan check is required for all structures that require a building permit and for signs.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for zoning clearance/plan check is the planning director. The planning director approves, conditionally approves, or denies the zoning clearance/plan check in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Process: No application form is necessary for zoning clearance/plan check. This process will be conducted by planning staff as part of the building permit application review. Zoning clearance shall be granted only when the planning staff finds the proposal to be in conformance with all applicable provisions of this title. The planning director may modify plans in whole or in part, apply conditions of approval, or require guarantees to ensure compliance with applicable provisions of this title. Building permits shall not be issued without zoning clearance and plan check approval. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.030 Variance:
A.    Purpose And Applicability: In accordance with California Government Code section 65906, a variance request allows the city to grant exception to the development standards and provisions of this title in cases where, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, the strict application of this title deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical land use zoning districts. A variance approval is required to grant exception from any of the development standards and provisions of this title. Variance applications may not be granted for uses or activities not otherwise permitted by zoning district regulations.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for a variance is the planning commission or designee. The planning director provides a recommendation and the planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or denies the variance in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Findings: The planning commission may approve andlor modify any variance application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only if the applicant can demonstrate to the planning commission that the circumstances of their particular case can justify making all of the following findings:

1.    That there are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, or topography, such that the strict application of this title would deprive the property owner of privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity under identical land use zoning district classifications.

2.    That granting the variance does not constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and land use zoning district in which such property is located.

3.    That granting the variance will not adversely affect public health, safety, or welfare.

4.    That granting the variance is consistent with the objectives and policies of the general plan.

D.    Conditions: The planning commission may impose conditions for the variance to ensure compliance with this section and other applicable provisions of this title.

E.    Issuance: The final action on the variance by the planning commission shall constitute approval of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after the designated ten (10) day appeal period has been completed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.040 Temporary Use Permit:
A.    Purpose And Applicability: The purpose of a temporary use permit is to allow uses of a temporary nature on private property to exist for a specified length of time, in a manner that will not adversely affect public health, safety, or welfare. A temporary use permit is required before the construction or operation of any facilities or uses associated with any activity that requires authorization of a temporary use permit. See also permanent outdoor use provisions in chapter 17.86, "Outdoor Sales, Display, Storage, And Seating", of this title.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for temporary use permits is the planning commission. The planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or denies the temporary use permit in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Findings: A temporary use permit shall be granted only when the designated approving authority can make the following findings:

1.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the temporary use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, including introducing excessive dust, noise, light, odor, or other objectionable characteristics.

2.    The temporary use is in conformance with applicable provisions of this title and other regulations of the city, including, but not limited to, fire access and prevention, security provisions, and access to necessary water and sewer services.

3.    Removal of the use and site restoration will be ensured.

D.    Conditions/Guarantees: The following requirements shall apply to all temporary use permits. The approving authority may impose additional conditions and/or require guarantees to ensure conformance with this title.

1.    Requirements for vehicular ingress/egress and corresponding traffic safety provisions, parking requirements and facilities, and hours of operation.

2.    Regulation of nuisance factors (e.g., light glare, noise, vibration, smoke, dust, dirt, odors, gases, and heat).

3.    Regulation of maintenance and site restoration during and after termination of the temporary use or expiration of the temporary use permit. A bond or other form of security acceptable to the planning director may be required prior to the initiation of the use to ensure cleanup after the use is finished.

E.    Permit Issuance: The authorized signature of the planning director or the director’s designee on the completed temporary use permit application form shall signify issuance of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after the designated ten (10) day appeal period has been completed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.050 Minor Use Permit:
A.    Purpose And Applicability: The purpose of the minor use permit is to allow for administrative review and determination of requests for specific uses that warrant evaluation to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses. Qualifying uses are those that are minor in nature as determined by the approving authority, and can be conditioned to ensure protection of the public health, safety and welfare. The designated approving authority may grant minor use permits for the following uses, subject to all other provisions of this title:

1.    Outdoor sound amplification associated with an existing or proposed use;

2.    Outdoor seating as permitted pursuant to chapter 17.86, "outdoor Sales, Display, Storage, And Seating", of this title.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for minor use permits is the planning commission. The planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or denies the minor use permit in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Findings: The planning commission may approve and/or modify any application for a minor use permit in whole or in part, with or without conditions, with the following findings:

1.    The proposed use is consistent with the general plan and all applicable provisions of this title; and

2.    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size, design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such use, or the general welfare of the city.

D.    Conditions/Guarantees: The planning commission may impose conditions and/or require guarantees for the minor use permit to ensure compliance with this section and other applicable provisions of this title and to prevent adverse or detrimental impact to surrounding neighborhood.

E.    Permit Issuance: The final action on the minor use permit by the planning commission shall constitute approval of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after the designated ten (10) day appeal period has been completed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.060 Conditional Use Permit:
A.    Purpose And Applicability: The purpose of the conditional use permit (CUP) is for the individual review of uses, typically having unusual site development features or operating characteristics to ensure compatibility with surrounding areas and uses. A CUP is required for all uses specifically identified as requiring a CUP in division III, "Zoning Districts, Allowable Uses, And Development Standards", and division v, "Special Use Regulations", of this title.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for a CUP is the planning commission. The planning director provides a recommendation and the planning commission approves, conditionally approves, or denies the CUP in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Findings: Conditional use permits are quasi-judicial and shall be granted only when the planning commission determines that the proposed use or activity complies with all of the following findings:

1.    The proposed use is consistent with the general plan and all applicable provisions of this title; and

2.    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size, design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of the public.

D.    Conditions/Guarantees: The planning commission may impose conditions and/or require performance guarantees for the conditional use permit to ensure compliance with this section and other applicable provisions of this title and to prevent adverse or detrimental impacts to public health, safety, or welfare.

E.    Permit Issuance: The final action on the conditional use permit by the planning commission shall constitute approval of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after the designated ten (10) day appeal period has been completed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.070 Design Review:
A.    Purpose And Intent: The purpose of the design review process is to promote the orderly and harmonious growth of the city; to encourage development in keeping with the desired character of the city; to ensure physical, visual, and functional compatibility between uses; and to help prevent the depreciation of land values by ensuring proper attention is given to site and architectural design. This process is intended to provide a means for consideration of development proposals by which the site, architectural, and overall project design are substantially improved, and benefits to the city increased. However, this flexibility does not apply to land use. Only those uses permitted within the underlying zoning district are allowed. When no separate design review board exists and the planning commission performs this function, design review may occur at the same hearing as planning review at the discretion of the planning commission.

B.    Applicability: A design review process is required for the following items:

1.    Single-family residential development and additions thereof above the first floor or greater than five hundred (500) square feet in floor area;

2.    Planned developments and specific plans;

3.    Multi-family residential development;

4.    Nonresidential development (e.g., commercial, office, industrial, public/quasi-public, telecommunications tower installations); and

5.    Residential fence permits that do not meet the requirements of chapter 17.52 of this title.

C.    Exemptions: The following structures are exempt from design review. However, such structures may require additional permits, such as a ministerial building permit or administrative design review to ensure compliance with adopted building code standards and applicable zoning code provisions:

1.    Additions totaling no more than five hundred (500) square feet in size to nonresidential structures not visible from the public right of way viewing area;

2.    Accessory structures consistent with provisions of chapter 17.46, "Accessory Structures", of this title;

3.    Repairs to and maintenance of the site or structure that do not add to, enlarge, or expand the site coverage, volume, height, or floor area of the structure and that employ the same materials and design as the original construction;

4.    Interior alterations that do not change/expand the permitted use of the structure; and

5.    Construction, alteration, or maintenance by a public utility or public agency of utilities intended to service existing or nearby approved developments (e.g., water, gas, electric or telecommunication supply or disposal systems, including wires, mains, drains, sewers, pipes, conduits, cables, fire alarm boxes, police call boxes, traffic signals, hydrants, and similar facilities and equipment).

D.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authorities for design review are listed in table 17.16-1 of this section. The approving authority shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed design review application in accordance with the requirements of this section. Design review approval is required prior to issuance of any ministerial building permits or site improvement plans and prior to or in conjunction with discretionary action of corresponding development applications (e.g., conditional use permit, variance).

E.    Findings: Design review approval or any modification thereto shall be granted only when the designated approving authority makes all of the following findings:

1.    Any two-story construction requires notification of property owners pursuant to section 17.14.040, "Public Notices", of this title;

2.    The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the general plan, complies with applicable zoning regulations, specific plan provisions, planned unit development provisions, applicable city design guidelines, and improvement standards adopted by the city;

3.    The proposed architecture, site design, and landscape design are suitable for the purposes of the building and the site and will enhance the character of the neighborhood and the community;

4.    The architecture, including the character, scale and quality of the design, relationship with the site and other buildings, building materials, colors, screening of exterior appurtenances, exterior lighting and signing and similar elements establishes a clear design concept and is compatible with the character of buildings on adjoining and nearby properties;

5.    The proposed project addresses vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian transportation modes of circulation; and

6.    For specific plans and planned unit development design review applications, the proposed project is well integrated with the city’s street network, creates unique neighborhood environments, employs architectural design that fosters sense of community, and contributes to a pedestrian oriented environment.

F.    Conditions: The designated approving authority may require that the applicant modify plans in whole or in part and may condition the design review approval to ensure inclusion of specific design features, use of specific construction materials, and conformance with all applicable provisions of this title.

G.    Approval: The final design review action on the project by the designated approving authority shall constitute approval of the permit. Such permit shall only become valid after the designated ten (10) day appeal period has been completed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.16.080 Planned Developments:
A.    Purpose: The planned development (PD) process is established to provide the opportunity for unique and imaginative planning standards and regulations not provided through the application of standard zoning districts, for benefit to residents and the city.

1.    The PD process is intended to encourage the creative and imaginative planning of integrated, mixed use developments which provide a balance of residential, commercial, industrial, open space, parks, amenities, and support land uses.

2.    Where it is used in conjunction with a development project (a conditional use permit, tentative map, or other project), the PD process is used to provide detailed site planning, landscaping, and other requirements and standards which will govern a particular project.

3.    Once approved, a planned development will contain land use regulations and development standards that replace certain provisions of this title. Thus, a planned development must contain sufficient detail to allow city staff to implement its provisions and to describe to developers how properties within a PD project may be developed. Where no specific standard is contained in a PD (for example, parking or landscaping standards), the applicable provisions of this title shall govern.

B.    Approving Authority: The designated approving authority for a planned development (PD) is the city council. The planning director provides a recommendation to the planning commission, which in turn provides a recommendation to the city council which approves, conditionally approves, or denies the PD in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Designation: The abbreviation PD appearing on a planning application to the city indicates that the proposed project so identified is subject to the provisions of this section.

D.    Initiation Of The Planned Development Process: Proposals to prepare a PD may be initiated by the city of Greenfield or by any person as provided in this title. If initiated by an applicant other than the city, a preapplication meeting is strongly recommended.

E.    Mandatory Contents Of Planned Development: A PD shall be established by resolution, and each PO project applicant shall set forth in text, maps, and diagrams the following items, at the level of detail appropriate for the PO submittal. It is expressly intended that information for projects which are long term in nature or for which detailed planning may occur at a later date may provide some information at a conceptual level. If required elements are not provided, or are provided at a conceptual level, the PD shall include a schedule or program for providing these items, and may be conditioned to require the provision of these items prior to the approval of development projects within the PO. The following items are required for a complete PD application: An existing setting description which includes:

1.    A description of the physical characteristics of the site. The location of structures and other significant improvements shall be shown.

2.    The capacity of the existing and planned public services and facilities.

3.    The capacity of the existing and planned circulation system.

4.    The existing and planned land use of adjacent properties within five hundred feet (500').

5.    A boundary survey map in electronic file format of the property and a calculation of the gross land area within the proposed district. A tentative subdivision map may be substituted if the applicant proposes to subdivide the property.

6.    A detailed color orthophotograph in common electronic file format of identified scale, taken within the preceding two (2) years, of the PO area and surrounding properties.

7.    A discussion of specific objectives and limits for development of the property, which recognize and respond to identified opportunities and constraints of the PD area.

8.    Proposed land uses which correspond to the land use categories established by the general plan, and a statement of how the PO relates to the general plan. The density ranges of residential uses must correspond to density ranges established in the general plan.

9.    A land use plan identifying areas within the proposed PD and uses to be developed, supported by such related planning and development data as the city may require, including, but not limited to, proposed or projected acreage, population, housing units, and employment. The distribution of land uses shall be expressed in terms of acreage and the total number of residential units and/or square footage of nonresidential buildings allowed. Percentage of total land used for open space, parks, private land (including subtotals for each private land use), and public right of way shall be shown.

10.    A circulation plan showing existing and proposed public and private streets, pedestrianways, trails, and related transportation access or circulation features required to serve the proposed development. The circulation plan shall be supported by schematic designs of principal traffic and circulation improvements and such traffic engineering data as required by the city to demonstrate that existing and proposed facilities, both within and outside the PD, shall be adequate to serve land uses proposed by the development plan.

11.    A development plan and preliminary time schedule indicating the phasing and schedule, and indicating the total phasing of the PD and areas to be developed in phases and the time schedule for beginning of construction and for completion of each phase of development. This is specifically intended to be a generalized schedule and may be adjusted according to market constraints as the community develops except that proposed or required amenities shall be constructed ahead of residential and commercial products.

12.    Development standards for each of the proposed land use categories, including, but not limited to, regulations specifying:

a.    Permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited land uses;

b.    Amenities;

c.    Parks;

d.    Open space;

e.    Setbacks;

f.    Building heights;

g.    Site coverage;

h.    Parking;

i.    Grading;

j.    Applicable design guidelines, including site planning, architectural, and landscaping guidelines specific to the project;

k.    Signage, landscaping, and lighting; and

l.    Nonconforming uses, structures, and signage.

13.    A preliminary facilities and engineering report and overall plan describing anticipated requirements and proposed means of providing utility facilities and public services, including, but not limited to, storm drainage, sewage disposal, water supply, parks and recreation, and school facilities. This preliminary report and overall plan is not intended to constitute full engineering reports for project utilities and services. Rather, the submittal should communicate the type and magnitude of utilities and services needed for the project, along with a description of how such utilities and services will be provided.

14.    Significant natural features and existing trees to be retained for common open space, and provisions for preserving, maintaining, and using those areas.

15.    Describe in detail how the development proposed using the PD process provides park space above and beyond any required open space or buffers at a minimum ratio of 3.9 acres of park per one thousand (1,000) development residents using the most recent city of Greenfield population per household data published by the county of Monterey, whereas the 3.9 acres of park space requires a minimum of two (2) acres of community parks, 1.5 acres of neighborhood parks, and 0.4 acre of open space or greenbelt. Alternatively this could be paid via in lieu park fees, except for developments of fifty (50) dwelling units or more, which shall provide park space rather than in lieu fees. If designed in a manner that allows recreational uses, park space may also be used for the purpose of storm water percolation.

16.    Centrally located open space shall be provided above and beyond park space, in an amount that allows for passive recreation uses and pedestrian interconnections to other parts of the PD and the surrounding transportation network (streets, bike paths, sidewalks, etc.). In lieu fees shall not satisfy this requirement, although higher density development, infrastructure and quality of life amenities such as substantial increases in water efficiency, energy efficiency, alternative transportation amenities, or on site meeting and recreational facilities not otherwise required may modify the required amount of open space to a level that is appropriate for the project site. If designed in a manner that allows passive recreational uses, open space may also be used for the purpose of storm water percolation.

17.    Known manmade and natural hazards, and the methods for mitigating the impacts of these hazards.

18.    How the PD complies with the requirements of chapter 17.55, "Resource Efficiency", of this title.

19.    Procedure for review of proposed development. The procedures may include:

a.    Types of projects that require review, and the reviewing and approving authority for each type of project;

b.    Documents required from developers; and

c.    Review and hearing procedures, if any.

20.    If a PD incorporates by reference any provision of this title, this shall be specifically stated in the PD. Reference may be made only to the most current version of this title in effect at the time a permit is issued; the PD may not be used to "vest" standards in this title in effect at the time of the PD’s approval.

21.    A zoning code consistency analysis which identifies and describes all proposed inconsistencies with this title.

22.    Inclusionary housing plan that meets the requirements of section 17.50.050 of this title and the city of Greenfield’s inclusionary housing ordinance.

23.    Specific calculations and justifications for density bonus and density incentive provisions (if applicable).

F.    Findings: Prior to adopting or amending a PD, the city council shall make the following findings:

1.    That the proposed PD is consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives of the general plan.

3.    That the development proposed using the PO process provides park space above and beyond any required open space or buffers at a minimum ratio of 3.9 acres of park per one thousand (1,000) development residents using the most recent city of Greenfield population per household data published by the county of Monterey, whereas the 3.9 acres of park space requires a minimum of two (2) acres of community parks, 1.5 acres of neighborhood parks, and 0.4 acre of open space or greenbelt. Alternatively this could be paid via in lieu park fees, except for developments of fifty (50) dwelling units or more, which shall provide park space rather than in lieu fees.

4.    That park space, as required, is planned as an integral and organizing amenity with equal status and priority as other land uses and that remainder, irregular parcels are not selected for park locations.

5.    That centrally located open space is provided above and beyond park space, in an amount that allows for passive recreation uses and pedestrian interconnections to other parts of the PD and the surrounding transportation network (streets, bike paths, sidewalks, etc.). In lieu fees shall not satisfy this requirement, although higher density development, infrastructure and quality of life amenities such as substantial increases in water efficiency, energy efficiency, alternative transportation amenities, or on site meeting and recreational facilities not otherwise required may modify the required amount of open space to a level that is appropriate for the project site.

6.    That the PD complies with the requirements of chapter 17.55, "Resource Efficiency", of this title.

7.    That the proposed PD provides significant amenities and/or significant benefits to the development’s residents and to the community that could not be provided using the standard zoning provisions in this title.

B.    That all uses in the PD conform to the area, lot, and yard regulations normally required for such uses, except where the development and city will be improved by a deviation from such regulations.

9.    That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size, design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, or general welfare of the public.

17.24.030 Zoning District Boundaries:
If there is uncertainty about the location of any zoning district boundary shown on the official zoning map, the precise location of the boundary shall be determined by the director.

A.    Where a zoning district’s boundaries approximately follow lot, alley or street lines, such lot lines and street and alley centerlines shall be construed as the district boundaries;

B.    If a district boundary divides a parcel and the boundary line location is not specified by distances printed on the zoning map, the location of the boundary will be determined by using the scale appearing on the zoning map; and

C.    Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the property that was formerly in the street or alley will be included within the zoning district of the adjoining property on either side of the centerline of the vacated or abandoned street or alley. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.24.040 Conformance With Zoning District Regulations:
Except as otherwise provided in this title:

A.    No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building shall be moved, altered, added to, or enlarged, nor shall any land, building, or premises be used or designated for any purpose or in any manner other than is permitted in the zoning district in which such building, land or premises is located.

B.    No building shall be erected, reconstructed or structurally altered to exceed in height the limit designated in this title for the zoning district in which such building is located.

C.    No building shall be erected, nor shall any existing building be altered, enlarged or rebuilt, nor shall any open space be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity to the yard, building site area, and building location regulations designated in this title for the zoning district in which such building or open space is located.

D.    No yard or other open space abutting any building and provided for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this title shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building on any other building site. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.26.040    Use Table

17.26.010 Allowable Land Uses Generally:
Land use provisions are established in this title by the zoning district applied to a parcel. The uses of land allowed in each zoning district are listed in section 17.26.040, table 17.26-1 of this chapter by zoning district category in this division. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.26.020 Uses Not Listed:
Land uses that are not listed in the zoning district tables are not allowed, except as otherwise provided for in chapters 17.16, "Permit Requirements", 17.68, "Accessory Uses", and 17.92, "Temporary Uses", of this title. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.26.030 Similar Uses:
When a use is not specifically listed in this title, it shall be understood that the use may be permitted if the director determines that the use is similar to other uses listed. It is further recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this title and, anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, this section establishes the director’s authority to compare a proposed use and measure it against those uses listed in this title for determining similarity. In determining "similarity" the director shall make all of the following findings:

A.    The characteristics of, and activities associated with, the proposed use are equivalent to one or more of the listed uses, and will not involve a higher level of activity or population density than the uses listed in the district;

B.    The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning district; and

C.    The proposed use will be consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan. Determinations shall be made in writing and shall contain the facts that support the determination. The department shall maintain all such determinations on record at the public counter for review by the general public. All recorded determinations shall be provided to the planning commission, city council, city manager, city attorney, and city clerk as an information item within thirty (30) days of the director’s determination. The director’s decision may be appealed as provided in section 17.14.060, "Appeals", of this title. (Ord. 473, §3, 2007)

17.30.020    Characteristics Of The Districts

17.30.030    Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements

17.30.040    Development Standards

17.30.010 Purpose:
There are four (4) residential zoning district categories to implement the general plan residential land use designations as listed below: Residential estate zoning district (R-E) Single-family residential zoning district (R-L) Multiple-family residential zoning district (R-M) High density residential zoning district (R-H) General discussions of each residential zoning district are provided in section 17.30.020, "Characteristics Of The Districts", of this chapter. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.30.020 Characteristics Of The Districts:
The following descriptions of each zoning district identify the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development intended for that district. Refer to the development regulations for specific standards applicable to each residential district.

A.    Residential Estate (R-E): The residential estate zoning district designation is applied to areas of the city intended to accommodate very low density single-family residential uses in a semirural setting. The district implements the residential estate general plan land use designation. Residential densities shall be within the range of 1.0 to 2.0 dwelling units per acre with a minimum parcel size of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet. Property with this designation should serve as a transitional residential district between open space or agricultural uses and standard single-family neighborhoods.

B.    Single-Family Residential (R-L): The single-family residential zoning district designations are applied to areas of the city intended to accommodate low density single-family residential neighborhoods. Typical development includes detached (and in some cases attached) single-family homes. Permitted uses include single-family homes, second units, and compatible neighborhood support facilities. This district implements the single-family residential general plan land use designation with an allowed density range of 1.0 to 7.0 dwelling units per acre with a minimum parcel size of six thousand (6,000) square feet. Property with this designation should be located near other residential properties, schools, parks/open space, and neighborhood commercial services with low impact office and light industrial uses nearby. This district may include detached and attached housing types, as well as cluster developments. Building heights in this district are typically one and two (2) stories. Development standards allow for a variety of housing types.

C.    Multiple-Family Residential (R-M): The multiplefamily residential zoning district is intended to accommodate higher density single-family and lower density multi-family residential neighborhoods. This district accommodates a variety of housing types with a density range between 7.0 and 15.0 dwelling units per acre. Detached and attached single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes, condominiums, row houses, and garden apartments are permitted. Development standards for this district allow significant design flexibility to encourage a broad range of housing types and are intended to ensure compatibility and connectivity with surrounding neighborhoods and uses. Residential structures are typically one and two (2) stories in height (3 stories in some cases) with greater lot coverage than the low density single-family residential districts. The R-M district should serve as a transitional residential district between lower density single-family neighborhoods and high density residential districts, office buildings, commercial uses, or light industrial uses. R-M sites should be located near arterial or collector roads. This district implements the medium density residential general plan land use designation.

D.    High Density Infill (R-H): The high density residential zoning district is applied to areas of the city intended to accommodate higher density multi-family development such as apartments and condominiums. This designation may also include high density single-family development types such as townhomes and other attached housing types. High density detached homes may also be considered in the R-H district on a case by case basis with a conditional use permit request. This district implements the high density residential general plan land use designation. Residential densities shall be in the range of twelve (12) to twenty one (21) dwelling units per acre. Property with this designation should be located near other multi-family sites, office, commercial uses, or light industrial areas. Additionally, multi-family residential sites should be located along thoroughfare, arterial, or collector roads or near existing or planned public transit stops. Standards for these districts promote attractive residential development that is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods, while at the same time carefully regulating uses to assure compatible development that limit impacts on surrounding uses. Development is typically two (2) stories in height (3 stories in some cases) with greater lot coverage than the medium density residential districts. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.30.030 Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements:
Section 17.26.040, table 17.26-1 of this title identifies allowed uses for all residential zoning districts subject to compliance with chapter 17.26, "Allowable Land Uses", of this title and all other provisions of this title. Descriptions of many land use listings can be found in division VI, "Zoning Definitions", of this title. Note: The far right column, "Specific Use Regulations Of This Title", in the table includes the section number(s) for regulations that apply to the particular use listed, in addition to the other general standards of this title. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.30.040 Development Standards:
The development standards in this section have been divided into individual tables by primary residential zoning district categories as follows:

17.32.010 Purpose:
The commercial zoning districts implement the land use policies as well as the commercial office and mixed use land use designations contained in the general plan. Each of the commercial zoning districts allows for a specific range of commercial activities as well as a range of development intensity. Some of these districts support neighborhood oriented commercial activities while others support commercial uses serving a local or regional market area. The development standards associated with the commercial zoning districts promote a variety of development types and corresponding uses intended to support and enhance the economic vitality of Greenfield. The regulations for the districts are designed to promote development flexibility while at the same time providing a level of certainty to owners, developers, residents, neighbors, and decision makers.

17.32.020 Characteristics Of The Districts:
The following descriptions of each zoning district identify the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development intended for that district. Refer to the development regulations for specific standards applicable to each commercial district.

A.    Neighborhood Commercial (C-N): The neighborhood commercial district is designed to foster low intensity neighborhood oriented commercial development adjacent to, integrated within, or at the entrances to residential neighborhoods. It is intended to promote a mix of retail goods and services and low intensity mixed use development. Neighborhood commercial properties should be developed with buildings that are similar in scale to nearby residences. Development should be pedestrian oriented with entrances and windows oriented to the sidewalk/street.

B.    Retail Business (C-R): The retail business designation is intended to allow for medium to high intensity uses with a wide range of retail, entertainment, office, services, and professional uses. Mixed use facilities are permitted in compliance with the requirements set forth in section 17.42.030, "Mixed Use Overlay (MUO)", of this title. Development should be pedestrian oriented and located on sites adjacent to other commercial uses, office uses or higher density residential development. When located adjacent to single-family residential, vehicles using the commercial site should not have a direct impact on the entrances to the neighborhood, but pedestrian connections should be provided. C-R sites should be located downtown, along arterials, or at major intersections. Development should provide a pleasant visual atmosphere, a safe and comfortable environment for pedestrians, and include parking for alternative modes of transportation including bicycles and motorcycles. Any projects proposed in the C-R district will be well designed using superior construction materials and methods. Any proposals shall coordinate new construction and renovation projects with other buildings and structures in the vicinity as to siting, architectural design, color selection and landscape design, and the inclusion of other features that will enhance the neighborhood in which the buildings, structures and other improvements are to be located, by requiring the implementation of the downtown design guidelines (October 2001) in all areas zoned C-R. All site plans, building elevations, signage, architectural and design features, off street parking facilities and landscaping shall be designed, approved, and constructed in accordance with the adopted downtown design guidelines (October 2001), included herein by reference.

C.    Highway Commercial (C-H): Development in the highway commercial district is expected to be grouped near State Highway 101. Uses in this district should be designed to serve primarily city residents but have regional draw. Uses in the C-H zone should be destination places with a diverse mix of uses and activities. Potential uses within the zone may include gas stations, restaurants, large scale retail, hotels, and entertainment venues. These uses benefit from proximity to freeway interchanges to accommodate higher traffic volumes associated with "destination" places. All site plans and building elevations shall be designed and approved, and all signage, architectural and design features, off street parking facilities and landscaping shall be designed and constructed, in accordance with the highway commercial design guidelines, included herein by reference. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.34.010 Purpose:
The professional office zoning district implements the land use policies and land use designation for the professional office (P-O) designation in the general plan. The P-O designation is intended to provide space for medical facilities, business uses, and professional offices. The purposes of the P-O district development standards are to increase employment opportunities, improve Greenfield’s economic vitality, promote attractive development, and ensure minimal impacts on surrounding development. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.34.020 Characteristics of the District:
The professional office designation is intended for development located along thoroughfares, arterials, or collectors or near existing/planned public transit stops. This designation allows mixed use development with owner-occupied or rental units on the second story and high density development in conjunction with nonresidential development. The designation should be used on sites adjacent to other commercial uses or higher density residential development. The district is intended for office development that may include medical facilities, professional offices such as law firms and real estate, administrative offices, corporate offices, and research and development activities and is characterized by attractive landscaped sites with shared parking areas. Complimentary retail and commercial, including restaurant, uses may be allowed either as secondary uses in office complexes or as separate freestanding facilities. The district regulations are intended to prevent the development of strip commercial centers. Office development should be designed to be pedestrian friendly, but should also be auto accommodating. Development should take advantage of existing or planned public transit opportunities. (Ord. 503 §2, 2014: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.34.030 Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements:
Section 17.26.040, table 17.26-1 of this title identifies allowed uses for the professional office zoning districts subject to compliance with chapter 17.26, "Allowable Land Uses", of this title.

17.36.030    Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements

17.36.040    Development Standards

17.36.010 Purpose:
The industrial zoning districts implement the industrial land use policies and land use designations contained in the general plan. Each of the industrial zoning districts allows for a specific range of industrial activities and provides standards governing the intensity of uses in order to carefully regulate the impacts of such uses. The two (2) industrial zoning districts are designed to preserve areas for the manufacture, assembly, processing, storage, and shipment of finished and raw materials as well as related office uses. While the development standards associated with the industrial zoning districts are intended to enhance employment opportunities and the overall economic vitality of Greenfield, these regulations are also designed to promote attractive development and safeguard the public from potential adverse impacts associated with industrial land uses. Furthermore, the district regulations are designed to provide a level of certainty to owners, developers, businesses, residents, neighbors, and decision makers. In some areas of the city a gateway overlay is included in this district. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.36.020 Characteristics Of The Districts:
The following descriptions of each zoning district identify the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development intended for that district. Refer to the development regulations for specific standards applicable to each industrial district.

A.    Light Industrial (I-L): The light industrial district is intended for low to medium intensity uses that involve processing, packaging, machining, repair, fabricating, distribution, warehousing and storage, research and development, and similar uses which do not result in significant impacts from noise, odor, vibration, smoke, or other pollutants. These uses should, when possible, be combined in development projects that incorporate various uses to minimize travel and transport for goods and services related to and required to support the industrial use. This approach is also designed to help reduce regional commuter traffic by providing employment opportunities for residents of Greenfield within the city limits. In addition, the development standards are designed to promote attractive construction that is compatible with the surrounding area. Sites designated for I-L uses should be located on medium to large size sites along thoroughfares, arterials, or collectors adjacent to other office, industrial, commercial or higher density residential uses. Residential uses of any kind are prohibited in this district with the exception of a caretaker residence. There should be sufficient and clearly defined parking and loading areas. Adequate and secure parking for bicycles shall be provided. Facilities shall have separate visitor entrances with walkways separated from vehicle circulation that connect with visitor parking and with the public right of way.

B.    Heavy Industrial (I-H): The heavy industrial district allows for industrial uses that, due to potential impacts such as noise, dust, odor, and vibration, would not be appropriate in the light industrial areas. Heavy industrial uses would include processing of agricultural products, winery facilities not open to the public, and agricultural support facilities such as box making facilities, packaging plants, equipment repair, trucking companies, manufacturing, fabrication, cement batch plants, asphalt plants, and other heavy industrial uses. Sites designated for heavy industrial uses should not be located near residential development. Furthermore, residential uses of any kind are prohibited in this district with the exception of a caretaker residence. Development standards are designed to limit noise, odors, traffic, hazardous materials, and other health and safety risks as well as ensure safe, functional, and environmentally sound development. There should be sufficient and clearly defined parking and loading areas with separate circulation for trucks and passenger vehicles. Adequate and secure parking for bicycles shall be provided. Facilities shall have separate visitor entrances with walkways separated from vehicle circulation that connect with visitor parking and with the public right of way. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.36.030 Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements:
Section 17.26.040, table 17-26.1 of this title identifies allowed uses for the two (2) industrial zoning districts subject to compliance with chapter 17.26, "Allowable Land Uses", of this title and all other provisions of this title. Descriptions of many land use listings can be found in division VI, "Zoning Definitions", of this title. Note: The far right column, "Specific Use Regulations Of This Title" in the table includes the section number(s) for regulations that apply to the particular use listed, in addition to the other general standards of this title. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.36.040 Development Standards:
The development standards listed below, along with relevant applicable adopted citywide design guidelines, are intended to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the city’s minimum requirements and expectations for high quality industrial development.

17.38.020 Characteristics Of The District:
The following description of the district identifies the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development intended for the district. Refer to the development regulations for specific standards applicable to the public and quasi-public (P-QP) district.

A.    Public And Quasi-Public Land Use (P-QP): The public and quasi-public district is used to support the needs of the community through governmental, civic, cultural, health, education, and infrastructure uses. These facilities should be located in a manner that best serves the community’s interests, allows for adequate transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access to minimize trip generation and maximize community convenience. This designation includes properties owned by agencies such as schools, libraries, fire stations, and privately owned transportation and utility corridors such as power transmission line. In specific locations, mixed use projects may be determined to be consistent with this designation. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.40.010 Purpose:
The open space zoning district is intended to preserve and enhance public and private open space, natural areas, public services, and improved park and recreational areas. The district is used to implement the general plan land use recreation and open space designation. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.40.020 Characteristics Of The District:
The following description of the district identifies the characteristic uses, intensity of uses, and level of development. Refer to the development regulations for specific standards applicable to the open space (0-5) zoning district.

A.    Open Space Land Use (0-5): Recreation facilities and passive open space contribute to the quality of life in a community, providing visual buffers, natural areas, traditional parks, hiking and biking trails, and other landscaped areas. Large scale projects must include landscaping and open space as part of the overall site plan. The responsibility and financial capability to develop, maintain, and manage open space areas in a sound manner must also be considered during site plan review. Open space can be integrated into a project as a parkway along arterials adjacent to the site or as a required agricultural buffer. These areas can provide buffering for adjacent uses and add aesthetic appeal to the development. Landscaped berms can be used to provide a more aesthetic setting for bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. These "linear parkways" can also be designed to link neighborhood commercial centers, schools, recreation, and other public facilities with convenient access. Appropriate uses in this designation are open space, recreational areas, local and regional parks, trails, and ancillary commercial uses specifically related to adjoining recreational areas. The construction of privately owned residences, general commercial uses, or the subdivision of land for purposes of urban development is inconsistent with the open space district. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.40.030 Allowed Uses And Permit Requirements:
Section 17.26.040, table 17.26-1 of this title identifies allowed uses for the open space zoning district subject to compliance with chapter 17.26, "Allowable Land Uses", of this title and all other provisions of this title. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

The provisions of this section shall apply to all projects with overlay zoning. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.42.020 Designation Of Overlay Zoning:
Overlay zoning shall be designated by representative symbols within parentheses on the zoning map following the base zoning district. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.42.030 Mixed Use Overlay (MUO):
A.    Purpose And Intent: The purpose of the mixed use overlay (MUO) district is to provide an opportunity for the development of residential units in conjunction with a different underlying land use designation. Areas designated downtown commercial and professional offices are also designated with the mixed use overlay. Areas designated neighborhood commercial and highway commercial shall be considered for the addition of the mixed use overlay on a case-by-case basis. Even if not so designated on the zoning map, the mixed use overlay shall apply to any commercial or professional office property that will incorporate low- or very low-income residential housing units within a commercial or professional office development project. The intent of this district is to provide housing opportunities without reducing available land for commercial and professional office development. Mixed use development is intended to blend residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses, where those functions are physically and functionally integrated, and allows people to live and work in the same area, increasing the presence of people during extended hours, hence increased social and economic vitality in mixed use areas. The benefits of mixed use development include greater housing variety and density; reduced distances between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other destinations; more compact development, stronger neighborhood character, and pedestrian and bicycle-friendly environments.

B.    Applicability Of Mixed Use Overlay: Property with the MUO classification on the zoning map is subject to the provisions of this division in addition to those of the underlying zone.

C.    Permitted Uses: In addition to the permitted uses in the underlying zoning district, the mixed use overlay establishes residential use as a permitted use. For this section, "mixed use development" means residential units developed in conjunction with another underlying zoning district. Residential uses are permitted on the second and third stories of structures or behind commercial, retail, or professional office frontage on the ground floor. For purposes of this section and the allowable land uses designated in section 17.26.040, emergency shelters, single-room occupancy facilities, and employee housing as defined in chapter 17.80, and residential care facilities as defined in chapter 17.88, may be developed in the retail business (C-R) and highway commercial (C-H) zoning districts with a mixed use overlay without also developing the commercial or retail development otherwise required by the underlying zoning district, subject to issuance of a conditional use permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, emergency shelters are not allowed uses in the highway commercial (C-H) zoning district. Residential uses as part of a mixed use development are allowed in the C-N neighborhood commercial, C-R retail business, C-H highway commercial, and P-O professional office zoning districts subject to the allowed uses and permit requirements designated in the land use table, Table 17.26-1, of section 17.26.040.

D.    Development Standards: Parking must be supplied in accordance with chapter 17.58, "Parking." One residential unit per floor is allowed for every three thousand (3,000) square feet of commercial or office space. Additional units may be granted in accordance with the state density bonus provision, any density bonus ordinance enacted by the city, or by means of a development agreement adopted pursuant to section 17.16.160. The development shall comply with the development standards for the underlying zoning district. The opportunity for mixed use development shall be considered in conjunction with the design review process.

E.    Design Review Required: Design review required for all mixed use development within the city per section 17.16.070, "Design Review." (Ord. 533 §2(part), 2018: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.42.040 Gateway Overlay (GWO):
A.    Purpose And Intent: Commercial and visitor serving areas that are located at the northern and southern entrances to the community serve as "gateways" to Greenfield. These areas should be made aesthetically attractive since they provide an influential visual statement regarding the character of the community. Such areas should be designed to provide visual amenities that are not required for uses designed to serve more local needs. The purpose of the gateway overlay is to require the provision of attractive signage, additional landscaping, and greater attention to building design and lighting.

B.    Applicability Of Gateway Overlay: The "(GWO)" appearing after a zone abbreviation on the zoning map indicates that the property so classified is subject to the provisions of this division in addition to those of the underlying zone.

C.    Development Standards: Development subject to the gateway overlay standards requires a higher level of attention to architectural design, landscaping, lighting, and signage. Development within this overlay shall be subject to the design standards established in the city of Greenfield gateway districts design guidelines, incorporated as part of this code by reference.

D.    Design Review Required: Design review is required for all new construction, renovations, remodels, improvements, or changes within the GWO districts. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

D.    Employment Requirement: New development in the industrial park overlay (IPO) must create new permanent full time jobs (40 hours worked per week) or the hourly equivalent within city limits. The number of full time jobs created must be at least six (6) full time jobs per gross acre of land developed or one full time job for every two thousand (2,000) square feet of gross floor area, whichever is greater. Exceptions based on hardship may be granted by the planning commission on a case by case basis.

E.    Design Review Required: Design review is required for all new construction, renovations, remodels, improvements, or changes within the IPO districts. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.42.060 Regional Commercial Overlay (RCO):
Highway commercial areas that are intended to draw from a regional market should provide amenities beyond those required for uses that are designed to serve more local needs. Regional commercial development must be developed in a manner that enhances the community.

A.    Purpose: The purpose of the regional commercial overlay (RCO) is to require increased standards for parking spaces, additional landscaping, and greater attention to buffering commercial uses from nearby residential and agricultural uses. In order to ensure regional commercial development that enhances the community, a design overlay that addresses such requirements is provided for areas designated for this type of development.

B.    Applicability Of Regional Commercial Overlay: The "(RCO)" appearing after a zone abbreviation on the zoning map indicates that the property so classified is subject to the provisions of this division in addition to those of the underlying zone.

C.    Development Standards: Development within the regional commercial overlay requires a higher level of attention to architectural design, landscaping, lighting, and signage, and higher ratios of parking. Development within this overlay shall be subject to the design standards established in the city of Greenfield citywide design guidelines, incorporated as part of this title by reference.

Parking requirements for this overlay are 4.5 parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of net retail space. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.42.070 Agricultural Research And Development Overlay (RDO):
A.    Purpose: The purpose of the agricultural research and development overlay (RDO) district is to allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the development of agriculturally related industrial sites and to encourage compatible development within the overlay district.

B.    Applicability of Research and Development Overlay (RDO) Districts: The (RDO) appearing after a zone abbreviation on the zoning map indicates that the property so classified is subject to the provisions of this article in addition to those of the underlying zone.

C.    Permitted Uses: The agricultural research and development overlay district alters the permitted uses in the zoning district under which the overlay district is located. Any uses permitted in the district, or portion thereof so overlaid, shall be permitted subject to all provisions applicable to the district as hereinafter set forth. In addition, buildings within the district may be constructed, altered, enlarged or reconstructed for any of the following specified uses and uses customarily accessory to such uses: educational, manufacturing, assembling, packaging, agricultural research and development, processing, fabrication, warehousing, wholesaling, and accessory parking.

D.    Development Standards: Development within the agricultural research and development overlay districts shall be consistent with the underlying light industrial zoning district with the exception of maximum lot coverage. The agricultural research and development overlay districts shall limit maximum lot coverage to fifty percent (50%). Development within this overlay shall be subject to the design standards established in the city of Greenfield research and development districts design guidelines, incorporated as part of this code by reference.

E.    Design Review Required: Design review is required for all new construction, renovations, remodels, improvements, or changes within the RDO districts per section 17.16.070, Design Review.

Article VI of the zoning code includes all definitions associated with the preceding articles. The following definitions are relevant to the proposed RDO, and therefore should be added to Article VI:

"Agricultural" means relating to or used in or promoting agriculture or farming. The use of land for production of crops, including horticulture, floriculture and viticulture, but excluding the raising of livestock for commercial purposes and excluding any other uses such as would create offensive and noxious odors.

B.    In the case of a housing development providing for sale very low-, low-, or moderate-income target units, the initial occupant of the target unit must be a person or family of very low, low, or moderate income, as required, and the units must be offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Section 50052.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. Upon resale, the seller of the target units shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial subsidy, as defined herein, and its proportionate share of appreciation, as defined herein, which amount shall be used within five (5) years for any of the purposes described in Section 33334.2(e) of the California Health and Safety Code that promote homeownership.

All residential development consisting of five (5) or more units or lots in the city shall provide inclusionary units on site, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The city’s density bonus ordinance shall be applicable to proposed projects which conform to the density bonus ordinance requirements. Multifamily projects designed as rental projects shall require a set-aside of twenty percent (20%) of the units as inclusionary rental units. Traditional subdivision projects shall require a set aside of twenty percent (20%) of the units as for-sale inclusionary units. Both mixed-use projects and projects of mixed housing type shall require a set-aside of twenty percent (20%) of the units included in the development as inclusionary units; however, the number and type of rental inclusionary units and for-sale inclusionary units shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and set forth in the affordable housing agreement.

A.    Multifamily Rental Inclusionary Units: For multifamily rental inclusionary units ten percent (10%) of the total units in the development shall be set aside for low income households and ten percent (10%) of the total units in the development shall be set aside for very low income households.

B.    Non-Multifamily Rental Inclusionary Units: For rental units other than multifamily units, ten percent (10%) of the total units in the residential development shall be set aside for low income households and ten percent (10%) shall be set aside for moderate income households.

1.    Where the number of required moderate income units is not a whole number, the fractional units required shall be added to the number of low income inclusionary units required.

2.    If the resultant number of low income units is not a whole number, the fractional units required shall be added to the number of very low income units required.

3.    Where (after any addition of fractional units under the preceding sentences) the number of very low income inclusionary units required is not a whole number, the applicant shall either include the next higher whole number of very low income inclusionary units or elect to pay a fractional unit in-lieu fee for the fractional unit in the amount provided in section 17.51.080.

D.    The size, design, and location of inclusionary units shall be consistent with the city general plan, zoning ordinance, and other city ordinances and building standards. The inclusionary units shall be substantially the same in type of units as the market rate units and externally compatible in materials and architecture. However, on a case-by-case basis, the number of each type of unit (e.g., single-family, duplex, townhouse, etc.) and the number of for-sale and rental units, may deviate from the standards of this chapter, provided the city council makes written findings supporting the determination that such deviation(s) are consistent with the intent of this chapter and that the total number of inclusionary units complies with the requirements of this chapter. The number of each type of inclusionary unit and the number of for-sale inclusionary units and rental inclusionary units shall be set forth in the affordable housing agreement. An application for each deviation as required by the zoning ordinance or any other city ordinance, such as (but not limited to) an application for a planned unit development or rezoning, shall be submitted by the applicant and processed in the same manner as other similar applications.

1.    Compliance may be accomplished by the developer alone or in combination with others, including without limitation the housing authority of Monterey County, CHISPA, or another nonprofit housing corporation approved by the city.

2.    In the event that the affordable housing agreement includes a provision for the construction of inclusionary units by a qualified nonprofit housing corporation, the pacing of construction of the market rate units shall not be tied to the pacing of construction of the inclusionary units unless otherwise specified in the affordable housing agreement or the conditions of approval. (Ord. 492 §1(part), 2011).

17.51.070 On-Site Inclusionary Units.
A.    To satisfy its inclusionary requirements on site, a residential development must construct inclusionary units in an amount equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of units approved for the residential development (except to the extent a fraction of a unit would be required, for which the applicant shall either construct a unit or substitute a fractional unit fee). Initial and subsequent affordability levels and eligible occupants of the inclusionary units shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.

4.    Contain or exceed the average number of bedrooms in the development’s market-rate units; however, size of bedrooms may differ to the extent authorized in the affordable housing agreement. (Ord. 492 §1(part), 2011).

17.51.080 In-Lieu Fees.
Projects may pay a fee in lieu of constructing affordable units in accordance with the provisions of this section.

A.    Qualification for In-Lieu Fee: The developer of a residential development containing five (5) or more units may elect to pay a fee in-lieu of providing a required inclusionary unit only if the twenty percent (20%) obligation results in a fractional unit and only as to that fractional unit.

B.    Fee Amount: The fee amount shall be determined and shall be included in the affordable housing agreement as follows:

1.    The fee shall be twenty percent (20%) of the cost of developing the average market-rate unit proposed for the development multiplied by the number of inclusionary units for which the fee is being paid.

2.    The city shall prepare a table that identifies in-lieu fee amounts based on criteria stated in the administrative manual. The council shall adopt an annual in-lieu fee table by resolution and shall update it on an annual basis; however, the previous year’s table shall remain in effect until such time as the table is updated.

C.    For approved projects that are being developed in one phase, payment of in-lieu fees shall be made in full to the city prior to recordation of parcel or final maps or, where the residential development is not subject to subdivision approval, prior to issuance of the first building permit for the development. For projects that are being developed in more than one phase, the requirements of this section may, at the applicant’s discretion, be accomplished on a phase-by-phase basis, with in-lieu fees paid prior to the issuance of building permits for each phase. (Ord. 492 §1(part), 2011).

17.51.090 Development Project Approval.
A.    From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, a residential development application will not be deemed complete until the applicant has an affordable housing plan that demonstrates the manner in which the applicant proposes to meet the requirements of this chapter, including any plans that indicate location of on-site units or intent to pay in-lieu fees.

B.    Conditions to carry out this chapter shall be imposed on the first approval of a residential development. When granting the first approval, the appropriate authority shall determine and include as a condition of approval:

1.    The method of compliance with this chapter, including whether the residential development will comply with this chapter through provision of on-site units or payment of an in-lieu fee or combination thereof;

3.    Such other matters as the appropriate authority deems proper.

C.    The conditions of approval shall further provide that prior to the recordation of the parcel map or final map in the case of subdivisions and/or prior to the issuance of building permits in the case of all other land use permits to which this chapter applies, the applicant shall enter into an affordable housing agreement acceptable to the city that contains specific requirements implementing the conditions of approval including, but not limited to, as applicable, the number of inclusionary units, the level(s) of affordability, location and type of inclusionary units, timing of construction of inclusionary units in relation to the construction of the market rate units in the development, preferences given in selecting occupants, and amount of the in-lieu fee, if any.

1.    The affordable housing agreement may be amended by the parties in the same manner in which it was adopted, provided the amendment is consistent with the conditions of approval and any subsequent city approvals, including specifically the number of on-site units provided for in the original affordable housing agreement.

2.    The imposition of conditions on the first approval pursuant to this chapter does not preclude the appropriate authority from imposing such other conditions as may be required by this chapter when acting on a subsequent application for a subsequent approval for all or part of the same residential development.

D.    Where a residential development receives a subdivision approval, the final subdivision map or parcel map that is to be filed and recorded shall include a notation, in a form acceptable to the city attorney and consistent with the Subdivision Map Act, describing the conditions of approval to comply with this chapter.

E.    Any determination made by the appropriate authority to implement this chapter in connection with granting a first approval may be appealed pursuant to the appeal provisions of the city code or other applicable appeal provisions by which the first approval may be appealed. (Ord. 492 §1(part), 2011).

17.51.100 Occupancy And Continuing Availability Of Units.
A.    Inclusionary rental units shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated income group for a minimum of fifty-five (55) years. In addition to the income of a targeted group, limitations on assets may also be used as a factor in determining eligibility for rental or for sale units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, no inclusionary unit shall be rented for an amount which exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the actual rent charged for a comparable market unit in the same development, if any.

1.    Rental inclusionary units shall be rented only to eligible households, at affordable rents for the relevant income category, and pursuant to any further requirements set forth in the affordable housing agreement or other relevant documents pursuant to this chapter.

2.    All leases or rental agreements for rental inclusionary units shall require annual certification by the city or its designee to determine, at a minimum, the rental cost of the unit, any other relevant charges to the tenant, tenant household income, and the inclusion of a provision prohibiting subletting or assignment of the inclusionary unit to an unqualified tenant shall be certified annually.

B.    For-sale inclusionary units shall be sold only to eligible households at prices affordable to such households and pursuant to further requirements of resale restrictions as determined by the affordable housing agreement and other provisions of this chapter. The initial maximum sale price of the inclusionary unit to the first purchaser shall be determined by the appropriate authority, pursuant to a method set forth in the administrative manual. Similar restrictions shall be required of subsequent owners at the time they acquire the unit.

1.    After the initial sale of the inclusionary for-sale units at a price affordable to the target income level group, inclusionary for-sale units shall remain affordable to subsequent income eligible buyers pursuant to a resale restriction with a term of forty-five (45) years. For-sale units may be sold at market price under the conditions set forth in this section and consistent with the administrative manual.

a.    Base Resale Price: The price at which the owner purchased the affordable unit shall be adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the median annual income at one hundred percent (100%) of median of a family of four (4) in Monterey County.

b.    The percentage increase or decrease shall be computed for the period that the affordable unit is held by the owner.

c.    This adjusted price shall be increased by the market value, if any, of any documented, permanent capital real estate or fixed improvements approved by the city.

d.    The maximum permitted resale price shall be reduced to the extent the unit has been adversely affected in value by deficient or deferred maintenance. To facilitate a determination by the building official concerning maintenance at the time of resale, the seller shall comply with any applicable requirements in the administrative manual.

e.    Where an owner has lawfully added a bedroom to a for-sale inclusionary unit, the maximum resale price of the unit shall be calculated based on the existing number of bedrooms and assuming a household size corresponding to the total number of bedrooms, including the added bedroom.

(Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.55.030 Resource Efficiency Standards:
A.    Required Resource Efficiency Features: All applicable projects as noted in section 17.55.020 of this chapter must include all general resource efficiency features in their project design, or alternatively through conditions of approval, at the discretion of the planning director as follows:

1.    Construction Resources: Construction contractors shall implement a waste management and responsible construction materials program (WMRCMP) for all major discretionary projects, as outlined in section 17.55.020 of this chapter. The WMRCMP shall include everything listed below and shall be a condition of approval for applicable projects. The WMRCMP shall be reviewed and approved by the city of Greenfield building and planning department prior to issuance of building or demolition permits for said applicable development projects.

Construction contractors shall implement a Waste Management Recycling Program (WMRP) to be reviewed and approved by the City of Greenfield Building and Planning Department prior to issuance of building or demolition permits. Many natural resources are saved by recycling construction site waste, while salvaging, reusing, and recycling these materials can reduce disposal costs, extend the life of landfills, and create jobs. The program shall include the following two sections. Each section will be reviewed and approved as noted.

SECTION ONE: Submitted and approved prior to issuance of building or demolition permits:

1.    Salvage and Deconstruction: Identify the items you anticipate salvaging and the salvage company that will be used.

2.    Inert Solids: Identify inert solids that will be generated and identify how these will be diverted from disposal through salvaging, reusing or recycling 100% of inert solids, including asphalt, brick, concrete, dirt, fines, rock, sand, soil, and stone.

3.    Separation On-Site: In addition to 100% diversion of inert solids, SO% of non-inert materials must be diverted, including wood, metal, cardboard, green waste, gypsum, and fixtures. Non-inert materials may be separated on-site for recycling and will count towards the 50% diversion requirement. Identify materials that will be separated on-site for recycling companies.

4.    Mixed Construction and Demolition (C&D) Debris: If non-inert materials are not separated on-site for recycling, or if the materials separated for recycling are not at least 50% of the total mixed debris generated, then mixed C&D must be taken to a mixed C&D sorting facility that will separate and recycle for you. Indicate the mixed C&D sorting facilities you intend to use.

5.    Disposal: Indicate what percentage of all debris generated will be disposed, what materials you expect to dispose of, and what facility(ies) you will use.

6.    Hauling of debris: Indicate how you intend to transport debris.

SECTION TWO: Submitted and approved following the removal of all debris and prior to issuance of occupancy for any buildings on-site:

Requires documentation of debris handling during the project and submittal of receipts, or equivalent documentation, demonstrating that 100% of inert solids and SO% of the remaining construction and demolition debris were diverted. Upon completion of the project, the contractor will have 30 days in which to submit Section Two with the required receipts, or equivalent documentation to demonstrate compliance with the WMRP. If the 100% of inert solids and SO% of the remaining construction and demolition debris diversions are met, then the entire deposit will be returned within 14 days upon submittal of all original receipts. If the diversion rates are not met, only a pro rata portion of the deposit will be returned to the applicant.

2.    Water Use Efficiency: Features to increase water use efficiency shall be included in project designs for all applicable projects, as outlined in section 17.55.020 of this chapter. Project design shall include the use of both potable and nonpotable water to the maximum extent practicable and use of low flow appliances (i.e., toilets, shower heads, washing machines, dishwashers, drought resistant landscaping, drip irrigation systems, automatic shutoff valves for sinks in restrooms, etc.).

3.    Energy Efficiency: Features to increase energy efficiency shall be included in project designs for all applicable projects, as outlined in section 17.55.020 of this chapter. Project design shall include use of energy efficient appliances meeting the Energy Star rating or better. All lightbulbs, as appropriate, shall be energy efficient, such as compact fluorescents or light emitting diodes (LED). Confirmation of compliance with this requirement will take place at final building inspection.

B.    Resource Efficiency Features: All applicable projects as noted in section 17.55.020 of this chapter must include the number of resource efficiency features as required in said section, or alternatively through conditions of approval, at the discretion of the planning director as follows:

1.    Gray water Systems: The installation of a gray water system in new or renovated buildings that eliminates the need for landscape irrigation. "Gray water" is the wastewater produced from bathtubs, showers, and clothes washers. In order to conserve water, it can be used for irrigation through subsurface distribution systems. A permit is required from the department of environmental health for the gray water system1.

2.    Energy Efficiency: Increase energy efficiency twenty percent (20%) beyond title 24 requirements through the use of innovative design and technology (i.e., natural daylighting, passive heating/cooling, green roofs, additional insulation, or on site renewable electricity generation).

3.    Construction Materials Efficiency: Use of over ten percent (10%) (based on cost) postconsumer recycled content construction materials. "Postconsumer material" is defined as waste material generated by households or by commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as end users of the product, which can no longer be used for its intended purpose. "Recycled content" shall be defined in accordance with the International Organization of Standards document, "ISO 14021 - Environmental Labels And Declarations Self-Declared Environmental Claims (Type II Environmental Labeling)".

4.    Land Use Efficiency: Development of the proposed project at the maximum density allowed under the general plan with the inclusion of transit oriented design, jobs/housing proximity, and alternative forms of transportation (i.e., bicycles, charging stations for electric cars, pedestrian friendly design features, etc.).

17.58.050 Number Of Parking Spaces Required:
A.    Off Street Parking Requirements: The city’s off street parking requirements are listed by land use classifications in table 17.58-1 of this section. Except as otherwise specifically stated, the following rules apply to table 17.58-1 of this section:

1.    "Square feet" means "gross square feet" and refers to building area unless otherwise specified.

2.    Where parking spaces are required based on a per employee ratio, this shall be construed to be the total number of employees on the largest working shift.

3.    For the purpose of calculating residential parking requirements, dens, studies, or other similar rooms that may be used as bedrooms shall be considered bedrooms.

4.    Where the number of seats is listed to determine required parking, seats shall be construed to be fixed seats. Where fixed seats provided are either benches or bleachers, such seats shall be construed to be not more than eighteen (18) linear inches for pews and twenty four inches (24") for dining, but in no case shall seating be less than determined as required by the uniform building code.

B.    Shared Parking: The city’s off street parking requirements are listed by land use classifications in table 17.58-1 of this section, however, in certain instances, and upon issuance of a conditional use permit, site conditions may warrant a shared parking arrangement. Where two (2) or more uses have different periods of peak parking demand (e.g., a restaurant and an office) and share a common parking supply, the number of spaces required is reduced. To calculate the reduction in the required number of spaces, the following methods are acceptable:

1.    The methodology provided in the Urban Land Institute publication "Shared Parking" may be used to calculate the reduction. For the base parking ratios (i.e., the parking space ratios required before taking into account sharing of spaces), the requirements of this section shall be used.

2.    The applicant may provide a shared parking study that is acceptable to the review authority. (This methodology may be necessary for uses not covered in the shared parking manual.)

C.    Minimum/Maximum Parking Requirements: Unless off street parking reductions are permitted consistent with section 17.58.060, "Reduction Of Off Street Parking Requirements", of this chapter, the number of off street parking spaces required in table 17.58-1 of this section shall be considered the minimum necessary for each use. In conjunction with discretionary development permits, the designated approving authority may increase these parking requirements if it is determined that these requirements are inadequate for a specific project. By the same token, the designated approving authority may decrease the required parking for a specific use as specified in chapter 17.16, "Permit Requirements", of this title.

D.    Uses Not Listed: The number of parking spaces required for uses not specifically listed in table 17.58-1 of this section shall be determined by the planning director based on common functional, product, or compatibility characteristics and activities, as provided in section 17.26.030, "Similar Uses", of this title.

E.    Calculation/Rounding Of Quantities: When the calculation of the required number of off street parking spaces results in a fraction of a space, the total number of spaces shall be rounded to the nearest whole number <0.49, round down; >0.50, round up).

F.    Mixed Use/Multiple Tenants: Except as otherwise provided in this section, for each separate use on a site with multi-tenants, or a combination of principal uses in anyone facility, the development shall provide the aggregate number of parking spaces for each separate use. Parking for retail commercial shopping centers may include restaurant uses up to the maximum percentage of total site square footage, as described in table 17.58-1A of this section, when the indicated percent of the retail parking ratio is used to calculate the number of parking spaces required. Retail commercial shopping centers are allowed to have up to thirty five percent (35%) of their square footage taken up by restaurant uses when calculating parking with this method.

G.    New Buildings Or Development Projects Without Known Tenants: If the type of tenants that will occupy a nonresidential building are not known at the time of the development entitlement or building permit approval, the amount of parking shall be the minimum number of spaces required by table 17.58-1 of this section for the most intense land use allowed within the underlying zoning district that can reasonably be accommodated within the entire structure/project as determined by the planning director. The designated approving authority may grant exceptions to this rule where the use or other restrictions ensure adequate parking is provided (i.e., rezone agreements).

H.    Tenant Spaces With Multiple Functions: When a tenant of a building has several functions, such as retail and office space, the amount of parking for the tenant shall be calculated as required in table 17.58-1 of this section for the primary use, using the gross floor area of the building.

I.    Tenant Spaces With Accessory Storage: When a tenant has enclosed accessory storage in excess of two thousand (2,000) square feet, the required parking for that portion of the tenant space dedicated to storage shall be calculated as specified in table 17.58-1 of this section for warehousing, storage, and distribution (in addition to the parking requirements for the primary use of the building).

17.62.010 Purpose And Applicability:
This chapter establishes the regulation of signs as a way to:

A.    Encourage creative and innovative approaches to signage within the community that are of high quality design and character and contribute to the overall appearance of the community; and

B.    Encourage signage that is architecturally and cosmetically compatible with the surrounding area; and

C.    Enhance the overall property values in the city by discouraging signage that contributes to the visual clutter of the streetscape, such as oversized signs and excessive temporary signs; and

D.    Enhance aesthetic and traffic safety in the community by minimizing signage information to ensure that signage does not distract motorists, obstruct, or otherwise impede traffic circulation; and

E.    Safeguard and protect the public health, safety, and welfare through appropriate prohibitions, regulations, and controls on the design, location, and maintenance of signage. The standards of this chapter apply to signs in all zoning districts. Only signage specifically authorized by this chapter shall be allowed. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.62.020 Review Of Signs:
A.    Permit Required: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall erect, move, alter, replace, or maintain any sign without first obtaining zoning clearance (administrative plan check) to ensure compliance with applicable provisions of this chapter pursuant to section 17.16.020 of this title. (See section 17.62.030 of this chapter for exemptions.)

B.    Uniform Sign Program: A uniform sign program is intended to integrate design of signs with the design of the structures to achieve a unified architectural statement. Its purpose is ensuring design compatibility, not providing exemptions from the provisions of this chapter.

C.    Applicability: A uniform sign program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exists:

1.    New multi-tenant developments of three (3) or more separate tenants that share either the same parcel or structure and use common access and parking facilities;

2.    Whenever three (3) or more signs are requested by a single tenant in an existing multi-tenant project that is currently not covered by a uniform sign program; or

3.    Whenever the city determines that a uniform sign program is appropriate in order to achieve the objectives of this title.

D.    Approval Of A Uniform Signage Program: The hearing and approving body for all uniform signage programs shall be the planning commission. The process for appealing the decision shall be consistent with section 17.14.060 of this title.

E.    Standards: The uniform sign program shall include criteria for building attached signs for tenants, anchors, freestanding building signs and the integrated development itself to establish consistency of sign type, location, logo and/or letter height, lines of copy, illumination, construction details, and color and materials of signs for the project. All signs within tne development shall be consistent with the USP.

F.    Revisions To A Uniform Signage Program: The planning director may approve revisions to a uniform signage program if the director determines that the modifications are minor in nature and do not change or modify the intent or conditions of the original approval. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval (as determined by the planning director) shall require planning commission approval. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.62.060 General Development, Maintenance, And Removal:
This section describes the standards applied to the development, maintenance, and removal of signs within the city.

A.    Measurement Of Sign Area:

1.    Computation: Sign area shall be computed by means of a single continuous perimeter composed of any rectilinear geometric figure that encloses the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any fixture of similar character, together with any frame or material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such sign from the background against which it is placed; however, if the sign is composed of individual letters or symbols using the wall as the background with no added decoration, the total sign area shall be calculated as seventy five percent (75%) of the area of any rectilinear geometric figure that encloses the extreme limits of the characters or symbols.

2.    Supporting Framework: Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area.

3.    More Than One Sign Face: Signs composed of more than one sign face shall be computed as including only the maximum single display surface that is visible from any ground position at one time.

4.    Three-Dimensional Objects: Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statuelike trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane.

5.    Time And Temperature Devices: For signs that incorporate time and temperature devices, the area of these devices shall not be included in the total area of the sign.

6.    Primary Building Frontage: Where the maximum allowed sign area is based upon the measurement of a building’s primary frontage, the primary frontage shall be the building frontage facing the street. In cases where a building has more than one street frontage, the longest of the street frontages shall be considered the primary building frontage. In cases where a business has no building frontage facing a street, the building frontage with the primary business entrance shall be considered the primary building frontage. A single multi-tenant building has one primary frontage, the allowable sign area for which may be distributed at the discretion of the owner; however, in no event shall the combined sign area for all tenants exceed the allowable sign area for the building.

B.    Measurement Of Sign Height: Sign height shall be measured from the uppermost part of the sign used in determining the area of the sign to the lowest elevation at the base of the sign.

C.    Maintenance Of Signs: All signs shall comply with the following criteria:

1.    All transformers, equipment, programmers, and other related items shall be screened andlor painted to match the building or shall be concealed within the sign;

2.    All permanent signs shall be constructed of quality, low maintenance materials such as metal, concrete, natural stone, glass, and acrylics. Techniques shall be incorporated during construction to reduce fading and damage caused by exposure to sunlight or degradation due to other elements;

3.    All signs shall be constructed in compliance with any applicable building, electrical, or other code in effect at the time of construction or maintenance, with particular respect to wind and seismic loads and overturning moment;

4.    All freestanding signs that incorporate lighting shall have underground utility service;

5.    Signs shall be cleaned, updated, and/or repaired as necessary to maintain an attractive appearance and to ensure safe operation of the sign. Unacceptable sign conditions include broken or missing sign faces, broken or missing letters, chipped or peeling paint, water damage, missing or inoperative lights, exposed mechanical or electrical components, and missing or broken fasteners. Failure to respond to a written request from the city to perform maintenance work shall result in revocation of the sign’s zoning clearance;

6.    All temporary signs and banners shall be made of a material designed to maintain an attractive appearance for as long as the sign is displayed;

7.    All illuminated signs shall be of such intensity or arranged in such a manner so as not to create glare for abutting properties or vehicular traffic.

D.    Illumination Standards: The artificial illumination of signs, either from an internal or external source, shall be designed to eliminate negative impacts on surrounding rights of way and properties. The following standards shall apply to all illuminated signs:

1.    External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of an object other than the sign;

2.    The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will create a negative impact on residential properties in direct line of sight to the sign;

3.    Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness, or color;

4.    Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or construed as traffic control devices;

5.    Reflective type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed fifteen (15) watts shall not be used on the exterior surface of signs so that the face of the bulb or lamp is exposed to a public right of way or adjacent property; and

6.    Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible.

E.    Sign Removal Or Replacement: When a sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other structural elements that support the sign shall also be removed. Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of the structure.

F.    Setback Of Freestanding Signs (Permanent And Temporary): The minimum setback distance for signs shall be measured from back of the public right of way. No sign shall encroach into a public right of way. All freestanding signs shall be set back a minimum of ten feet (10') from the public right of way with the following exception:

1.    Where the public right of way has not been improved to its ultimate width, signs shall be set back from the ultimate right of way as defined by the public works department. Until such time as the right of way is improved to its ultimate width, the applicant may be granted an encroachment permit to allow the sign to be placed within the ultimate right of way, provided that when the right of way is improved the owner of the sign shall be required to remove or otherwise relocate the sign (at their own cost) and shall be subject to the current standards as provided in this title.

G.    Location Of Building Signs: Building signs may be located along any frontage of a building that faces directly onto a public right of way or an internal circulation path of the site. In no instance shall signs face directly onto residential property. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.62.070 Permitted Signs By Type And Development Characteristics:
Signs permitted within the city are regulated by sign and corresponding development type, rather than zoning district, and the standards for their development are described in table 17.62-1 of this section. Zoning clearance (administrative plan check) is required to determine compliance with applicable provisions of this section. Only those signs that may be permitted are listed. The goal of these standards is to regulate permanent signs that have a commercial message so that they comply with the purpose of this chapter, as established in section 17.62.010 of this chapter. Noncommercial signs and signs that are exempt from these standards are described in section 17.62.030 of this chapter. Temporary signs are listed in section 17.62.080 of this chapter. The following general rules/standards apply to permanent signs regulated in this section:

A.    Building signs are those signs that are permanently attached to a building (i.e., wall signs, blade/bracket signs, etc.).

B.    Freestanding signs are those that have their own unique foundation or are otherwise not attached to a building (i.e., monument sign).

C.    The total allowed sign area may be distributed among the maximum number of signs permitted for each sign type.

D.    Illumination standards refer to whether or not the sign may be illuminated and how. Signs that may be illuminated may be done so by "indirect or background" (indirect light source, low wattage spotlight without glare to the adjoining property, or internal light source with opaque, nontransparent background) or by any method that produces "no glare onto (neighboring) residential property".

E.    Allowable sign area is either a set square footage per business or is based on a ratio of sign area to primary building frontage. It is calculated as described in section 17.62.060 of this chapter. Where a ratio is described, it applies up to the listed maximum sign area.

F.    Public frontage is that area of the building that faces onto a public right of way, an internal circulation aisle, or a parking lot. In no case shall signs face directly onto residential property. (See section 17.62.060 of this chapter.)

17.70.010 Purpose And Intent:
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of adult oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented entertainment to their intended market. In addition, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.70.020 Classification:
Adult oriented businesses are classified as follows:

A.    Adult arcades;

A.    Such use is situated more than one thousand feet (1,000') from any other adult oriented business whether in the city, in an adjoining city, or within an unincorporated area.

B.    Such use is located more than five hundred feet (500') from any of the following uses whether in the city, in an adjoining city, or within an unincorporated area:

1.    Land zoned for single-family, duplex or multifamily residences;

2.    Any public or private educational facility including, but not limited to, child daycare facilities, libraries, nursery schools, preschools, kindergartens, elementary schools, private schools, intermediate schools, junior high schools, middle schools, high schools, secondary schools, continuation schools, special education schools. This category of uses does not include vocational or professional institutions of higher education including, but not limited to, community or junior colleges, colleges and universities;

3.    Any public park, or recreational area, or property zoned, planned, or otherwise designated for such use by city action, including, but not limited to, a park, playground, nature trails, swimming pool, athletic field, basketball or tennis courts, or other similar public land within the city which is under the control, operation, or management of the city or park and recreation authorities; or

4.    A church, synagogue, mosque, temple or building or portion of a building or structure which is regularly used for religious worship or related religious activities.

C.    Such use is situated in either an I-L or I-H (industrial) land use zone.

D.    The distance between the adult oriented business and the zone described in subsection B1 or B2 of this section shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest exterior wall of the building or structure in which the adult oriented business is located to the boundary of the property on which the building, structure, or use, or portion of the building, structure, or use, described in subsection B1 or B2 of this section is located.

E.    No more than one classification of adult oriented business shall be permitted within a single structure unless such structure is divided so that the perimeters of the individual adult oriented businesses are separated by more than one thousand feet (1,000) at their closest point. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.70.040 Requirements: Nonconforming Use Based Upon Distance
A.    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17.70.030 of this chapter, the use of land for an adult oriented business which is subject to a distance separation requirement from other specified uses that was legally established, but has been rendered nonconforming as a result of an incompatible use being established within the prescribed distance separation requirement, may continue subject to all of the following restrictions:

1.    Such use shall not be expanded or extended in any way either on the same or adjoining land;

2.    The use, including the classification of adult oriented business, shall not be changed except to a use which conforms to the regulations and zoning applicable to such land;

3.    If such use is discontinued for a period of more than ninety (90) days, it shall not thereafter be reestablished;

4.    If the adult oriented business license, required by section 5.04.020 of this code, for such use is revoked, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished.

B.    The initial conformity of a use shall be determined as of the date a completed application for an adult oriented business license is received by the city for the specified use on the subject property.

C.    The foregoing provisions shall supersede chapter 17.84, "Nonconforming Uses, Buildings And Structures", of this title and shall apply to adult oriented businesses. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.70.050 Other Nonconforming Use:
A.    Any adult oriented business that was lawfully operating on November 2, 2006, or that is lawfully operating on land annexed into the city after November 2, 2006, that is in violation of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming use.

B.    The nonconforming use shall be permitted to continue for a period not exceeding: 1) two (2) years from November 2, 2006, or 2) two (2) years from the date the land is annexed into the city, unless sooner terminated for any reason or voluntarily discontinued for a period of thirty (30) days or more. Such nonconforming use shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use.

C.    The owner or operator of a nonconforming adult oriented business use may apply under the provisions of this section to the planning director for an extension of time within which to terminate the nonconforming use.

1.    An application for an extension of time within which to terminate a use made nonconforming by the provisions of this section may be filed by the owner of the real property upon which such nonconforming adult oriented business use is operated, or by the operator of the use.

17.76.010 Application And Intent:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the development of all residential condominiums and stock cooperatives including the conversion of existing dwelling units to condominiums, row houses, townhouses, and stock cooperatives. The existing stock of rental housing provides the majority of housing opportunities for low and moderate income households. A limited number of such units exist, and any reduction in the stock of such units while there is a shortage would be incompatible with the goals of the housing element of the general plan. Conversion of such units into condominiums often results in displacement of low and moderate income households. It is the intention of this chapter to regulate such conversion and to mitigate displacement where conversion occurs. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.020 Application Content:
No conversion to condominiums shall be accepted or approved when the citywide vacancy rate for multiple unit rental housing, as determined by the planning director, is equal to or less than five percent (5%) averaged over the previous four (4) quarters prior to application submittal or when the current percentage of multi-family rental units (within complexes of 3 or more units) is at or below ten percent (10%) of the total number of housing units within the city. Recognizing that the conversion of existing structures which have been previously occupied and constructed as rental units presents unique problems to present tenants and future buyers, the application for a use permit for a condominium conversion project shall include the following information in addition to that required by chapter 17.16 of this title:

A.    Organizational Documents: The proposed organizational documents, including the covenants, conditions and restrictions to be recorded pursuant to section 1350 et seq., of the Civil Code. The organizational documents shall provide for the following:

1.    Transfer of title to each unit;

2.    Assignment of parking for each owner, and provisions for parking of recreational vehicles;

3.    The management of common areas within the project, and the complex generally;

4.    The antidiscrimination provisions set forth in section 17.76.090 of this chapter; and

5.    Maintenance program and proposed budget.

B.    A Property Report: The property report prepared by an engineer shall describe the condition and structural integrity of the buildings as well as an estimate of the remaining useful life of each of the following elements of each structure situated within the project proposed for conversion: roofs, foundations, exterior paint, insulation, paved surfaces, mechanical systems, electrical systems, plumbing systems, sewage systems, sprinkler systems for landscaping, utility delivery systems, central or community heating and air conditioning systems, fire protection systems including any automatic sprinkler systems, alarm systems, or standpipe systems, structural elements, and drainage systems. The property report shall state what the sound transmission class and sound impact class of the existing floor to ceiling and wall to wall assemblies of sample units are. The report shall also explain, in nontechnical terms, what the class ratings mean and state what measure, if any, the applicant will take to improve sound attenuation between units. The property report shall list each fixed appliance to be contained in each or any unit offered for sale and shall state whether the appliance is or will be new or used when the unit is first offered for sale. The report shall also state the terms and nature of the warranty offered by the applicant on each such appliance. Each portion of the property report shall be prepared by an appropriately licensed engineer.

C.    Pest Control Report: A structural pest control report.

D.    Building History Report: A building history report identifying the date of construction of all elements of the project.

E.    Noncompliance Report: A report identifying all characteristics of the building not in compliance with this code or applicable building or housing codes.

F.    Rental History Report: A rental history report detailing the size, in square footage, of the building or buildings and each unit; the current or last rental rate; the name and address of each present tenant; the monthly rental rate for the preceding three (3) years for each unit; the average monthly vacancy over the preceding three (3) years; the number of evictions over the preceding three (3) years. In addition, evidence shall be submitted that tenants have been notified and have acknowledged the applicant’s intent to file a request for conversion for a period of at least sixty (60) days prior to the initial filing of an application for a conversion use permit or tentative subdivision map. Failure to provide any information required by this subsection shall be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration given under penalty of perjury, setting forth in detail all efforts undertaken to discover the information and all reasons why the information could not be obtained.

G.    Relocation Assistance Information Report: A detailed report describing the relocation and moving assistance information to be given to each tenant, and the steps the applicant will take to ensure the successful relocation of each tenant. The report should state in detail what assistance will be provided for special category tenants, including a discussion of long term or life term leases and provisions to allow such tenants to continue renting after conversion until comparable housing, as defined by subsection 17.76.140C of this chapter, is located and the move can be completed.

H.    Tenant Survey: A survey of all the tenants in the conversion project indicating how long each tenant had been a resident of the project, how long each tenant had planned to live in the project, whether or not each tenant would be interested in purchasing a unit, to which community area would each tenant choose to relocate if the conversion took place and the tenant did not purchase a unit, and the extent of tenant approval in principle of the conversion. This survey shall include an estimate of the sales price for each unit, not including inflation and adjustments that would take place during conversion. To comply with this provision, the applicant shall provide a tenant rights handout and a questionnaire, in a form approved by the city, to each tenant with an envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the city. The questionnaire shall direct the tenant to return the completed form directly to the city of Greenfield planning division.

I.    Additional Information: The planning director may require additional information necessary to assist in evaluating said conversion project in order to make proper findings in accordance with the purposes and objectives set forth in the adopted city general plan, or any specific plan or element thereof in effect at the time of such application. Comparable data as listed below shall include projects with three (3) or more units. Such information may include, but shall not be limited to:

1.    A report comparing the units in the conversion project, as both rentals and ownership units, with housing available within the city;

2.    A report on availability of comparable rental units at similar rental rates remaining within the city, including vacancy rate information;

3.    A report outlining the available low and moderate income housing units (rental and sales housing) within the city. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.030 Ownership Association:
The developer shall submit to the planning director a copy of the maintenance program and proposed budget by a homeowners’ association or other enforceable means to ensure maintenance of common areas, landscaping, private streets, parking areas, and recreational facilities. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.040 Building Code Requirements:
A building proposed for conversion, and each unit within the building, shall comply at a minimum with all applicable building code standards in effect at the time of the last alteration, repair, relocation, or reconstruction of the building, necessitating compliance with the building code, or, if none, at the time of first construction. All converted units shall be retrofitted to the standards required of new residential condominiums as required by the chief building inspector, including energy conservation. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.050 Building Inspection:
After reviewing the property report required pursuant to subsection 17.76.020B of this chapter and after inspecting the structures within the project when deemed necessary, the building official shall identify and make available to the planning commission and city council all items evidenced by such reports or inspection to be in noncompliance with applicable building and housing codes or to be hazardous to the life, health or safety of any occupant of the units within the project or the general public. All such items shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the building official. An appropriate fee to cover the cost of the building inspection division’s review and inspection will be collected. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.060 Consumer Protection Provisions:
In addition to the tenant protection provisions set out in the subdivision map act, the applicant shall comply with the provisions in sections 17.76.070 through 17.76.110 of this chapter, as conditions of any use permit for a condominium conversion project approved pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.070 Sales And Lease Termination:
The tenants of the project on the date of application shall be offered the first right of refusal to purchase units. The offer shall run for ninety (90) days from the date of issuance of subdivision public report by the state department of real estate unless the tenant gives prior written notice of intention not to exercise the right. A tenant of any project proposed for conversion on the date of application for each conversion may terminate any lease after giving thirty (30) days’ notice. The required relocation assistance shall be applicable to all units from the date of final approval of the use permit to the closing of escrow for the final unit in the project. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.080 Relocation Assistance:
The applicant shall offer to each eligible tenant a plan for relocation to comparable housing, as approved by the city council. The relocation plan shall provide, at a minimum, for the following:

A.    Assistance to each eligible tenant in locating comparable housing, including, but not limited to, providing availability reports and transportation, where necessary.

B.    Payment of a relocation fee to each tenant who does not choose to stay. At a minimum, such payment shall be equal in amount to two (2) months’ rent and the security deposit amount paid by the tenant for the existing apartment unit. A tenant is not entitled to a relocation fee pursuant to this subsection if the tenant has been evicted for just cause.

C.    In the case of eligible tenants who are elderly, handicapped, low income, or single heads of households living with one or more minor children, the following additional provisions must be made:

1.    Payment of the first month’s rent in the new complex, and refund of all key, utility, and pet deposits to which the tenant is entitled upon vacating the unit. Cleaning and security deposits, minus damages, shall be refunded to the tenant upon vacating the unit.

2.    If the amount of deposits and other fees required upon moving into the new complex exceeds the amounts refunded to the tenant plus damages, the applicant shall pay the difference.

3.    If the amount of damage to any unit exceeds the deposit, the excess may be subtracted from the relocation assistance payment.

D.    In the case of eligible special category tenants, the following additional provisions must be made:

1.    Subsidy: Where the rent for the comparable unit is higher than the rent for the current unit, the applicant shall pay the difference for a period of one year from the date of relocation.

2.    Evictions: Until each tenant is successfully relocated, the tenant shall not be unjustly evicted.

3.    Life Term And Long Term Leases: The applicant shall offer eligible special category tenants leases for a term of:

a.    Fifty nine (59) years when the tenant is elderly or handicapped and who also qualifies as low income. Such leases shall provide that annual rent increase shall not exceed the percent of change in HUD’s defined fair market rent.

b.    Fifty nine (59) years when the tenant is elderly or handicapped with a moderate income or greater. Rents may be increased at the prevailing market rate.

c.    An annually renewable lease for a term not to exceed five (5) years for low income households when the appropriate authority finds that comparable units are not available for the relocation of low income persons. Such agreements shall be certified for tenant eligibility each calendar year. Qualification for the federal section 8 program or its successor shall constitute certification.

E.    The offer to each eligible tenant of a plan for relocation shall be free of any coercion, intimidation, inducement or promise not herein specified and shall not cause the tenant to vacate in advance of, or prior to, a timetable or schedule for relocation as approved in its application for approval of conversion.

F.    An affordable housing plan subjecting ten percent (10%) of the total units within the project to affordable purchase obligations, without city subsidy, as part of a conversion. The affordable units shall provide a minimum of four percent (4%) of the total units within the project affordable to very low income, four percent (4%) affordable to low income households, and two percent (2%) affordable to moderate income households, unless an alternate affordability breakdown is approved by the planning director. Parcels that have an existing affordable rent component shall convert the affordable rental units to affordable purchase units. In addition, the condominium conversion shall increase the total number of affordable units by a number equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of units within the project. However, the total number of affordable purchase units shall not be less than ten percent (10%) of the total units in a project. The converted and new affordable units shall be provided without city subsidy and shall include a minimum of four percent (4%) affordable to very low income households, four percent (4%) affordable to low income households, and two percent (2%) affordable to moderate income households, unless existing affordability restrictions require a different breakdown of the affordable units or an alternate affordability breakdown is approved by the planning director. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.090 Antidiscrimination:
The applicant or owner of any condominium unit within a project shall not discriminate in the sale, or in the terms and conditions of sale, of any dwelling unit against any person who is or was a lessee or tenant of any such dwelling unit because such person opposed, in any manner, the conversion of such building into a condominium. In a like manner, the applicant or owner shall not discriminate in the sale, or in the terms and conditions of sale of any dwelling unit against any person or household based upon age or household size, when household size does not exceed the uniform housing code standard which states, "Every dwelling unit shall have at least one (1) room which shall have not less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet of floor area. Other habitable rooms, except kitchens, shall have an area of not less than seventy (70) square feet. Where more than two (2) persons occupy a room used for sleeping purposes, the required floor area shall be increased at the rate of fifty (50) square feet for each occupant in excess of two (2) (Uniform Housing Code section 503(b))." This antidiscrimination section shall be included in the conditions, covenants, and restrictions for the project. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.100 Preconversion Protection:
From the date of application for a permit to convert, or until relocation takes place or the application is denied or withdrawn, but in no event for more than two (2) years, no tenant shall be unjustly evicted and no tenant’s rent shall be increased: a) more frequently than once every six (6) months or b) in an amount greater than the annual increase in utility costs and insurance costs, plus increased operating costs not to exceed two percent (2%) per year. This limitation shall not apply if rent increases are expressly provided for in leases or contracts in existence prior to the filing date of the use permit. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.110 Appliance Warranties:
The applicant shall provide free of charge to the first individual purchaser of each unit a one year warranty on each fixed appliance contained in the unit, whether new or used. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.120 Development Standards:
The following development standards (sections 17.76.130 and 17.76.140 of this chapter) shall apply to all applications for a use permit for condominium conversion and new construction. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.130 Utilities:
A.    Gas: Each condominium unit shall have a separate gas service where gas is a necessary utility. If this provision places unreasonable economic burden on the applicant, the appropriate authority may approve an alternative.

B.    Electricity: Each condominium unit shall have a separate electrical service, with separate meters and disconnects, and ground fault interrupters where ground fault interrupters are required by present building codes.

C.    Telephone Company Access: The telephone company serving the location under conversion shall have the right to construct and maintain (place, operate, inspect, repair, replace and remove) communication facilities as it may from time to time require (including access) in or upon any portion of the common area, including the interior and exterior of the buildings as necessary to maintain communication service within the project. This provision may not be amended or terminated without the consent of the serving telephone company. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.140 Findings Required For Approval:
The commission shall not approve a use permit for conversion unless it finds:

A.    That the proposed conversion is consistent with the general plan and applicable community and specific plans in effect at the time of the use permit application, especially with the objectives, policies, and programs of the housing element of the general plan designed to provide affordable housing to all economic segments of the population.

B.    That the average rental vacancy rate in multiplefamily units of similar size in the city affected by the proposed conversion during the four (4) quarters preceding the filing of the application is greater than five percent (5%) and that the current percentage of multi-family rental units (within complexes of 3 or more units) is above ten percent (10%) of the total number of housing units within the city. In evaluating the average rental vacancy rate in the city and in the building proposed for conversion, the commission shall consider the rental history of the building, including the number of evictions and increases in rent over the preceding three (3) years. In addition, the following sources of vacancy rate statistics may be used: 1) department of finance (state of California), 2) postal service, and 3) HUD vacancy rates, if available. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission may deny a use permit if it finds that vacancies in the building have been created by unjust evictions and unreasonable rent increases in order to qualify a project for conversion under this subsection.

C.    That the applicant unconditionally offered to each eligible tenant an adequate plan for relocation to comparable housing. In determining whether the housing to which the applicant proposes relocation is "comparable" the commission must find that the housing is decent, safe, and sanitary, and in compliance with all local and state housing codes: and, that the housing is open to all persons regardless of race, creed, national origin, ancestry, religion, marital status, or gender. In addition, the commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether the relocation housing is comparable:

1.    Whether the housing is provided with facilities equivalent to that provided by the landlord in the dwelling unit in which the tenant then resides in regard to each of the following: a) apartment size including number of rooms; b) rent range: c) major kitchen and bathroom facilities; d) special facilities for the handicapped, infirm or senior citizens; e) willingness to accept families with children:

2.    Whether the housing is located in an area not less desirable than the area in which the tenant then resides in regard to: a) accessibility to the tenant’s place of employment: b) accessibility to community and commercial facilities; c) accessibility to schools; and d) accessibility to public transportation. A unit is not comparable if it is located in a building for which a notice of intent to convert has been given, except where the rental units of the building will not be offered for sale as condominium units within two (2) years. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.150 Lapse Of Use Permit:
An approved conditional use permit, if not used for the purpose for which it was granted, shall lapse three (3) years following the date on which the permit became effective. Since the regulations related to condominium conversions are unique in the following ways: a) measures come into place with the filing of the application for the use permit; b) in terms of the financial obligations related to eligible tenants; and c) rental limitations; the following provision shall apply to use permits for condominium conversions:

A use permit shall be deemed in effect if, within three (3) years from the date of approval, one of the following occurs:

A.    A final subdivision map is recorded for all or a portion of the property involved in the use permit, or

B.    Pursuant to the approved relocation assistance plan, written evidence has been filed with the planning division that more than ten percent (10%) of eligible tenants have been relocated. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.76.160 Right To Terminate Conversion:
Within three (3) years of the approval of a use permit for a condominium conversion or after the use permit is in effect, the applicant may elect not to pursue the completion of all or part of the approved conversion. Upon the acceptance of a notice of termination by the approving authority, along with evidence that all remaining eligible tenants have been notified in writing, the conditional use permit shall be deemed lapsed and void. Acceptance of the notice of termination shall be an administrative authority of the director of planning. Such acceptance shall be by a written notice of acceptance which may be withheld to such time as the director is assured that any required tenant obligations incurred during the preconversion process have been satisfied. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

Sections:

17.78.010    Purpose And Applicability

17.78.020    Permit Requirements

17.78.030    Development Standards

17.78.010 Purpose And Applicability:
The purpose of this chapter is toregulate drive-in/drive-through facilities with development standards to ensure that the design and operation of such uses effectively mitigate associated problems with traffic, congestion, excessive pavement, litter, and noise. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.78.020 Permit Requirements:
Drive-in and drive-through facilities are permitted in the retail business (C-R), highway commercial (C-H), and professional office (P-O) zoning districts with approval of a conditional use permit in conjunction with the required permits for the associated use or development. (Ord. 503 §3, 2014: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.78.030 Development Standards:
The development standards in this section are intended to supplement the standards in the underlying zoning district for drive-in and drive-through uses. In the event of conflict between these standards and the underlying zoning district standards, the provisions of this section shall apply.

A.    Drive-Through Aisles: The minimum standards for drive-through aisles are as follows:

1.    Drive-through aisles shall have a minimum ten foot (10') interior radius at curves and a minimum twelve foot (12') width.

2.    Drive-up windows and remote tellers shall provide at least one hundred eighty feet (180') of stacking space for each facility, as measured from the service window or unit to the entry point into the drive-up lane. Nonfood and/or nonbeverage businesses may reduce the stacking space to a minimum of sixty feet (60').

3.    Each drive-through entrance/exit shall be at least fifty feet (50') from an intersection of public rights of way, measured at the closest intersecting curbs, and at least twenty five feet (25') from the curb cut on an adjacent property. Exceptions may be granted by the designated approving authority when drive-though pullout spaces are provided.

4.    Each entrance to an aisle and the direction of traffic flow shall be clearly designated by signs and pavement markings.

5.    Each drive-through aisle shall be separated from the circulation routes necessary for ingress or egress from the property, or access to a parking space.

6.    Drive-through aisles shall be located a minimum of three hundred feet (300') from a residential zone and one thousand feet (1,000') from a rural residential general plan designation.

B.    Landscaping Of The Drive-Through Aisle: Landscaping shall be provided as described below:

1.    A five foot (5') wide planter between the drivethrough aisle and the parking area that includes shade trees consistent with those used in the parking area. (See chapter 17.54, "Landscaping", of this title.)

2.    A minimum three foot (3'), maximum four foot (4'), tall planter with low shrubs that screens the drivethrough aisles from the abutting public right of way shall be used to minimize the visual impact of reader board signs and directional signs. At no time shall this landscape barrier be pruned in a manner that allows the vehicle headlights from the drive-through lane to be visible from abutting street rights of way. Plantings should also be designed to discourage potential safety issues (i.e., persons lying in wait).

C.    Pedestrian Access And Crossings: Pedestrian access shall be provided from each abutting street to the primary entrance with a continuous four foot (4') wide sidewalk or delineated walkway. Pedestrian walkways should not intersect the drive-through drive aisles, but where they do the walkways shall have clear visibility and shall be delineated by textured and colored paving.

D.    Hours Of Operation: When located on a site within one hundred feet (100') of any residential property (measured from the nearest property lines), hours of operation for the drive-up/drive-through service shall be limited from seven o’clock (7:00) A.M. to ten o’clock (10:00) P.M. daily. If the use is located at a distance greater than one hundred feet (100') from a residential property then the hours of operation may be longer.

E.    Signs: Signs shall be permitted in accordance with provisions of chapter 17.62, "Signs", of this title. Double drive-through aisles shall be restricted to one menu/order board sign.

F.    Parking: The provision of drive-through service facilities shall not justify a reduction in the number of required off street parking spaces for the accompanying use.

G.    Noise: Any drive-up or drive-through speaker system shall emit no more than fifty (50) decibels and at no time shall any speaker system be audible above daytime ambient noise levels beyond the property lines of the site. The system shall be designed to compensate for ambient noise levels in the immediate area and shall not be located within thirty feet (30') of any residential property (measured at the nearest residential property line). (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.80.070    Supportive Housing.

17.80.010 Purpose And Intent.
A.    The California Government Code mandates each local jurisdiction analyze the special housing needs of the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households, families and persons in need of emergency shelter, homeless persons and families, and any other group a local jurisdiction deems appropriate. Special needs are those associated with specific demographic or occupational groups which call for very specific program responses. These special needs groups often live in substandard homes or in overcrowded living conditions, spend a disproportionate amount of their income to secure safe and decent housing, and are sometimes subject to discrimination based on their specific needs or circumstances.

B.    The general plan housing element of the Greenfield 2005 general plan identifies the city’s need to provide equal access to housing for homeless persons, recently homeless persons, single and small households, farmworkers, and other people with special needs, including encouraging the development of emergency, transitional, single-room occupancy, and farmworker housing in proximity to transit and services. The California Government Code establishes certain local government regulatory limits related to the development and approval of emergency shelters and transitional and employee, including farmworker housing facilities.

C.    It is the intent of this chapter to provide for adequate development and operational standards to assure appropriate and affordable housing and services can be accommodated in the city for homeless persons, recently homeless persons, single and small households, farmworkers, and other special needs populations. This chapter shall be interpreted and applied consistent with the policies and guidelines of the general plan housing element, the requirements of the California Government Code, including but not limited to Section 65580 et seq., and the requirements of the California Health and Safety Code Section 17000 et seq. (Ord. 533 §2(part), 2018: Ord. 510 §1(part), 2015: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.80.020 General Requirements.
A.    Licensing Compliance: Emergency shelter, transitional housing, single-room occupancy, employee housing, and other special needs housing facilities shall comply with all federal and California state licensing requirements.

B.    Code Compliance: Emergency shelter, transitional housing, single-room occupancy, employee housing, and other special needs housing facilities shall comply with all applicable uniform building and fire codes, including maximum occupancy restrictions. (Ord. 533 §2(part), 2018: Ord. 510 §1(part), 2015: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.80.030 Emergency Shelters.
A.    Definition: "Emergency shelter" means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six (6) months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.

B.    Permit Requirements: Emergency shelters are permitted in R-M (medium density residential), R-H (high density residential), and C-R (retail business) zoning districts and shall be subject only to those restrictions and standards that apply to other residential or commercial development in the same zoning district, except as otherwise set forth in this section.

1.    Emergency shelters are allowed in the C-R (retail business) zoning district as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.

2.    Emergency shelters are allowed in the R-M (medium density residential) and R-H (high density residential) zoning districts subject to issuance of a conditional use permit.

3.    Notwithstanding subsection B1 of this section, allowance of an emergency shelter of one hundred (100) or more beds in the C-R (retail business) zoning district is subject to issuance of a conditional use permit.

C.    Exemption: The requirements of this section do not apply in situations of city or statewide designated disasters or catastrophic conditions, but only for the duration of the designated disaster or catastrophic condition.

D.    Development And Operational Standards: Emergency shelters shall comply with all standards provided by this section.

1.    Parking: Off-street parking shall be provided based on demonstrated need but shall not require more parking than required for other residential or commercial uses in the same zoning district. Except as otherwise required or allowed by this subsection, the parking requirements of chapter 17.58 shall also apply.

2.    Waiting/Intake Areas: An enclosed or screened waiting/intake area shall be provided on the property. Queuing within the public right-of-way is not permitted.

3.    Living Areas: The facility shall have adequate shower and toilet facilities, laundry facilities including washers and dryers, and secure storage areas for its intended residents. To the greatest extent feasible, facilities shall be provided so that all members of a family may be housed together, regardless of age and gender.

4.    On-Site Management:

NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS, AND STRUCTURES
Sections:

17.84.010    Purpose And Intent

17.84.020    Legal Nonconforming Uses

17.84.030    Legal Nonconforming Structures

17.84.070    Terminology Of Legal Nonconforming situations

17.84.080    Exceptions For Certain Legal Nonconforming Uses

17.84.010 Purpose And Intent:
A.    General: It is the general policy of the city to allow uses, structures or lots that came into existence legally and in conformance with then applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of this title to continue to exist and be put to productive use; however, it is also the policy of the city to bring as many aspects of such situations into conformance with this title as is reasonably practicable. This chapter is intended to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the property but also to preclude the excessive expansion of nonconforming situations and to preclude the reestablishment of an abandoned use or lot or of a nonconforming building or structure that has been substantially destroyed.

B.    Applicability: This chapter shall apply to circumstances that became nonconforming by initial adoption of this title or amendment to this title. It shall also apply to nonconforming situations that were legal nonconforming uses or other situations under a similar provision of previously applicable sections or resolution and that remain nonconforming with one or more provisions of this title.

C.    Continuation Permitted: Any nonconforming use, building, structure, sign or other nonconforming situation which existed lawfully on the date of adoption of this title or which becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to this title, may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Where there is a conflict between two (2) or more provisions of this code or city adopted ordinances or previously approved permits, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.

D.    Determination Of Nonconforming Status: The burden of establishing that any nonconforming situation is a "legal nonconforming situation" as defined by this title shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such nonconformity, and not upon the city or any other person.

E.    Effect Of Public Acquisition: If a tract of land which conforms to this title is rendered nonconforming, or if a legal nonconforming lot is made more nonconforming by the acquisition of a portion of said tract or lot for public purposes by any public agency, said tract shall have the status of a legal nonconforming lot. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.020 Legal Nonconforming Uses:
A.    Generally: The lawful use of any building or land existing at the time of the enactment of this title may be continued, although such use does not conform with the provisions of this title, except as provided in this section.

B.    Nonconforming Livestock Uses:

1.    The keeping and maintaining of livestock (including horses, cattle, swine, sheep and goats) may be permitted only on a lot on which, as of the effective date hereof, uses not allowed in the subject zoning district are being conducted pursuant to a legal nonconforming use, in accordance with this section.

2.    Livestock shall only be kept in association with a legal nonconforming use that is residential or agricultural in nature.

3.    The subject parcel on which such legal nonconforming livestock uses are allowed shall not contain less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of gross area and shall include not less than five thousand (5,000) contiguous square feet of unimproved land.

4.    All parcels on which swine are being kept shall contain not less than ten thousand (10,000) contiguous square feet of unimproved land.

5.    All animal units as described in subsection C3 of this section shall be kept a minimum of fifty feet (50') from all abutting residential property lines.

C.    Expansion Or Enlargement Of Use:

1.    Expansion or enlargement of a permitted use in the applicable district shall not require that nonconforming uses on the subject parcel be brought into conformance with the regulations of that zoning district.

2.    A legal nonconforming use may be expanded by up to twenty five percent (25%) (measured in gross square footage occupied) through approval of a use permit (chapter 17.16 of this title) and provided that all off site improvements, as identified by the city, be constructed by the applicant, in accordance with all city standards and requirements. A legal nonconforming use shall not otherwise be expanded or enlarged unless required by law or by ordinance.

3.    Expansion or enlargement of nonconforming livestock uses shall be permitted without a use permit up to a maximum of ten (10) animal units per each acre, defined as follows:

Animal

Shall Equal

1 animal unit

1 bovine (cow)

1 swine (pig)

2 sheep

2 goats

2 miniature horses

10 chickens

4.    Any request for expansion or enlargement of nonconforming livestock uses that will result in an increase in the gross square footage occupied by the use (calculated at a maximum of 10 animal units per acre) shall require the issuance of a use permit, in accordance with chapter 17.16 of this title.

a.    The attachment of signs to the building, the placement of signs or display materials on land outside of a building, or the attachment of racks, balconies or other projections from the building shall be considered as an extension of the use of a building.

b.    No legal nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a conforming use.

D.    Alterations: A building used for a legal nonconforming use may not be reconstructed or structurally altered during its life to an extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost unless the building is changed to a conforming use; provided, however, that application may be made to the planning commission for a use permit to reestablish the nonconforming identity pursuant to this chapter, based on the general requirement that the subject request for reconstruction or structural alteration renders a genuine service to the area and is in the best interest of the public health, safety and general welfare.

E.    Restoration:

1.    A building used for a legal nonconforming use damaged by fire or other natural causes to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost shall only be repaired or rebuilt in conformity with the regulations of title 15, "Buildings And Construction", of this code; provided, however, that application may be made to the planning commission for a use permit to repair or rebuild a nonconforming use in conformance with all of the other respective district regulations, based on the general requirement that the subject request renders a genuine service to the area and is in the best interest of the public health, safety and general welfare.

2.    If a legal nonconforming building or portion thereof may be restored under the provisions of this section, such restoration must commence within six (6) months of the damage by fire or other natural causes, and must be completed according to such plans as filed within an additional six (6) months.

F.    Changes In Use: No legal nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use. Once changed to a conforming use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.

G.    District Changes: Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another district, the provisions of this section shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.030 Legal Nonconforming Structures:
A.    Use Permitted: A legal nonconforming structure may be used for any permitted use in the applicable district or for any legally nonconforming use in the district in which the structure is located.

B.    Expansion Or Enlargement Of Structure: A legal nonconforming structure may be expanded or enlarged by up to twenty five percent (25%) (measured in gross building square footage) through approval of a use permit (chapter 17.16 of this title) and provided that all off site improvements, as identified by the city, be constructed by the applicant, in accordance with all city standards and requirements. A legal nonconforming structure shall not otherwise be extended or enlarged, unless required by law or by ordinance. Garages legally built prior to the implementation of this code and not meeting size or setback standards are not considered nonconforming.

C.    Moving Prohibited: A legal nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any other parcel unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved.

D.    Maintenance, Repairs And Remodeling: Maintenance and repairs of a legal nonconforming structure shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost. Remodeling of the structure within the existing building footprint is permitted without a variance, provided that the remodeling does not increase the degree of nonconformity and that applicable building and life safety codes are met.

E.    Repair Of Unsafe Structures: Any legal nonconforming structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by the building official may be restored to a safe condition not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost.

F.    Restoration: A legal nonconforming structure damaged by fire or other natural causes to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost shall not be repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of title 15, "Buildings And Construction", of this code, and those of the district in which it is located, or be removed completely within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the damage or destruction. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.040 Legal Nonconforming Lots:
A.    Use Permitted: A legal nonconforming lot may be used for any permitted use in the applicable district or for any legally nonconforming use in the district in which the lot is located.

B.    Merger: Where two (2) or more lots that are legally nonconforming as to area are under common ownership on the effective date of this section, such lots shall be deemed merged for purposes of this section to the extent necessary to create one or more lots that conform to the area requirements of the applicable district.

C.    Replatting: Legal nonconforming lots that have access only to a platted, but unconstructed, street shall not be protected by this section. Owners of such lots shall replat such lots in conformity with the subdivision regulations of title 16 of this code and the applicable zoning regulations of this title before seeking a building permit or otherwise seeking to use one or more of such lots.

D.    Choice Of Uses: Where a legal nonconforming lot or parcel is conforming for some uses in the applicable district but not for others, such lot shall be used for one of the uses for which it conforms to the requirements of the applicable district. If a lot fails to conform to the applicable requirements of the district, then protection of its legal nonconforming status under this section shall extend only to those permitted uses in that district requiring the smallest minimum lot size, which, in most cases, will be a single-family dwelling. Garages built legally prior to the implementation of this code and not meeting size or setback standards are not considered nonconforming. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.050 Legal Nonconforming Signs:
Legal nonconforming signs may be maintained but may not be enlarged or structurally altered. If a legal nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed to the extent that the cost of repair is equal to fifty percent (50%) or more of the cost of replacement, the sign shall be rebuilt or repaired in full conformance with the requirements of the applicable sign regulations of chapter 17.62 of this title or be removed completely within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the damage. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.060 Other Legal Nonconforming Situations:
Continuance of other legal nonconforming situations will be tolerated but not encouraged. To the maximum extent practicable within the boundaries of the property controlled by the same owner, other legal nonconforming situations shall be brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter on the earlier of any date established for such conformance by any requirement of this chapter or upon the application of the owner for any building permit, subdivision approval or other permit or approval required from the city for the continued or additional use or further development of the property on which the legal nonconforming situation is located. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.070 Terminology Of Legal Nonconforming Situations:
A.    Termination By Abandonment: Discontinuance of a legal nonconforming use for a period of more than six (6) months shall be deemed to be abandonment of such use, regardless of intent. Such use shall not then be reestablished, and any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located.

B.    Termination By Damage Or Destruction: In the event that any legal nonconforming structure or use is destroyed by any means to the extent of fifty percent (50%) of the cost of replacement of such structure or use, said structure or use shall be rebuilt, restored, reestablished or reoccupied in conformance with the regulations of title 15, "Buildings And Construction", of this code, and those of the district in which it is located, or be removed completely within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the damage or destruction.

C.    Termination Or Improvement Required By Modification: In acting on any application for any permit or entitlement related to the use or development of land, the building official shall require or ensure that:

1.    Any legal nonconforming use be limited to the existing area of the structure or changed to a conforming use;

2.    The extent of nonconformity of a legal nonconforming structure not be increased;

3.    The applicant complete any necessary lot merger or replatting for a legal nonconforming lot, in accordance with the requirements of the subdivision regulations;

Any other legal nonconforming situation, including off street parking, off street loading, landscaping, or other site improvements, be brought into full conformance with the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent practicable within the property owned or controlled by the owner of the property on which the legal nonconforming situation exists. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.84.080 Exceptions For Certain Legal Nonconforming Uses:
A.    Policy: Certain public, quasi-public, semipublic and institutional uses currently exist as nonconforming uses in the city. Because of the substantial investment in such uses, the public interest in the maintenance of such uses as modern, functional facilities, the lack of vacant land for the relocation of such uses in the developed portions of the city, and the enormous public and private cost involved in relocating such uses, the city council and mayor have determined that it is in the public interest to provide limited exceptions for these facilities from the application of this chapter and, in particular, its provisions for nonconforming uses.

B.    Existing Public And Semipublic Facilities: Existing public and governmental uses may continue to be operated and maintained in any residential or commercial district and may be expanded provided such expansion can be accomplished in accordance with the applicable district regulations or when such expansion is so authorized by the planning commission. No new facility may be established except when permitted in the applicable district or when approved as a use permit in accordance with chapter 17.16 of this title.

C.    Existing Cemeteries: Cemeteries and their structures and appurtenances accessory thereto existing on the effective date of this chapter, as well as the use thereof, may be maintained, structurally altered, enlarged or extended within the existing boundaries of such cemeteries, subject to approval of a use permit.

17.88.010 Purpose.
A.    The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for review of residential care homes and facilities, including those providing housing and supportive services for disabled individuals and households, in compliance with state law. "Residential care facility" means any family home, group care facility, or similar facility that is maintained and operated to provide twenty-four (24) hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual. "Disabled households" includes households containing persons that are disabled because of a physical disability or because of an intellectual, mental, or developmental disability. Residential care homes and facilities provide a cost-effective, supportive, and noninstitutional environment for state-licensed operations. In order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to preserve and protect the integrity of residential neighborhoods, and to ensure this code does not act as a disincentive to or unreasonably restrict the development of residential care homes, including, but not limited to, group homes, elderly care facilities, adult residential facilities, disabled care facilities, foster homes, juvenile court residential facilities for abused or neglected children, and other facilities licensed by the state, residential care facilities shall be allowed and developed in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter. This chapter shall be interpreted and applied consistent with the policies and guidelines of the general plan housing element, the requirements of the California Government Code, including but not limited to Section 65580 et seq., and the requirements of the California Health and Safety Code Section 1500 et seq.

B.    As used in this chapter, "juvenile court residential facilities" do not include any juvenile placement facility approved by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice, any juvenile hall operated by a county, or any place in which a juvenile is judicially placed pursuant to California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 727(a).

C.    As used in this chapter, "residential care facilities" do not include and this chapter does not apply to any independent living arrangement, transitional housing, or supportive housing. For transitional housing or supportive housing, the requirements of sections 17.80.040 and 17.80.070, respectively, shall apply. (Ord. 533 §2(part), 2018: Ord. 473 §3, 2007).

17.88.020 Permit Requirements.
A.    Residential care facilities shall be considered a residential use of property, and, except as otherwise set forth in this chapter, shall be subject only to those restrictions and standards that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zoning district.

B.

17.94.080    Effects Of Development

17.94.010 Purpose And Intent:
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the installation of antennas and other wireless communication facilities consistent with federal law. The city acknowledges the community benefit associated with the provision of wireless communication service and potential public benefit from leasing of publicly owned properties. It is also recognized that unrestricted installations are contrary to the city’s efforts to promote safety and aesthetic considerations. It is not the intent of this chapter to unreasonably limit the reception or transmission of signals or to add excessive permit costs. Rather, it is the intent of this chapter to permit antennas and wireless communication facilities where they can be installed without creating adverse economic, safety and aesthetic impacts on abutting and nearby properties and the overall community. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.94.020 Permit Requirements And Exceptions:
A.    Permit Required: Unless exempt from permit requirements pursuant to section 17.94.030, "Exemptions", of this chapter, all wireless communication facilities require a conditional use permit pursuant to section 17.16.060 of this title. A collocation facility shall be a permitted use not subject to a city or county discretionary permit if is satisfies the requirements set forth in California Government Code 65850.6.

B.    Permit Processing: Permits shall be processed in accordance with applicable provisions of division II of this title.

C.    Permit Fees: Any permit fee imposed by a city, including a chartered city, a county, or a city and county, for the placement, installation, repair, or upgrading of telecommunications facilities such as lines, poles, or antennas by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required authorizations to provide telecommunications services from the public utilities commission and the federal communications commission, shall not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged and shall not be levied for general revenue purposes pursuant to section 50030 of the California Government Code.

D.    Conditions: The designated approving authority for each of the listed permits may impose conditions on the wireless communication facility applications to ensure compliance with all provisions and purposes of this chapter. While, as a condition of approval of an application for a permit for construction or reconstruction for a development project for a "wireless telecommunications facility", as defined in section 17.98.020 of this title, a city or county shall not do any of the following, pursuant to section 65964 of the California Government Code:

1.    Require an escrow deposit for removal of a wireless telecommunications facility or any component thereof. However, a performance bond or other surety or another form of security may be required, so long as the amount of the bond security is rationally related to the cost of removal. In establishing the amount of the security, the city or county shall take into consideration information provided by the permit applicant regarding the cost of removal.

2.    Unreasonably limit the duration of any permit for a wireless telecommunications facility. Limits of less than ten (10) years are presumed to be unreasonable absent public safety reasons or substantial land use reasons. However, cities and counties may establish a build out period for a site.

3.    Require that all wireless telecommunications facilities be limited to sites owned by particular parties within the jurisdiction of the city or county.

E.    Findings For Denial: Findings to deny any permit for a wireless communication facility as regulated herein shall be done in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in the written record. Denial shall not be based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions that comply with the federal communication commission emission regulation. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.94.030 Exemptions:
The following wireless communication facilities are exempt from the requirements of this chapter as specified below and are subject to compliance with other provisions of this title:

A.    A wireless communication facility shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter if and to the extent that a permit issued by the California public utilities commission (CPUC) or the rules and regulations of the federal communication commission (FCC) specifically provide that the antenna is exempt from local regulation.

B.    Satellite earth station (SES) antennas, which are two meters (2 m) (6.5616 feet) or less in diameter or in diagonal measurement, located in any nonresidential zoning district. In order to avoid the creation of an attractive nuisance, reduce accidental tripping hazards and maximize stability of the structure, such antennas shall be placed whenever possible on top of buildings and as far away as possible from the edges of rooftops.

C.    Parabolic antennas, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) antennas and multipoint distribution service (MDSI antennas, which are one meter (1 ml (3.2808 feet) or less in diameter or diagonal measurement and television broadcast service (TVBS) antennas, so long as said antennas are located entirely on private property and are not located within the required front yard setback area. This locational requirement is necessary to ensure that such antenna installations do not become attractive nuisances and/or result in accidental tripping hazards if located adjacent to a street or other public right of way.

D.    Amateur radio antenna structures provide a valuable and essential telecommunication service during periods of natural disasters and other emergency conditions and are therefore exempt from permit provisions of this chapter in compliance with the following standards:

1.    Height Limits: In residential zoning districts, the height limit is forty five feet (45') and in nonresidential zoning districts, the height limit is sixty feet (60'). However, amateur radio antennas in any district may extend to a maximum height of seventy five feet (75'), provided that the tower is equipped with a lowering device (motorized and/or mechanical) capable of lowering the antenna to the maximum permitted height when not in operation.

2.    Location Parameters: All antenna structures shall be located outside of required front and street side yard areas. Antenna structures shall also be set back a minimum distance of five feet (5') from interior property lines. If any portion of the antenna overhangs any property line, a design review permit is required to obtain the authorized signature of all affected property owners on the required application form.

3.    Tower Safety: All antennas shall be located within an enclosed fenced area or have a minimum five foot (5') high tower shield at the tower base to prevent climbing. All active elements of antennas shall have a minimum vertical clearance of eight feet (8').

4.    Modifications: Minor modifications (emergency or routine) provided there is little or no change in the visual appearance as determined by the planning director. (Ord. 473 §3, 2007)

17.94.040 Development Standards:
A.    General Development Standards: Unless otherwise exempt pursuant to section 17.94.030, "Exemptions", of this chapter, the following general development standards shall apply to all wireless communication facilities:

1.    All wireless communication facilities shall comply with all applicable requirements of the current uniform codes as adopted by the city and shall be consistent with the general plan, this title, as well as other standards and guidelines adopted by the city.

2.    All conditional use permit applications for wireless communication facilities shall include a description of services proposed and documentation certifying applicable licenses or other approvals required by the federal communications commission to provide services proposed in connection with the application.

3.    All conditional use permit applications for wireless communications facilities shall include a map and narrative description of all telecommunication sites existing, proposed or planned by the applicant in the city and within a one mile radius of the city border. Such applications shall also include an analysis of all reasonable and technically feasible alternative locations and/or facilities (including collocations) which could provide the proposed communication service.

4.    All conditional use permit applications for wireless communication facilities shall include a propagation map. The propagation map will identify the existing coverage area and the proposed coverage area for the new wireless facility.

5.    To minimize the overall visual impact, new wireless communication facilities shall be collocated with existing facilities, with other planned new facilities, and with other facilities such as water tanks, light standards, and other utility structures whenever feasible and aesthetically desirable. To facilitate collocation when deemed appropriate, conditions of approval for conditional use permits shall require all service providers to cooperate in the siting of equipment and antennas to accommodate the maximum number of operators at a given site when found to be feasible and aesthetically desirable. The applicant shall agree to allow future collocation of additional antennas and shall not enter into an exclusive lease for the use of the site.

6.    At least ten feet (10') of horizontal clearance shall be maintained between any part of the antenna and any power lines unless the antenna is installed to be an integral part of a utility tower or facility.

7.    Development standards for antennas (excluding amateur radio antennas). Unless otherwise exempt pursuant to section 17.94.030, "Exemptions", of this chapter, the following development standards shall apply to receive only antennas (ground and building mounted), parabolic antennas, and satellite earth stations as defined in division VI, "Zoning Definitions", of this title:

a.    Maximum Number: One wireless facility per parcel, unless the applicant can demonstrate the service need for additional antenna.

b.    Antenna Location: Parabolic antenna and satellite earth stations shall be ground mounted in residential zoning districts. In all nonresidential zoning districts, the preference is for building mounted antenna. No antenna shall be located in the required front or street side yard of any parcel unless entirely screened from pedestrian view of the abutting street rights of way (excluding alleys). In all zoning districts, ground mounted antennas shall be situated as close to the ground as possible to reduce visual impact without compromising their function and all portions of the structure/antenna shall be set back a minimum of five feet (5') from any property line.

c.    Height Limit: The height limit for ground mounted antenna is six feet (6'). However, the height may be increased to a maximum of twelve feet (12') if the setback distance from all property lines is at least equal to the height of the antenna and if the structure is screened in accordance with subsection A7d, "Screening", of this section. Building mounted antenna shall not extend above the roofline, parapet wall, or other roof screen or project beyond a maximum of eighteen inches (18") from the face of the building or other support structure.

d.    Screening: Ground mounted antenna shall be screened with a fence, wall or dense landscaping so that the antenna is not visible from the public right of way and to minimize the visual impact on abutting properties. Building mounted antenna shall be screened as follows:

(1)    Wall mounted equipment shall be flush mounted and painted or finished to match to building with concealed cables.

(2)    Roof mounted equipment shall be screened from view of public rights of way by locating the antenna below the roofline, parapet wall, or other roof screen and by locating the antenna as far away as physically feasible and aesthetically desirable from the edge of the building.

In an attendance area where the city council has concurred, as provided in Chapter 18.08, that overcrowding exists, the applicant seeking approval of a proposed residential development, as a condition of such approval or as a condition for the obtaining of a building permit, shall pay fees, make an equivalent arrangement in lieu thereof, dedicate land, dedicate facilities, or do a combination thereof, unless excepted as provided in subsection B of Section 18.08.040 in accordance with findings made by the decisionmaking body during the hearings and other proceedings on said application. Prior to the imposition of fees, the dedication of land, the dedication of facilities, or a combination thereof, it shall be necessary for the decisionmaking body to make the following determinations:

A.    That the land or fees, or both, transferred to a school district shall be used only for the purpose of providing interim elementary or high school classroom and related facilities;

B.    That the facilities to be constructed, purchased, leased or rented from such fees or the land or facilities to be dedicated, or a combination thereof, are consistent with the general plan. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.020 Payment of fees in small residential developments.
Only the payment of fees shall be required in subdivisions containing fifty units, or less. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

At the conclusion of the fifth school year the builder shall, at the builder’s expense, remove the interim facilities from such place. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.040 Standards for imposition of requirements:
Any requirement imposed pursuant to this title shall bear a reasonable relationship and will be limited to the needs of the community for interim elementary or high school facilities and shall be reasonably related and limited to the need for schools caused by the development; provided, the fees shall not exceed the amount necessary to pay five annual lease payments for the interim facilities. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

B.    Three hundred fifty dollars for each dwelling unit, space, or lot in a mobile home park;

C.    No fee shall be charged for any residential unit, regardless of the number of bedrooms, which is within a planned development designed expressly for, and occupied exclusively by, persons who have attained the age of sixty years; provided, however, that if at any time such a housing development, or any part thereof, is converted to regular housing without an age requirement, then upon such conversion all dwelling units within the development shall be subject to payment of the fees provided for in this section;

D.    Except as otherwise provided in subdivision B of this section, no fee shall be charged for any residential unit having only one bedroom; provided, however, that if at any time such unit is added to, remodeled or reconstructed to contain more than one bedroom, it thereupon shall be subject to payment of the fees provided for in this section. The above fees may from time to time be adjusted by resolution of the city council to reflect fluctuations in the cost of providing the school facilities. (Ord. 308 §1, 1985: Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.060 Amount of land to be dedicated.
The total land area required to be dedicated pursuant to this chapter shall be at least equal in monetary value to the fees which otherwise would be payable under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.070 Payment of fees:
If the payment of a fee is required, such payment shall be made at the time the building permit is approved and issued. Fees shall be held in trust by the city until transferred to the affected school district or districts. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.100 Use of fees, land, and facilities.
All fees, land, and facilities required under the provisions of this chapter which have been transferred to a school district shall be used by the district only for the purpose of providing interim elementary or high school classroom and related facilities, and each such transfer shall be made subject to that express condition. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.110 Agreement for fee distribution:
If two separate school districts operate schools in an attendance area where the city council concurs that overcrowding conditions exist for both school districts, the city council shall enter into an agreement with the governing body of each school district for the purpose of determining the distribution of revenues from the fees levied pursuant to this chapter. Until such agreement is reached, the city shall continue to hold the fees in trust pursuant to Section 18.10.070. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.120 Accounting and reports by school districts:
Any school district receiving funds pursuant to this title shall maintain a separate account for any fees paid to it, or funds realized by it from the disposition of land or facilities received, and shall file a report with the city council on the balance in the account at the end of the previous fiscal year and the facilities leased, purchased, or constructed during the previous fiscal year. In addition, the report shall specify which attendance area will continue to be overcrowded when the fall term begins and where conditions of overcrowding wiil no longer exist. Such report shall be filed by August first of each year and shall be filed more frequently at the request of the city council. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

18.10.130 Termination of dedication or fee requirements:
When it is determined by the city council that conditions of overcrowding no longer exist in an attendance area, the decisionmaking body shall cease levying any fee or requiring the dedication of any land or facilities pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 242 §1(part), 1981).

19.08.010 Purpose:
City council finds, based upon the analysis and projections contained in the general plan, the "Police Capital Facilities Mitigation Analysis" prepared by the Abbey Group, Inc., dated April 1989, the "Law Enforcement Facilities, Vehicles And Equipment Development Fee Calculation Report" prepared by Revenue and Cost Specialists, LLC, dated January 2001, and upon other relevant evidence received and considered by it, that the cumulative impact of all new residential, commercial, and industrial development under the general plan will result in unacceptable decreases in access to police facilities. To prevent these undesirable consequences, police facilities must he provided at a rate which will accommodate the expected residential growth in the city. The city council acknowledges that the demand for police facilities is shared by new development as well as existing development. The police facilities fee apportions the cost of the necessary police facilities among the different categories of new and existing users according to the reasonably estimated demand that each group of users places upon police facilities. (Ord. 426 §2, 2001)

19.08.020 Terms And Definitions:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this section:

A.    "Developer" means an individual or entity submitting an application for a building permit or other entitlement for development.

B.    "Development" means:

1.    A new residential unit, including conversion of an existing unit to more than one unit. A residential unit includes single-family detached units, single-family attached units, multiple-family units, mobile home units and commercial lodging units also known as transient occupancy uses.

2.    Commercial, office, retail or industrial uses.

C.    "Future growth" means the total amount of potential new development in the city permitted under the general plan. Future growth is expressed in terms of the number and type of dwelling units for residential development and the gross square footage for industrial, commercial, retail and office uses.

D.    "Police facilities" means those improvements necessary to provide space to provide law enforcement staffing, including the equipment and vehicles required for emergency public safety responses and other law enforcement functions identified in the "Law Enforcement Facilities, Vehicles And Equipment Development Fee Calculation Report" dated January 2001, and other improvements in connection therewith, as may be determined by the city council from time to time, which are not otherwise provided by, or required of, development within the city pursuant to title 16, "Subdivisions", 17, "Zoning", or 15, "Buildings And Construction", of this code. Police facilities shall also include architectural, administrative, legal, planning, environmental and other services required in connection with the implementation of this chapter and the construction and acquisition of the foregoing improvements.

C.    The developer shall be notified in writing of the city manager’s determination about the type of land use and the fee applicable to the development. Such determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of the city manager’s receipt of the developer’s request for the city manager’s determination. The developer may appeal the determination of the city manager to the city council in accordance with the provisions of section 19.08.090 of this chapter. (Ord. 426 §2, 2001)

Unless a development or other agreement provides otherwise, the following developments shall be exempt, in whole or in part, from the police facilities fee otherwise required by this chapter:

A.    Residential development consisting of the repair or replacement of a residential unit, on a one to one basis.

B.    Commercial, office, or industrial development consisting of the repair or replacement of structures, provided that such repair or replacement does not result in any conversion or change in land use, or any enlargement of gross floor area beyond that of the previous structure. (Ord. 426 §2, 2001)

19.08.080 Use Of Funds:
The fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall, except for temporary investments, be placed in a separate fund in a manner to avoid commingling of the fees with other revenues or funds of the city, and shall be used solely for the purpose of acquiring and constructing the police facilities identified by the city council in the "Law Enforcement, Vehicles And Equipment Development Impact Fee Calculation Report" dated January 2001, or police facilities included in the city’s capital improvement plan.

19.08.100 Supplementary Provisions:
It is the intent of the city council that the fees required by this chapter shall be supplementary to the fees, dedications or conditions imposed upon the development pursuant to the provisions of the subdivision map act, California environmental quality act, and other state laws and city ordinances, policies or conditions which may authorize the imposition of fees, dedications or conditions thereon. (Ord. 426 §2, 2001)

19.08.110 Severability:
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any person, association, corporation or to any property as to whom or which it is beyond the power of the city to impose the fee provided in this chapter. If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any fee imposed upon any person or entity is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter, or its effect on other persons or entities. It is declared to be the intention of the city council that this chapter would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal, invalid sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter not been included herein, or had such person or entity been expressly exempted from the application of this chapter. To this end, the provisions of this chapter are severable. (Ord. 426 §2, 2001)

19.08.120 Time Limitation For Judicial Review:

19.10.010 Purpose:
The purpose of the fees imposed under this chapter is to finance the acquisition and construction of street improvements made necessary by new residential, commercial and industrial developments in the city. (Ord. 352 §1, 1990)

19.10.020 Findings:
The city council finds, based upon the circulation element of the Greenfield 2005-2025 general plan, the 2008 AMBAG forecast, the 2010 Citywide Travel Demand Forecasting Model Development Report, and the traffic impact fee program study prepared by Wood Rodgers, Inc., civil and traffic engineers, and upon other relevant evidence received and considered by it, as follows:

A.    New development occurring within the city will increase traffic congestion on streets within the city.

B.    The traffic impacts of such new development are not limited to the immediate vicinity of the new development but require certain street improvements throughout the city.

C.    In order to ensure that new development contributes toward offsetting the burden it imposes upon the city’s traffic system, it is necessary that an equitable fee and administrative program be established.

D.    The facts and evidence presented in the traffic impact fee program study establish the following: 1) that there is a reasonable relationship between the respective uses of such fees and the types of development for which such fees are charged; 2) that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the street improvements and the type of development project on which such fees are imposed; and 3) there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the street improvements or portion of the improvements attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed.

E.    The cost estimates set forth in the traffic impact fee program study are reasonable estimates of the costs to be incurred by the city in acquiring or constructing the needed street improvements, and the fees expected to be generated by new developments under this chapter will not exceed the total of these costs. (Ord. 497 §1, 2012; Ord. 467 §1, 2007: Ord. 418 §§1, 2, 3, 2000: Ord. 352 §1, 1990).

19.10.030 Definitions:
For purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases are defined, and certain provisions shall be construed, as set forth in this section, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended.

A.    "New development" includes:

1.    New construction which generates additional traffic impacts to those generated by the previous use of the land;

2.    Conversion of one use to a new use when the new use generates an additional traffic impact;

3.    Expansion of an existing use;

4.    Any use when conditions imposed by a discretionary permit require payment of a traffic impact fee.

B.    "Off site" means anything outside of and not adjacent to the boundaries of a development.

C.    "Street improvements" includes transportation, planning, preliminary engineering, environmental impact reports, engineering design studies, land surveys, right of way acquisitions, engineering, issuance of permits and construction of all the necessary features for any street construction project, including, without limitation:

1.    Construction of new streets;

2.    Construction of new through lanes;

3.    Construction of new turn lanes;

4.    Construction of new bridges;

5.    Construction of new drainage facilities in conjunction with street or bridge construction or improvement;

7.    Construction of curbs, medians and shoulders;

8.    All street and intersection capacity enhancements, including extensions, widening, intersection improvements and improvement of pavement conditions; and

9.    Traffic signing and striping. (Ord. 352 §1, 1990)

19.10.040 Transportation Program:
(Rep. by Ord. 467 §2, 2007)

19.10.050 Applicability:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new residential, commercial, industrial and other developments in the city, including mobile or manufactured housing, with or without a permanent foundation, except: a) new development for which a building permit was issued prior to the effective date hereof, and b) new development for which a use permit has been issued prior to said effective date, unless the use permit specifically requires the payment of traffic impact fees. (Ord. 352 §1, 1990)

19.10.060 Traffic Fee Imposed:
A.    Pursuant to the findings contained in this chapter, a traffic impact fee is hereby imposed upon each new residential, commercial, industrial and other development in the city, according to the following schedule:

Use Category

Mitigation Fee

Single-family residential

$4,326 per dwelling unit

Multifamily residential

$2,920 per dwelling unit

Mobile homes

$1,225 per dwelling unit

Motel/hotel

$3,173 per thousand square feet

Retail commercial

$17,241 per thousand square feet

Office

$3,983 per thousand square feet

Industrial

$1,772 per thousand square feet

Per "daily trip" basis

$241 per daily vehicle trip

B.    The fee levels established shall be adjusted annually in accordance with the most current "Engineering News Record" construction cost index. Annual changes shall be effective on July 1 of each year, based on the index change for the twelve (12) months ending on December 31 of the previous year. (Ord. 497 §2, 2012; Ord. 418 §5, 2000: Ord. 352 §1, 1990).

19.10.070 Deposit And Use Of Fees:
Fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a special fund which is created and established for the purposes set forth in section 19.10.010, to be known as the "traffic impact fee fund." Monies deposited in said account shall not be commingled with the general fund or other revenues of the city, with the exception of short term investments. Monies deposited in said fund, and all interest accruing thereon, shall be used only to finance "street improvements" as defined in section 19.10.030C. Said street improvements are identified in the traffic impact fee program study prepared by Wood Rodgers, Inc. (Ord. 497 §3, 2012: Ord. 467 §3, 2007: Ord. 352 §1, 1990).

19.10.080 Collection Of Fees:
Traffic impact fees shall be collected on a citywide basis for any new development and for any conversion of use or expansion of existing development, regardless of the character of the development. Changes in existing uses within shopping centers will be exempt from fee indexing, provided they are tenants of a complex under single ownership. Changes in land use will require fee indexing only when a building permit is required. Fees shall be based upon the following:

A.    The amount of the fee shall be set by resolution for each land use as set forth in section 19.10.060 of this chapter.

B.    If a developer constructs traffic control or street improvements or dedicates right of way in excess of the requirements of his or her development for a project contained in the traffic study, the city may accept said construction and/or dedication as an alternative to payment of all or part of the traffic fees payable by said developer. Such alternative means of complying with the traffic fee requirements, and the amount of credit allowed shall be established by a contract, approved by the city council prior to issuance of any permit for development.

C.    No fee established by this chapter shall be required for development which generates an amount of traffic which is equal to or less than the traffic generated by a previously approved project on the same parcel, if the prior or the present property owner constructed the off site improvements or paid fees required by this chapter for that prior development.

D.    If a development will result in an increase in the amount of traffic generated by a specific parcel, the developer shall be entitled to credit for the amount of fees paid and/or traffic improvements constructed in accordance with this chapter for the prior use.

E.    Preexisting "trip credits" shall be issued by the city engineer at the time that qualifying streets are accepted for maintenance by the city council. At that time, property owners shall submit claims for such credit to the city engineer, together with supporting evidence of actual construction costs. Said credits shall be in the form of certified warrants prepared by the city engineer and authorized by resolution of the city council. They shall be calculated on the basis of actual construction costs divided by the fee per trip in effect at the time of application for an occupancy permit. Warrants of credit shall be used as credit against traffic fees due and payable. No credit will be given for buildings which were not in use (occupied) before the effective date hereof, or which have been vacant more than six (6) months. Credit will be given for prior use if occupied within six (6) months of the effective date hereof.

F.    In each case, the city council shall determine the amount of credit, the value of right of way, or the estimated cost of construction. If the developer disagrees with staff valuation of right of way, or the estimated cost of construction, the developer may submit for city council consideration an independent appraisal of the property, or an independent estimate of the cost of construction prepared by qualified professionals in appraising or engineering. The determination of the city council as to all such matters shall be final and binding upon all persons concerned.

G.    Traffic impact fees identified in this policy are payable in addition to any improvements which the developer must construct or dedications of right of way required in order to resolve problems directly related to the development.

H.    The property owner may request, for city council consideration, a contract of deferred payment for fees exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). Such alternate means of financing traffic impact fees shall be established by contract between the property owner and the city, approved by the city council and in effect prior to issuance of any permit for development.

Adequate fire protection facilities must be available to the Greenfield Fire Protection District to serve new development within the City and District.

B.    Development within the City and District requires the construction or expansion of fire protection facilities and the acquisition of equipment by the Greenfield Fire Protection District.

C.    Adequate funds for expansion or construction of fire facilities and the purchase of equipment by the Greenfield Fire Protection District are not available to the District.

D.    The above conditions place the residents of the City, and the residents of future development projects within the Greenfield Fire Protection District within a condition perilous to their health and safety.

E.    The impacts of development within the City on the existing fire protection facilities and equipment of the Greenfield Fire Protection District cannot be alleviated without City involvement.

F.    The General Plan policies of the City commit the City to aid in the construction of fire suppression facilities.

G.    For the above reasons, new methods of financing fire protection facilities and equipment necessitated by development are needed in the City. (Ord. 387 §1, 1994).

19.20.040 Definitions.

The replacement dwelling shall not exceed the original dwelling by more than ten percent (10%) in size.

B.    The Greenfield Fire Protection District may waive a portion or all of any fee established pursuant to this Chapter if the District finds, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the new development will not significantly add to the need for additional fire protection facilities. (Ord. 387 §1, 1994).

19.20.070 Need for fees and their use.
A.    If the Greenfield Fire Protection District requests an increased mitigation fee in the City, it shall establish that there is a need in the District for fire capital facilities based on new development within the City, as to which the new development has not contributed its fair share. Furthermore, said facilities must have been called for in, or are consistent with, the District’s capital facilities and equipment plan. The need shall be established by a study.

A.    A study and analysis has been prepared by the Greenfield Fire Protection District as a fire capital facilities mitigation analysis.

B.    The City Council shall hold a public hearing to consider the Greenfield Fire Protection District’s fire capital facilities mitigation analysis. After receiving and considering the fire capital facilities mitigation analysis of the Greenfield Fire Protection District, and other testimony, if any, the City may approve the study and find that the new development in the City will generate additional fire service need and will contribute to the degradation of fire services within the City. The Greenfield Fire Protection District shall present to the City facts and evidence which establish a reasonable relationship between the need for the described public facilities and the impact of new development, and that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development for which the fee is charged.

C.    The City Council shall adopt a resolution making the following findings:

1.    The Greenfield Fire Protection District does not have existing adequate fire protection facilities and equipment which could be used to provide an appropriate level of service to new development within the City’s boundaries, as documented in a capital facilities and equipment plan of the Greenfield Fire Protection District.

2.    The Greenfield fire protection district does not have sufficient funds available to construct additional facilities from fund balances, capital facility funds, property tax sources, or any other appropriate sources.

3.    The lack of fire protection facilities and equipment to serve new development within the city would create a situation perilous to the public health and safety of the city and its residents.

4.    Other development fees charged by the city and/or the Greenfield fire protection district do not include a payment toward the cost of the capital facility and equipment expansion necessary as the result of new construction in the city, as a component of the fee, and therefore the fire mitigation fee is necessary within the city. (Ord. 387 §1, 1994)

19.20.090 Fees To Be Fixed By Resolution--Indexing:
The fire mitigation fee to be imposed on new development under the provisions of this chapter shall be fixed and determined by resolution of the city council. The fee levels established shall be adjusted annually in accordance with the most current "Engineering News Record" construction cost index. Annual changes shall be effective on July 1 of each year. (Ord. 466 §2, 2007: Ord. 387 §1, 1994)

19.20.100 Fee Pavrnent:
A.    Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the applicant for such building permit shall pay to the city the fees prescribed by the city’s resolution.

B.    The amount of such fees shall be determined by the fee resolution in effect on the date the applicant applies for, and pays fees for, an unexpired plan check.

C.    In the event that subsequent development occurs with respect to property for which fees have been paid, additional fees shall be required only for additional square footage of development which was not included in computing a prior fee. (Ord. 387 §1, 1994)

19.20.110 Use Of Fees:
All fees collected pursuant to this chapter and transferred to the Greenfield fire protection district shall be used by the Greenfield fire protection district for the purpose of providing for capital facilities and equipment necessary to provide service to new development in the Greenfield fire protection district. (Ord. 387 §1, 1994)

19.20.120 District Reporting Requirements:
A.    The Greenfield fire protection district shall be required to place all funds received under this program, and all interest subsequently accrued by the Greenfield fire protection district on these funds, in a separate budget accounting category to be known as the "Greenfield fire protection district".

B.    The Greenfield fire protection district shall be required to expend funds from the city mitigation fee budget category only for the purpose of providing capital facilities and equipment in the Greenfield fire protection district.

C.    The city and the Greenfield fire protection district shall maintain adequate accounting records.

D.    The Greenfield fire protection district shall submit a report no later than October 31 of each year to the director. Said report shall include the balance in the account at the end of the previous fiscal year, the fee revenue received, the amount and type of expenditures made, and the ending balance in the fund. The report shall specify how funds have been spent or committed in the Greenfield fire protection district’s budget. In addition, the report shall specify the actions the district plans to take to alleviate the facility and equipment needs caused by new development in the city in a capital facilities mitigation analysis. The Greenfield fire protection district shall make available upon request by the city council a copy of its annual audit report.

E.    The Greenfield city council shall make its records available to the public on request at all reasonable times.

F.    The Greenfield fire protection district shall make findings with respect to any portion of the fee remaining unexpended or uncommitted in its account for five (5) or more years after deposit of the fee to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged. The Greenfield fire protection district shall refund to the then current record owner or owners of the development project or projects on a prorated basis the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be demonstrated. Fees expended by the Greenfield fire protection district in good faith in accordance with the capital facilities plan are nonrefundable if the project does not proceed to completion. However, if the project later proceeds, the fee paid shall apply pro rata to the new development. (Ord. 466 §3, 2007: Ord. 387 §1, 1994)

19.50.010 Findings.
A.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that future development within the city of Greenfield to the year 2030 will result in degradation of traffic levels of service on the regional transportation system of streets, arterials, and highways.

B.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system as new development is approved will increase congestion on the regional system, as documented in the Regional Development Impact Fee--Nexus Study Update (the study) approved by the board of the transportation agency of Monterey County (TAMC) on January 16, 2008. TAMC commissioned the study which looks at, among other matters, future development and the planned future road improvements needed to serve the new development.

C.    The city council of the city of Greenfield also finds and declares that the fair-share traffic impact fee to be levied upon new development pursuant to this chapter provides a mechanism to fund new developments’ share of regional transportation system improvements that are needed to mitigate congestion and related adverse impacts caused by the new development.

D.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that exactions from new development are necessary to provide a portion of the funding for the construction of the regional transportation improvements needed to accommodate traffic that will be generated by new development of land within the county.

E.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that the study has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the regional transportation system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing the unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development.

F.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the regional development impact fee to pay for the construction of the regional transportation improvement projects and the type of development for which the regional development impact fee is charged in that all new development in the county, both residential and nonresidential, will generate or contribute to the need for the regional transportation improvement projects in different degrees as further described in the study.

G.    The city council of the city of Greenfield finds that the cost estimates set forth in the TAMC 2007 Regional Development Impact Nexus Fee Study Update are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the transportation improvement projects, and the regional development impact fees expected to be generated by future development will not exceed the projected costs of constructing the transportation improvement projects.

H.    The city council of the city of Greenfield also finds that the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall only be used to finance the regional transportation improvement projects. The county adopts this chapter with the expectation that a required minimum number of TAMC member governing bodies will also adopt the RDIF on a uniform basis and that the county and these other TAMC members will use the fees collected in a coordinated manner to provide for financing and construction of the regional transportation improvement projects.

I.    The city council of the city of Greenfield has reviewed and considered the certified environmental impact report for the 2005 Monterey Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan and Addendum thereto prepared by TAMC, the lead agency for the regional transportation impact fee for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq.).

J.    The city council of the city of Greenfield has authorized the execution and delivery of a joint powers agreement (JPA), attached to the ordinance codifed in this chapter, establishing a regional development impact fee agency (RDIF agency) to coordinate the activities of the parties to the JPA in connection with the collection, transmittal and expenditure of regional development impact fees (as defined herein). (Ord. 485 §1(part), 2008).

19.50.020 Terms and definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

A.    "Applicant" means the person or entity applying for a tract map, parcel map, tentative subdivision map, conditional use permit, land use permit, building permit or other land use entitlement for a new development project and their successors and assigns.

B.    "RDIF agency" refers to the Monterey County regional development impact fee joint powers agency.

C.    "Regional development impact fee," or "the fee," or "RDIF" refers to the fees approved by the governing boards of the county and other TAMC members on new development within their respective jurisdictions and transmitted to the RDIF agency as provided in the JPA. The project list for the regional development impact fee is in Exhibit B of the JPA attached to the ordinance codifed in this chapter.

D.    "Regional transportation improvement projects," or "projects" refers to those public improvements required to mitigate the regional impacts of new development on the roads, highways and arterials within the county as specified in section 19.50.070. (Ord. 485 §1(part), 2008).

19.50.030 Establishment of a regional development impact fee.
A.    The regional development impact fee is hereby established in the amounts specified in a resolution to be adopted by the board of supervisors for the purpose of paying for regional transportation improvement projects identified in Exhibit B of the JPA needed to meet increased demand created by traffic resulting from new development. The revenues raised from the impact fee shall be remitted to the RDIF agency to be held, maintained, used and accounted for as required in Government Code section 66006 of the Mitigation Fee Act in a coordinated fashion, as provided in the JPA.

B.    The regional development impact fee shall be automatically adjusted as of July 1st of each year following the first year after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The adjustment shall be calculated by TAMC as administrator of the RDIF agency, based on the increase or decrease in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the period ending December 31st of the preceding calendar year.

C.    In addition to the automatic adjustment set forth above, TAMC may recommend to the county and other TAMC members that the regional development impact fee be increased to reflect revisions to the project list in the Monterey County regional transportation plan, program revenue, increases in land values over the inflationary increase, or other factors.

D.    Except as provided in Government Code sections 65961, 66474.2 and 66498.1 or as otherwise provided by state or federal law or the exemptions set forth in section 19.50.040, no tract map, parcel map, tentative subdivision map, conditional use permit, land use permit, building permit or other land use entitlement for a new development project shall be approved or issued unless payment of the fee is a condition of approval for any such entitlement. Prior to issuance of a building permit or at such other time as required by law, the county shall require the applicant to pay the fee.

E.    Impact fees shall be imposed and collected by the county and, along with any interest earned on the fees while in the possession of the county, shall be transmitted by the county to the RDIF agency on the first day of each month for all fees collected during the prior month. The fees shall be placed by the RDIF agency in the regional transportation impact fee trust fund. All interest or other earnings of the fund shall be credited to the fund. (Ord. 485 §1(part), 2008).

19.50.040 Exemptions.
In addition to any exemptions from the levy of development impact fees provided by law, including, as applicable, the levy of development impact fees which are the subject of a vested subdivision map, the following development projects are exempt from payment of the fee required by this chapter:

A.    Credit or Reimbursement for Regional Transportation Impact Projects Funded by the RDIF: An applicant may be eligible for a credit to be applied against payment of the regional transportation impact fee if the applicant dedicates right-of-way for and/or constructs all or a part of one of the transportation improvement projects that is, at the time the applicant enters into an agreement with the county for construction of such project, included in the strategic expenditure plan of the projects to be funded.

An applicant may be eligible for a reimbursement if the cost of constructing such a transportation improvement project, or a part of such project, exceeds the amount of the regional transportation impact fee to be paid by the applicant. The amount of reimbursement shall equal the difference between the cost of constructing all or a part of the regional transportation improvement project and the regional development impact fee for the development project.

Reimbursement shall be from regional development impact fee revenues only, and the right to reimbursement shall be terminated ten (10) years from the date the applicant entered into the agreement for construction of the project.

The amount of credit, or the credit and reimbursement together, shall be in an amount equal to the cost of the regional transportation improvement project or portion thereof, as calculated by the RDIF agency. The credit, or the credit and reimbursement together, shall be calculated at the time the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of the regional transportation improvement project. The credit shall be granted at the same time. Once calculated, the amount of reimbursement shall not increase for inflation nor shall it accrue interest.

B.    Reimbursement for Projects Not Funded for Construction at the Time of Project Construction: If an applicant constructs all or a part of a transportation improvement project that is not, at the time the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of such project, included in the strategic expenditure plan as a project to be funded, the developer may be eligible for reimbursement from the RDIF; provided, that the strategic expenditure plan is subsequently revised to include the improvement as a project to be funded.

In such event, the amount of reimbursement shall be calculated by the county public works director and approved by the RDIF agency for development located in unincorporated Monterey County and shall be equal to the cost of the project or portion thereof, as set forth in the strategic expenditure plan. The amount of the reimbursement shall be calculated when the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of the transportation improvement project. Once calculated, the amount of reimbursement shall not increase for inflation nor shall it accrue interest. Reimbursement shall be from regional development impact fee revenues only, and the right to reimbursement shall be terminated ten (10) years from the date the developer entered into the agreement for construction of the project. (Ord. 485 §1(part), 2008).

19.50.060 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the portions of this chapter not held to be unconstitutional or invalid.

20.10.010 Density Bonus Request And Review:
For subdivision projects, the density bonus shall be requested and reviewed as part of the tentative map project application. For nonsubdivision projects, the density bonus shall be requested and reviewed through a conditional use permit application. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).

20.10.020 Required Application Materials:
In addition to the materials normally required for a tentative map or conditional use permit application, the applications shall clearly identify the restricted units and shall contain information sufficient to demonstrate that the project is a qualifying project. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).

20.10.030 Supplemental Application Materials:
The Planning Director shall prepare and maintain a list of supplemental application materials for density bonus requests under this Title which materials shall be submitted together with and as part of the project application. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).

At a minimum, the application shall include an itemized accounting of projected costs and revenues of the development, both with and without the incentives. Project revenues shall include monies from the sale or rental of all units, including the bonus units. Project costs shall not include the "lost opportunity" cost of the restricted units, i.e., the amount that would have been generated had the restricted units been rented or sold at market rate. Project costs may include items that are required solely as a result of the inclusion of the bonus units and would not have been required without such units. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).

20.10.060 Project Analysis:
The Planning Director may direct, at the applicant’s expense, that an independent analysis be conducted of the project’s costs, revenues, and property value in order to determine the necessity for any requested density bonus and/or incentive. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).

20.10.070 City Decision:
The City may accept, modify or recommend different incentives than those requested so long as the recommended incentive has the effect of reducing development standards or requirements or reduces or avoids costs to the developer. The City may disapprove the requested incentives subject to the findings set forth in Chapter 20.08.020 of this Title. (Ord. 398 §1, 1997).
