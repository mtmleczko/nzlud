PREFACE 
    The Greenwich Municipal Code replaces the Compilation of Special Acts and Ordinances of the Town of Greenwich published January 1, 1950. It is divided into two component parts. The first part, consisting of Articles 1 through 17 with Appendix, constitutes the Charter of the Town of Greenwich. The second part consists of all of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature which have been enacted by the Town. Both parts speak as of October 31, 1975, except as otherwise indicated below the Chapter or Article caption. 
    The Articles and Sections contained in this Code were classified according to subject matter, obsolete and repealed provisions and certain invalid provisions were deleted, amendments were added and the remainder edited. As such, the Law Department is of the opinion that once having been duly approved by the appropriate legislative bodies of the Town (as it has been - see attachments to this preface), this Code, as it may from time to time be amended, will constitute an official codification and will be entitled to authoritative reliance. 
    To facilitate usage, the Code Chapters are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered consecutively by Arabic numerals. Each Chapter is preceded by a Chapter Table of Contents which designates the materials included within the Chapter. The general Index, which appears at the end of the Code, will serve as an accurate aid in locating specific provisions within the Code. References to the Charter may be easily identified as they contain only one number. 
    Each Section number of the Ordinances consists of two component parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the Chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the Section within the Chapter. Accordingly Section 10-12 indicates the tenth Chapter and the twelfth Section within that Chapter. In addition, a uniform system of designating sub-classifications of Sections has been utilized throughout. Where appropriate, the Chapters have been subdivided into Articles. Divisions and Sections. Catchlines precede each of the various Code subdivisions. These catchlines indicate in capsule form the contents of each subdivision. 
    The legislative history appearing at the end of each Section in the Code will enable the user to readily ascertain the original Special Acts. Home Rule Action and Ordinances from which the new Section has been derived. References to "Ords. & Reg." are to Chapters and Sections of the 1950 Compilation, which will ordinarily provide further source material. 
    New material may be inserted in the Ordinances without disturbing the existing numbering scheme by using a decimal system of numbering. For instance, if three new Sections logically should be placed between Section 10-12 and 10-13, such new Sections could be designated Sections 10-12.1, 10-12.2 and 10-12.3 respectively. New Chapters may be included by the addition of a capital letter after the Chapter number. If the new Chapter is to be included between Chapter 18 and Chapter 19, it would be designated Chapter 18A. 
    By using the decimal system, new Articles and Divisions also may be inserted in the Ordinances between existing Articles and Divisions. If logic requires, new Articles and Divisions may be inserted at the end of the appropriate Chapter or Article, with the next successive number being assigned to the Article or Division. 
    The loose-leaf binder housing the Code facilitates the addition or removal of future legislation and should serve as a convenient device for keeping the Code current. 
    Footnotes are contained throughout the Code in an effort to correlate related Code provisions, relevant Connecticut Statutes and reported Court decisions. 
    This Code was prepared by the National Institute of Municipal Officers. The Law Department of the Town of Greenwich expresses its appreciation to the officials and employees of the Town for their cooperation during the preparation of this Code. Special acknowledgment is made of the impetus given this project by former Town Attorney Joseph A. Izzillo.

(b)  If a member terminates his service after completion of the number of years of creditable service required to be vested in the attached schedule applicable to the member at time of termination he may elect to continue as a member of the System and receive a deferred vested service retirement allowance following completion of the minimum requirements for service retirement as in effect at the time his service is terminated in accordance with Sections 179(c) and 182.

Such percentage of compensation shall be computed on the basis of membership service and actuarial assumptions of future service adopted by the Board and the rate of benefit contained in the attached schedules pertinent to such members. Such percentage of compensation shall be computed to remain constant. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary the percentage may be fixed in the attached schedules pertinent to the members. The Town shall withhold or otherwise credit such percentage of the earnable compensation due on each pay day to members of the Retirement System so determined. The various amounts so withheld or credited shall be transferred immediately thereafter to the Retirement System and credited to the accounts of the respective members, and the amounts shall be paid into and become a part of the Annuity Savings Fund.

(c)  The deductions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member will be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions provided for herein and shall receipt for his full salary or compensation, and the payment of his full salary or compensation less the deductions provided for hereunder shall be considered a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits provided under the Retirement System. 
(d)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (g), in addition to the contributions deducted from compensation as hereinbefore provided, subject to the approval of the Retirement Board, any member may redeposit in the Annuity Savings Fund by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount equal to the total amount which he previously withdrew therefrom, as provided in this Article, or any part thereof, or any member may deposit therein by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount computed to be sufficient to purchase an additional annuity which, together with his prospective retirement allowance, will provide for him a total retirement allowance not to exceed one-half (1/2) of his salary upon completion of the minimum requirements for service retirement. Such additional amounts so deposited shall be treated as a part of his accumulated deductions, except in the event of his retirement when they shall be treated as excess contributions returnable to the member in cash or to provide an excess annuity of equivalent actuarial value. 
(e)  The accumulated deductions of a member withdrawn by him or paid to his designated beneficiary or legal representatives in event of his death, shall be paid from the Annuity Savings Fund. 
(f)  Upon the retirement of a member his accumulated deductions shall be transferred from the Annuity Savings Fund to the Accumulation Fund. 
(g)  (1)  Prior to January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any member classified as a general employee may, at any time after an agreement extending coverage under the Social Security Act with respect to his service as a member has been entered into as provided in Section 218 of such Act, elect to reduce his contributions by the amount of his tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act as from time to time in effect by filing written notice of such election with the Retirement Board at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such reduction is to become effective. In addition, any member may elect, within thirty (30) days after such agreement extending coverage under the Social Security Act becomes effective, to have withdrawn from his account in the Annuity Savings Fund an amount sufficient to pay his tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act from January 1, 1955, or his date of membership, if later, to the date the agreement becomes effective. In the event a member does not make such election, he may alternatively elect to make payment of such retroactive tax in a lump sum. If neither election is made, as a condition of continued employment, deductions equivalent to such retroactive tax shall be made from the compensation of such member in six (6) equal monthly installments beginning thirty (30) days after the effective date of the agreement. 
(2)  Effective January 1, 2002, the following rules shall apply with respect to the ability of a general employee member to reduce the amount of his contributions under Subsection (g)(1) above unless the contribution is made mandatory by the provisions of the attached schedule pertinent to the employee. 
A.  New Hires. Any person who becomes a general employee on or after January 1, 2002 must make his election to reduce contributions pursuant to (g)(1) above within thirty (30) days of his date of hire. If an election is not received by the Town during this period of time, the employee will be required to make such contributions throughout the period(s) of his creditable service. 
B.  Current employees. Any general employee who is a member as of January 1, 2002, may make a one-time election to either reduce contributions pursuant to (g)(1) above or to revoke a prior election to reduce contributions. A notice of election rights shall be provided to such employees as soon as practicable thereafter, and such election must be received by the Town by an announced due date (which shall be no later than the 60th day after such notice has been provided.) If an election is not received by the Town by such due date, his existing treatment shall remain in effect throughout the remaining period(s) of his creditable service. 
(h)  Effective January 1, 2002, a member who elected to reduce his contributions during the member's period of creditable service pursuant to Subsection (g) above may elect, at the time of retirement, to make a one-time make-up contribution. Such make-up contribution shall be funded a by a direct transfer of an eligible rollover distribution from the Savings Plan for Employees of the Town of Greenwich into the annuity savings fund of the Retirement System in an amount not in excess of the amount computed to be sufficient, when added to the member's actual accumulated deductions, if any, to equal the maximum amount of accumulated deductions that would exist if mandatory contributions had been made during his entire period of creditable service. Such make-up contributions shall be treated as accumulated deductions in the annuity Savings Fund, and shall immediately be transferred to the accumulation fund pursuant to Section 204(f). 
(i)  The Town shall pick up the employee contributions required of members. For non-collectively bargained members, the pick up will be effective for all compensation earned after December 31, 1991. For collectively bargained members, the pick up will be effective as directed in the applicable collective bargaining unit agreement. The contributions so picked-up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions picked-up pursuant to this provision shall be treated for all other purposes, in the same manner and to the same extent, as employee contributions made prior to the effective date of this paragraph. 
(j)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Retirement System to the contrary, effective January 1, 1995, certain members identified by the Town in the attached schedules pertinent to such members shall not have a percentage of earnable compensation deducted from each payment of his prospective compensation as set forth in Subsection (a) above. 
(S.A. 408 § 16, 1945; as amended and approved BET 6/17/1974, 11/19/2001, 12/19/2011.) 
Sec. 205. - Accumulation Fund; Operational Procedure. 
(a)  The Accumulation Fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves and payments contributed by the Town for the payment of all pensions and other benefits payable from contributions by the Town, and from which shall be paid all annuities, pensions and benefits in lieu thereof. Should a beneficiary be restored to membership, his annuity reserve shall be transferred from the Accumulation Fund to the Annuity Savings Fund, and credited to his individual account therein. 
(b)  There shall be paid by the Town annually into the Accumulation Fund on account of each member, a certain percentage of the earnable compensation of such member, to be known as the "normal contribution rate" of the Town for membership service, and an additional percentage of his earnable compensation to be known as the "accrued liability contribution rate" of the Town for prior service. 
(c)  Computation of normal contribution of the Town for membership service. During the period over which the accrued liability contribution is payable, on the basis of interest and of such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the Retirement Board, the actuary engaged by the Board to make each valuation required by this Article, immediately after making such valuation, shall determine the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of each member, which if contributed on the basis of compensation of each member throughout his entire period of active service would be sufficient to provide for the payment of any pension payable on his account. The rate percent so determined shall be known as the "normal contribution" rate. Until the accrued liability has been liquidated the normal percentage contribution rate of the Town for membership service shall be determined as described above. After the accrued liability has been liquidated, the normal contribution rate of the Town shall be determined by actuarial calculation as the rate percent of the earnable compensation of all members, which is required as a contribution by the Town in order to provide the part of the cost of all benefits for which the Town is responsible. It shall be determined by actuarial means of the following: At the time of each annual actuarial valuation the actuary shall first compute the present value of the prospective benefits payable from the Accumulation Fund to active members and beneficiaries on the valuation date. He shall then deduct therefrom the assets to the credit of the Accumulation Fund on the valuation date. The remainder represents the present value of future contributions on account of employees who are then members or beneficiaries, to be contributed by the Town in the future in order to keep the Fund in balance. The actuary shall then determine what percentage of the future earnable compensation of all members, if contributed by the Town, will be sufficient to produce such contributions required of the Town. 
(d)  Computation of accrued liability contribution of the Town. Immediately succeeding the valuation as of December 31, 1962, the actuary engaged by the Retirement Board shall compute the rate percent of the total annual earnable compensation of all members based on the Board's funding policy and using an expected payment period of not more than 30 years. The rate percent so determined shall be known as the "accrued liability contribution" rate of the Town. 
(e)  Contributions by the Town after the valuation as of December 31, 1962. The total amount payable in each year by the Town to the Accumulation Fund shall not be less than the amount obtained by applying the sum of the rates percent known as the normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution rate to the total compensation earnable by all members during the preceding year, provided that the aggregate payment by the Town shall be sufficient, when combined with the amount in the Accumulation Fund, to provide the annuities, pensions and other benefits payable from the Fund during the year then current. 
(f)  Discontinuance of accrued liability contributions by the Town. The accrued liability contribution shall be discontinued as soon as the accumulated reserves in the Accumulation Fund shall equal the then present value, as actuarially computed and approved by the Retirement Board, of the total liability of the fund less the then present value, computed on the basis of the normal contribution rate of the Town for future service then in force, of the prospective normal contributions to be received on account of persons who are at that time members. 
(g)  Accounting procedure. All interests and dividends earned on the funds of the Retirement System shall be credited to the Accumulation Fund. Annually the Retirement Board shall transfer, from the Accumulation Fund to the Annuity Savings Fund an amount sufficient to allow interest on the balances of the members' accounts. 
(h)  All annuities, pensions, and benefits in lieu thereof shall be paid from the Accumulation Fund. 
(S.A. 408 § 16, 1945, as amended and approved BET 12/19/2011.) 
Sec. 206. - Expense Fund. 
    The Expense Fund shall be the fund to which shall be credited all money appropriated by the Town to pay the administration expenses of the Retirement System, and from which shall be paid all the expenses necessary in connection with the administration and operation of the System except that such expenses may be paid or deducted wholly or partially from investment earnings or the corpus of the Accumulation Fund when and to the extent authorized by the Board of Estimate and Taxation upon the recommendation of the Retirement Board.

With respect to administration expenses, the Retirement Board shall specify which expenses, if any, it recommends be paid from appropriations to be credited to the Expense Fund and which expenses, if any, it recommends be paid from investment earnings or from the corpus of the Accumulation Fund. The items of appropriation, if any, providing such amount for the System, shall be included in the appropriations submitted to the Representative Town Meeting, and appropriations to the Systems of such amounts shall be made.

All investments of the funds of the Retirement System shall be made with the care of a prudent investor in accordance with, and subject to, the limitations of the General Statutes relating to the investment of trust funds held by trustees. The Retirement Board or the corporation trustee, as the case may be, may invest funds of the Retirement System in any securities, or other property, which they may select to an amount not exceeding seventy-five percent (75%) of the total funds of the Retirement system. The remainder of said funds shall be invested exclusively in cash and diversified fixed income securities and such securities shall not include any equity, real estate, tangible, commodity or private equity investment. 
(b)  The Treasurer of the Town shall be custodian of the several Funds. The books and accounts of the Retirement System shall be kept by the Comptroller and audited by the Town auditors. All payments from the Funds shall be made by checks issued by the Comptroller and signed by the Treasurer upon vouchers signed by two (2) persons designated by the Retirement Board. A duly attested copy of a resolution of the Retirement Board designating such persons and bearing upon its face specimen signatures of such persons shall be filed with the Comptroller and Treasurer as their authority for making payments upon such vouchers. No voucher shall be drawn unless it shall have been previously authorized by resolution of the Retirement Board. 
(c)  The funds of the Retirement System deposited in any one (1) bank or trust company shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the paid-up capital and surplus of such bank or trust company.

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, if the Retirement Board shall be of the opinion that any benefit prescribed in this Article can be provided with equal security to the members, through the purchase thereof from any insurance company or companies approved by the Board of Estimate and Taxation, the Retirement Board, with the approval of the Board of Estimate and Taxation and of the Representative Town Meeting, is authorized to provide for the payment of such benefits through the purchase thereof from such company or companies and to make payment therefor from the funds which would be available for the provision of such benefits directly under this Article. 
(S.A. 408 § 17, 1945, as amended and approved BET 1/19/1982, 11/17/1986, 9/24/2013; RTM 1/27/2014; RTM 9/15/2014.)

If any change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving from the Retirement System more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the Retirement Board may correct such error, and as far as practicable, adjust the payments in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(S.A. 408 § 19, 1945.)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a widow in receipt of a pension or other benefit provided wholly or partly at the expense of the Town on account of her deceased husband's participation in any other pension or benefit system may be or become an employee of the Town in a position covered by this Retirement System and participate as a member herein on account of service rendered to the Town by her in such position.

In the event of the termination of the System for any cause, each member and beneficiary shall be entitled to the reserve held on his account as the result of all previous contributions made by him and by the Town. In such event the reserves to which members become entitled upon such termination shall be payable in cash or in the form of immediate or deferred annuities, as the Retirement Board, in its discretion, shall determine. In such event, further if the reserve held on account of any beneficiary is inadequate to continue his full retirement allowance, he shall nevertheless be entitled to have his retirement allowance continued in full, and the additional amounts required to pay such allowance in full shall be paid by the Town.

In determining such apportionment the Condemnation Commission, among other factors, may consider whether such benefits are direct or remote, the present and prospective use of the land and the improvements thereon, the increase in the value of the property benefited by such construction, the frontage, size and shape of such property, the valuation of the land in the last-completed grand list of the Town, and the valuation of any buildings or improvements on such land as set forth in the list, and the amount of sewer assessments previously levied on such lot or parcel reduced by the proportionate amount of reasonable depreciation of the improvement for which said sewer assessments were levied. 
(b)  The Condemnation Commission shall file in the office of the Town Clerk a map showing the separately owned lots or parcels of land specially benefited, and designating by numbers the several lots or parcels of land thus benefited. The Commission shall also file in the office of the Town Clerk its proposed apportionment and assessment of benefits which shall describe by reference to the map or otherwise each lot or parcel of land specially benefited, designate the owner thereof and the benefit to be apportioned thereto. The Town Clerk shall receive the map for filing even though the same may not comply with the requirements of the General Statutes for such filing.

Sec. 258. - Assessment of benefits. 
    The Condemnation Commission shall assess against each lot or parcel of land within an area of benefit the amount of the benefits apportioned to each such lot or parcel. Such assessments shall be set forth in an assessment list which shall be known as the "Sewer Assessment List" for such sewer or sewerage system which shall describe by reference to the map or otherwise each lot or parcel of land specially benefited, the owner thereof and the benefits apportioned and assessed thereto. The Commission shall file said list in the office of the Town Clerk, and within ten (10) days after such filing, shall give notice of such assessment, and the amount thereof, by mailing a notice thereof to each owner, addressed to him at his last-known post office address, and by publishing a notice of such filing in a newspaper having circulation in the Town.

Such appeal shall not be valid unless brought within thirty (30) days after the filing of the assessment of damages or benefits as provided in this Article. The appeal shall be taken by a notice stating the grounds thereof served on the Town in the manner provided by law for service of process in civil actions. 
(b)  The Court may hear such appeal and approve or disapprove such assessments. If the assessments are disapproved the Court may increase or decrease such assessment or may appoint three (3) disinterested persons to appraise the damages or benefits to such property and make a report of their doings to the Court. The damages or benefits determined in such report may be confirmed by the Court or may be increased or decreased by the Court. 
(c)  Such appeal, during the pendency thereof, shall stay further proceedings for the collection of the particular assessment upon which the appeal is predicated, but shall not stay any other proceedings in relation to such project. All appeals with respect to the assessment of damages or benefits may be consolidated and costs taxed in the discretion of the Court.

Such rate of interest, and the number of installments, which shall not exceed twenty (20), shall be determined by the Board of Estimate and Taxation. Overdue assessments and installments thereof shall bear the same rate of interest as overdue Town taxes. The entire unpaid balance of any assessment may be paid at any time with the accrued interest to the date of payment. If two (2) successive annual installments are in default, the entire balance, at the option of the Board of Estimate and Taxation, shall forthwith become due and payable with interest.

On or before January 31 preceding the due date of each annual tax, the Assessor shall present to the Board of Estimate and Taxation a statement showing the total assessed valuation upon the grand list last completed of the real estate including land and buildings within the sewer district. The Board, by the affirmative vote of seven (7) of its members, shall on or before May 25 determine the tax rate which shall be laid thereon to pay for the portion of the cost of such project to be recovered in the following year, together with interest accruing during the year on the unpaid balance of indebtedness incurred to pay such part of the cost of such project as is to be recovered by taxation of properties within the Sewer District, and levy taxes at a uniform rate upon such properties. 
(c)  The chairman and clerk of the Board shall forthwith file a certificate of the laying and levying of such taxes in the office of the Town Clerk. Such taxes shall become due in two (2) equal installments with the Town taxes, shall bear the same rate of interest as unpaid town taxes, and shall be a lien upon such properties, including any buildings and improvements thereon, from the date of the last-completed grand list, provided that no lien shall continue to exist for more than one (1) year from the date that the tax becomes due and payable unless continued in the manner provided by law for the continuance of real property tax liens. Such lien shall take precedence over all other liens and encumbrances excepting existing taxes or assessments.

Sec. 269a. - Connections. 
(a)  Definitions: As used in this section the following terms have the following meanings: 
    " Planned Sewered Area " - Those areas of the Town which were designed to be included within the capacity of the sewer plant, which areas include areas already sewered, areas which may require sewering and areas for which growth is planned, which growth may require sewering, all as shown on that certain map known as the 1989 Sewer Boundary Map dated November 1, 1989; Revision 3, November 20, 1990 on file in the office of the Commissioner. 
    " Non-Sewered Area " - Those areas of the Town planned not to be included within the present capacity of the sewer plant as presently designed, in which areas, because of larger lot zones and/or soil types, it is planned that sewerage disposal will be on site and not a burden on the sewer plant or the waters of Long Island Sound, all as shown on said aforesaid map. 
(b)  Purpose. This section recognizes that the preservation of the waters of Long Island Sound are paramount to the best interests of the people of the Town and State and that the directing of unplanned for sewerage to the sewer plant and thus ultimately into the Sound is not the solution under present technology, the capacity of sewer plants being limited and planned capacity should be protected to avoid any possible present or future threat to the quality of the waters of the Sound, and that planned on-site disposal in the Non-Sewered Area best serves these interests. 
(c)  Connections - findings: In the event that any owner of land shall desire to in any way connect into any sewer or sewerage system in the Planned Sewered Area, such owner may petition the Commissioner for a connection permit. The Commissioner shall have the authority to allow such land owner to connect with such sewer. In accordance with the purpose set forth in this subsection, the Commissioner shall establish guidelines for sewer connections, which guidelines shall be submitted to the Board of Selectmen for review prior to adoption by the Commissioner. 
(d)  If the property to be served by the connection lies within the unplanned for Non-Sewered Area, in which connections are disfavored as not being in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare, then the Commissioner shall have authority to allow such land owner to connect with such sewer only if the Commissioner can make an affirmative finding in writing as to each of the following factors: 
1.  That the zoning enforcement officer has determined that all existing and planned structures on the property to be serviced through the connection are in conformity with the zoning regulations. 
2.  That the Director of Health has determined that on-site sewerage disposal cannot be provided. 
3.  That permitting the connection would not contravene any law, rule, regulation, condition or policy of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection or of any agreement between the Town and said Department, particularly concerning any new construction in whole or part, upon a floodplain, flood hazard area, wetland area, beach, dune or other environmentally sensitive area. 
4.  That the present, future or cumulative effect of the connection will not adversely affect the sewer plant's planned capacity for future growth or shorten its useful life. 
5.  That the present, future or cumulative effect of the connection will not expose the sewer plant to overload or adversely threaten the quality of the waters of the Sound. 
6.  That the Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee has determined affirmatively in writing that the present, future or cumulative effect of permitting the connection will not adversely affect the Town Plan of Conservation and Development or other Town planning or development plans. 
7.  That permitting the connection will not adversely affect the sewerage system, the Town's efforts to decrease infiltration and inflow or burden maintenance. 
(RTM, 6/10/1991; RTM, 10/28/1996.) 
Sec. 270. - Connection to sewer or sewerage systems. 
    The Commissioner shall have power, if in his judgment it will be for the best interests of the Town, to connect any sewer, trunk sewer or sewerage system with any other sewer, trunk sewer or sewerage system whether owned or operated privately or by the Town.

From and after the beginning of the first year of repayment of such cost, such plant connection charge shall be in accordance with the following schedule: 
Plant Connection Charge Per Family Unit or Equivalent Thereof 
Year of Connection 
(Yr. of Repayment) Year of Connection 
(Yr. of Repayment)  1 $ 75 14 $175  2   75 15  175  3   75 16  165  4  100 17  165  5  100 18  165  6  125 19  165  7  140 20  165  8  140 21  150  9  140 22  150 10  140 23  125 11  175 24  125 12  175 25  100 13  175 Thereafter  100  
(b)  If there shall be bonding for further plant and/or trunk sewer work, the schedule of plant connection charges above set forth shall be increased from and after the beginning of the first year of repayment of the cost of such additional bonding by the amount of Ten Dollars ($10) for each One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) of bonds or major part thereof issued, provided, however, that in no event shall the connection charge exceed the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200).

Each portion shall thereafter be subject only to the amount so apportioned against it with interest, if any. 
(S.A. 292, 1949.) 
Sec. 274. - Lien upon land and improvements. 
    A sewer assessment made under the provisions of this Article shall be a lien upon the land and improvements upon which it is made with interest until paid. Such lien shall take effect upon the filing of the assessment list in the office of the Town Clerk and shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances, except existing taxes or assessments. The Town Clerk shall index or cause to be indexed in the general indices of the land records of the Town all assessments appearing on assessment lists, but the failure to index shall not invalidate such liens. Such lien may be enforced in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of liens for Town taxes. 
(S.A. 292, 1949.) 
Sec. 275. - Collection of assessments and taxes. 
    The Town shall have the same authority in the collection of sewer assessments and taxes as it has in the collection of Town taxes, except that any assessment against property in an area of future benefit which neither abuts nor is connected with a sewer at the time of assessment may only be collected when the same becomes due by foreclosure of the lien therefor.

Sec. 6-226. - Application procedure. 
(a)  Submission of application. 
(1)  Any person wishing to carry out a regulated activity or an activity which may involve a regulated activity shall submit an application to the Agency. The application shall be deemed received only at a regular meeting of the Agency. Regular meetings shall be those regularly scheduled meetings which have been noticed annually to the Town Clerk and those special meetings called upon prior notice. 
(2)  No application submitted to the Agency shall be deemed complete unless it shall be in such form and contain such information as the Agency deems necessary for a fair determination of the issues. The Agency shall inform all applicants of any additional information needed by it without delay. The Agency shall inform each applicant, in writing, of the date of the meeting at which his application will be received. 
(3)  The original and six (6) copies of the application shall be submitted to the Agency. 
(4)  All information submitted in the application for review shall be considered factual and binding. A knowing failure of the applicant or any of his, her or its agents to provide correct information or performance exceeding the levels of activity anticipated shall be sufficient grounds for the revocation of any permit under these regulations and/or for penalties to be imposed. Each day of violation or deception shall be considered as a separate offense. 
(b)  All applications shall include the following information in writing on a form provided by the Agency: 
(1)  The applicant's name, home and business addresses and telephone numbers. 
(2)  The owner's name (if the applicant is not the owner of the property), home and business addresses, telephone numbers and written consent to the proposed activity set forth in the application. 
(3)  The applicant's interest in the land. 
(4)  The location of the land upon which the proposed activity is to occur.

(6)  The purpose and description of the proposed activity. 
(7)  The names of adjacent property owners. 
(8)  Required additional information. 
(c)  Declaratory ruling; exemptions. If the Agency finds, on the basis of the evidence before it, that a proposed activity or use does not involve any regulated activity or involves only a permitted use as defined in Section 6-224, a letter of permission to proceed shall be granted forthwith. This permission shall be subject to limitation or revocation if it is later shown that a regulated activity or nonpermitted use is a consequence of that proposed activity. The Agency shall state in writing its reasons for finding that a proposed permitted use or other activity does not involve a regulated activity pursuant to Section 6-225(b) of these regulations. 
(d)  Summary ruling; permits. If the Agency finds that a proposed activity is a regulated activity not involving significant impact or major effect on the inland wetland or watercourse, it may allow the activity with or without conditions after initial review. In order to grant a permit at this stage, the Agency, after full review of the considerations set forth in Section 6-227(a)(4) through (8) and other pertinent factors, shall state upon the record reasons for granting the permit with or without conditions. Such statement may include discussion of the considerations and criteria listed in Section 6-227(a)(4) through (8). 
(e)  Plenary rulings. If the Agency finds that the activity applied for does or may involve a significant or major effect on the inland wetland or watercourse, the Agency shall request information which may include, but is not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Site plan. A map of the proposed use of the applicant's property and any adjacent property which will be affected, drawn by a licensed surveyor, professional engineer or professional architect, who is registered in the State of Connecticut. The map shall be at a scale to be determined by the Agency. Detailed information to be included on this site plan shall be requested by the Agency according to its evaluation requirements. 
(2)  Soil sample data. If the applicant's parcel lies within or partly within an area believed to contain poorly drained, very poorly drained, alluvial and/or floodplain soils (wetlands), the data shall show precisely where each specific soil type is found. Soil types identified must be consistent with the categories established by the National Cooperative Soils Survey of the United States Soil Conservation Service. 
(3)  Biological evaluation. If the affected property is believed to include any portion of a swamp, bog or marsh, the applicant may be required to submit an evaluation of the extent of the presence of plant species commonly associated with swamps, bogs and marshes. The applicant may also be requested to submit an evaluation of the probable effect of his proposed activity upon those plant species and upon indigenous animal life. 
(4)  Analysis of material to be deposited. The applicant may be required to describe any materials to be deposited on the affected property in terms of volume, composition and the possibility of erosion or leaching from deposited materials. 
(5)  A description of the proposed construction or the erection of structures on the affected property, including blueprints, engineering and architectural plans or designs, where available or reasonably obtainable. Such description should include the purposes of such construction or activity. 
(6)  A list of other property owners whose rights or interests may be or will be affected by the proposed activity. 
(7)  Watercourse characteristics. If the proposed activity upon the applicant's property may affect a watercourse lying within, partly within or flowing through or adjacent to the applicant's property, the applicant may be required to submit information relative to the present character and the projected impact of the proposed activity upon the watercourse. 
(f)  Decision on application. 
(1)  If the Agency finds, on the basis of the evidence before it, that a regulated activity is involved which may have a significant impact or major effect on the inland wetland or watercourse, the Agency shall docket such proposal for further investigation and public hearing. 
(2)  In the event that the Agency does not schedule a public hearing, the Agency shall render a final decision within sixty-five (65) days from the receipt of a complete application. The Agency shall notify the applicant, by certified mail, of its decision within fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision, and the Agency shall cause notice of its order in issuance or denial of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having general circulation in the municipality wherein the regulated area lies. Failure of the Agency to render a final decision within sixty-five (65) days from the receipt of a complete application shall constitute approval of such application. 
(g)  Public hearings. 
(1)  All public hearings shall commence not later than sixty-five (65) days after the receipt of a complete application. 
(2)  Notice of the hearing shall be published at least twice at intervals of not less than two (2) days, the first not more than fifteen (15) days and not fewer than ten (10) days and the last not less than two (2) days before the date set for the hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in each town where the affected wetlands or watercourses are located. All applications, maps and documents relating to this hearing shall be open for public inspection at the office of the Agency. Notices of hearings shall be sent to the applicant, adjacent and other known affected property owners and to all known interested parties and groups, but any defect in such notice by mail shall not affect the validity of such hearing. At such hearing any person or persons may appear and be heard. 
(3)  Where possible, public hearings shall be completed in a single session. However, the hearing may be continued (to a date certain) where necessary for the full development of the evidence or for the full and adequate participation of the parties or for such other substantial purposes. In no case shall continuances be used as a device for delay. 
(h)  Review of application by other bodies. 
(1)  The Agency may, where it deems necessary, submit one (1) copy of the application to the County Soil and Water Conservation District for review. Such submission shall be made at least thirty (30) days from the receipt of a complete application, but failure to receive a written review from the Soil and Water Conservation District should not delay a public hearing or prejudice the final decision. 
(2)  The Agency may, where it deems necessary, submit one (1) copy of the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency or similar body in any municipality whose border lies within five hundred (500) feet of any wetland or watercourse that may be affected by the proposed activity, but failure to receive a written reply shall not delay a public hearing or prejudice the final decision. 
(i)  If the Agency finds that an activity for which it has granted a permit has had a more severe impact or effect on the inland wetland or watercourse than was projected by the applicant or does not, in fact, involve a permitted use, the Agency may revoke such permit, pursuant to Section 6-232(b), and require the permittee to submit a new application for review.

(5)  The availability of preferable alternative locations on the subject parcel or, in the case of activity of sufficient magnitude, the availability of other reasonable locations. 
(6)  The availability of further technical improvements or safeguards which could feasibly be added to the plan or action. 
(7)  The possibility of further avoiding reduction of the wetland's or watercourse's natural capacity to support desirable biological life, prevent flooding, supply water, control sedimentation and/or prevent erosion, assimilate wastes, facilitate drainage and provide recreation and open space. 
(8)  The extent to which the exercise of property rights and the public benefit derived from such use may or may not outweigh or justify the possible degradation of the inland wetland or watercourse, the interference with the exercise of other property rights and the impairment or endangerment of public health, safety or welfare. 
(b)  Action shall be taken on applications within sixty-five (65) days after the completion of a public hearing. The Agency shall inform the applicant of its decision in granting, with or without conditions, or in denying a permit, by certified mail, within fifteen (15) days of the date of such decision. The Agency shall cause notice of the issuance or denial of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality wherein the wetland or watercourse lies. Failure of the Agency to take action on an application within sixty-five (65) days after the completion of a public hearing shall constitute approval of such application.

Sec. 6-235. - Establishment and amendment of boundaries. 
(a)  The Agency shall establish boundaries of the inland wetlands and watercourses of the town in the following manner: The Agency shall make an inventory of the wetlands and watercourses within the town. The Agency shall cause the boundaries of all such wetlands and watercourses to be shown upon maps or aerial photographs to such scale as the Agency shall determine and with such accuracy that they will represent a Class D survey. The Agency may use any information presented in any application in establishing such boundaries. At such time as the Agency determines that such maps or aerial photographs sufficiently accurately delineate all or substantially all of the wetlands or watercourses within the town, the Agency shall docket such maps or aerial photographs for a public hearing which shall be held in the manner provided in Section 22a-42a of the General Statutes, as amended. Such boundary maps may include such reasonable setbacks or margins surrounding designated areas as the Agency determines to be necessary for the full protection of the inland wetlands and watercourses. 
(b)  Inland wetlands are defined in Section 6-223(s) of these regulations. Any person who disputes the designation of any part of his land as a regulated area upon any boundary maps or aerial photographs established pursuant to Section 6-235(a) hereof shall claim exemption from these regulations at a public meeting. 
(1)  In order to challenge the regulation of all or any portion of his parcel of land as a regulated area, the applicant shall submit with his application a report by a soil scientist that the subject parcel or a portion of it does not have a soil type classified by the National Cooperative Soils Survey as poorly drained, very poorly drained, alluvial or floodplain; or

Any person who does not deliver such written request within twenty (20) days shall be deemed to have waived contesting liability, and the Director shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer.

(j)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form, and with such methods of proof, as he/she deems fair and appropriate.

Sec. 6A-5. - Violations and penalties. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the Chief of Police to determine whether or not any violation of this chapter has occurred, and, if so, to notify the Distributor to correct such violation.

Such notice of violation shall be served upon the Distributor in the same manner as a summons; or it may be telephoned to the Distributor at the telephone number designated by the Distributor as provided in Section 6A-2(b) and confirmed in a written notice, mailed by certified mail, with return receipt requested to the address designated by the distributor as provided in Section 6A-2(b) above. During such three-day period, the Distributor shall have a right to apply for a hearing before a hearing officer designated by the Chief of Police to determine whether or not such violation has occurred and if so, whether it warrants removal of the newsrack prior to final determination of any appeal. At such hearing, the Distributor shall have the right to examine the evidence upon which the hearing officer acted, to cross-examine any witnesses who may have appeared before him and to offer any evidence which may tend to show that the subject newsrack does not violate any provision of this chapter or that the claimed violation is not of a nature which warrants removal prior to final determination. The hearing officer shall promptly review such evidence, notify the Distributor in writing of his decision with respect thereto and, if necessary, afford the distributor a reasonable time period with which to comply with such determination. 
(b)  If said violation is not corrected within the original three-day notice period, or such further period as may be contained in the determination of the hearing officer, the Chief of Police shall direct the Town Department of Public Works to remove such newsrack and place it in storage in a secure place. The cost of removal and storage shall be billed to the Distributor, and in the event of nonpayment, a civil suit for money damages may be brought by the Town.

(RTM, § 5, 9/19/83.) 
Sec. 6A-6. - Appeals. 
(a)  Any distributor or other person aggrieved by a finding, determination, notice or action taken under the provisions of Section 6A-5 above, may appeal directly to the Board of Selectmen. An appeal shall be made in writing, and must be filed within three (3) days after the receipt of written notice of any protested decision or action, with the Board of Selectmen by a letter of appeal briefly stating therein the basis for such appeal. A hearing thereon shall be scheduled to be had on a date no more than ten (10) days after receipt of such letter. The appellant shall be given at least five (5) business days notice of the time and place of the hearing. The Board of Selectmen shall give the appellant, or any other interested person a reasonable opportunity to be heard in order to show cause why the determination or action appealed from should not be upheld. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to show that such determination or action was not supported by substantial evidence. The Board of Selectmen shall make a final determination at the conclusion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as is practicable. In the event that a Distributor is successful in reversing a determination that the claimed violation was of a nature which warranted removal pending a final determination, no fee shall be imposed for the removal and storage of the newsrack which was the subject of the appeal, and no fine shall be due. The Distributor may bring a civil suit to review the decision of the Board of Selectmen. 
(b)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be interpreted to limit or impair the exercise by the Town of Greenwich of its police power to remove any newsrack which presents a clear and present danger of imminent personal injury or property damage to users of the public rights-of-way.

(1)  No person shall cause or permit the emission of particulate matter in any one hour from any source in excess of the amount shown in the Table below for the process weight rate allocated to such source, with the exception of sources specified in Subsection (b). 
TABLE 
Process Weight Rate lbs./hr. Emission Rate lbs./hr. Process Weight Rate lbs./hr. Emission Rate lbs./hr. 50 0.36 60,000 29.60 100 0.55 80,000 31.19 500 1.53 120,000 33.28 1,000 2.25 160,000 34.85 5,000 6.34 200,000 36.11 10,000 9.73 400,000 40.35 20,000 14.99 1,000,000 46.72  
(2)  Interpolation of the data in the Table for the process weight rates up to 60,000 lbs./hr. shall be accomplished by the use of the equation: 
E = 3.59 P 0.62 P equal to or less than 30 tons/hr. and interpolation and extrapolation of the data for process weight rates in excess of 60,000 lbs./hr. shall be accomplished by the use of the equation: 
E = 17.31 P 0.16 P greater than 30 tons/hr. Where: E = Emissions in pounds per hour. 
P = Process weight rate in tons per hour. 
(3)  For the purposes of this Section, process weight per hour is the total weight of all materials introduced into any specific process that may cause any emission of particulate matter. Solid fuels charged will be considered as part of the process weight, but liquid and gaseous fuels and combustion air will not. For a cyclical or batch operation, the process weight per hour will be derived by dividing the total process weight by the number of hours in one complete operation from the beginning of any given process to the completion thereof, excluding any time during which the equipment is idle. For a continuous operation, the process weight per hour will be derived by dividing the process weight for a typical period of time by the length of that period of time. 
(4)  Where the nature of any process or operation or the design of any equipment is such as to permit more than one interpretation of this regulation, the interpretation that results in the minimum value for allowable emission shall apply. 
(5)  For purposes of the Section, the total process weight from all similar process units at a plant or premises shall be used for determining the maximum allowable emission of particulate matter that passes through a stack or stacks. 
(6)  For the purposes of this Section, when any material undergoes a series of operations which are capable of emitting particulate matter and which employ any combination of machines, equipment, or other devices used for processing the material either continuously or in batches, the total process weight for the series of operations shall be the weight of materials introduced to the series as a whole. Any material which is the product of any operation in the series shall not be counted as part of the process weight for any other operation in the series. 
(b)  Process industries-specific. 
(1)  Emission standards (iron cupolas). No person shall cause or allow the operation of any iron foundry cupola unless such cupola is equipped with gas-cleaning devices and so operated as to remove eighty-five percent (85%) by weight of all particulate matter in the cupola discharge gases, or to release not more than eight-tenths (8/10) of a pound of particulate matter per thousand pounds of discharge gas, whichever is more stringent. Gases, vapors and gas-entrained effluents from such cupolas shall be incinerated at a minimum temperature of 1300 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of not less than three-tenths (3/10) of a second. 
(2)  Emission standards (hot mix asphalt plants). No person shall cause or allow the emission of particulate matter from hot mix asphalt plants in excess of three-tenths (3/10) of a pound per one thousand (1,000) pounds of discharge gas. 
(3)  Emission standards (foundry sand). No person shall cause or allow the operation of a foundry sand process unless such process is equipped with fugitive dust control facilities with collection efficiency of at least ninety percent (90%). 
(4)  Emission standards (concrete batching). No person shall cause or allow the operation of a concrete batching process unless such process is equipped with fugitive dust control facilities with collection efficiency of ninety percent (90%) or 0.02 pounds per cubic yard of concrete, whichever results in less emission. 
(Ords. & Reg., § 2-16.3.8, 9/11/68.)

The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month period, assessments against the same business establishment may be accrued and filed as one (1) record of assessment. The clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and court costs of eight dollars ($8.00), against such business establishment in favor of the municipality. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such business establishment. 
    A business establishment against whom a penalty has been entered pursuant to this Ordinance [Article] is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in the amount equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes section 52-259, at the Superior Court facility designated by the Chief Court Administrator, which shall entitle such business establishment to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the Superior Court.

(1)  Statutory authority; age qualification. Pursuant to General Statutes § 12-129n property tax relief shall be provided to any resident of the town with respect to real property occupied by such resident as his or her principal residence for which the resident is liable for taxes as owner or as tenant for life or years under General Statutes § 12-48, who meets the qualifying total annual income herein and (1) who is sixty-five (65) years of age or over, (2) whose spouse, living with the resident is sixty-five (65) years of age or over, or (3) who is sixty (60) years of age or over and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer receiving relief in the town under this section at the time of his or her death. The ages specified in this section shall have been attained by December 31 preceding the application for tax relief under this ordinance [section]. 
(2)  Taxpayer qualification. Residents or spouses qualifying for tax relief under this section must be taxpayers of real property located in the town for one (1) year immediately preceding their receipt of tax benefits under this section and meet the requirements set forth in subsection (11) of this section with respect to the qualifying total annual income allowable for their federal income tax year preceding the year in which application is made for tax relief under this section. 
(3)  Other relief. Prior to the granting of property tax relief, such person must first have applied for tax relief under any other statute for which he or she is eligible and shall certify to the assessor and tax collector the tax credits received thereunder. No property tax relief granted under this section, together with any property tax relief received by any such person under all applicable statutes shall exceed, in the aggregate seventy-five (75) percent of the total amount of the tax which would, except for those applicable statutes and this section, be laid against the person applying for tax relief hereunder. 
(4)  Limit on abatement. The total credit and deferral abatement of property tax revenue which may be granted in each tax year by the town pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be set by the Board of Estimate and Taxation at the time it sets the mill rate for such tax year at an amount which is (a) not less than the lesser of (1) five hundred seventy thousand dollars ($570,000.00) or (2) the amount of the tax relief for approved applications and (b) not greater than an amount, equal to one-half of one (1/2) percent of the total real property tax levied in the town in the current tax year. Such tax relief granted to eligible persons for any fiscal year shall be decreased if necessary to keep the total amount of the town tax relief within such limit by applying such decrease ratably to the relief for the eligible persons with the highest qualifying total annual income and relief determined under subsections (6) and (11) and then if no relief is left for persons with such income and relief, by applying the decrease ratably to the relief for the persons with the next highest income and relief and so on for the others, until the decrease that is required to stay within such limit is met. 
(5)  Principal residence requirement. For purposes of this section the principal residence requirement in subsection (1) shall be met if the resident seeking qualification shall have maintained residence in the property for which tax relief is being sought for at least one hundred eighty-three (183) days during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the filing of an application hereunder and does not otherwise qualify as a resident of any other country, state, municipality or territory. 
(6)  Qualifying total annual income. Qualifying total annual income for tax relief under subsection (11) of this section shall be reviewed and determined by the assessor on the basis of amounts listed in the computation of total income for federal income tax purposes furnished by the taxpayer for the year preceding the filing of an application for tax relief hereunder of the applying individual, if unmarried, or jointly, if married, regardless of whether or not separate federal income tax returns were filed by such person or his or her spouse and shall be adjusted in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(a)  Included in income. Qualifying total annual income shall include income from the following sources, whether or not such sources were included in amounts listed for the computation of total income in a federal income tax return, and shall therefore be adjusted and determined by the assessor to the extent such amounts are not included as total income in a federal income tax return: 
1.  Wages, bonuses, commissions, gratuities and fees, self-employment net income; 
2.  Gross Social Security, Federal Supplemental Security Income, payment for jury duty (excluding travel allowance);

5.  Black Lung payments; 
6.  Interest or proceeds resulting from gifts received;

9.  Pensions, including veterans' and railroad retirement; 
10.  Severance pay; Unemployment compensation; 
11.  Worker's compensation; 
12.  Alimony; 
13.  Capital gains, provided that, to the extent there is no capital gain, qualifying total annual income shall not be decreased by capital losses; 
14.  Partnership income, provided that, to the extent there is no net income, qualifying total annual income shall not be decreased by partnership net income losses; 
(b)  Excluded from income. Qualifying total annual income shall exclude income from the following sources, whether or not such sources were included in amounts listed for the computation of total income in a federal income tax return or under subsection (a) above and shall therefore be adjusted and determined by the assessor to the extent that such amounts are included in a federal income tax return or under subsection (a) above: 
1.  Social Security payments specifically for a dependent person or minor child; 
2.  Casualty loss reimbursements by insurance companies; 
3.  Gifts, bequests or inheritances, except for any interest or other income produced by the gift, bequest or inheritance;

6.  Life insurance proceeds; 
7.  For a married homeowner whose spouse is a resident of a health care or nursing home facility and who is receiving payment related to such spouse under Title XIX Medicaid, total income shall not include the spouse's Social Security income, provided that the following has been submitted to the assessor on the facility's letterhead and signed by the administrator or other nursing home official:

No tax relief shall be given under this section to any person who has delinquent taxes to the town from real property, personal property or motor vehicles, including capital assessments or user charges owed to the town which have not been paid in full or brought current by June 1 preceding the fiscal year for which tax relief shall be granted. For purposes of this section, abated taxes shall not be considered delinquent. 
(8)  Form of application. The form of application for property tax relief under this ordinance [section] shall: (a) be made by affidavit on forms provided by the assessor and accompanied by documentation of all qualifying income, including a copy of the applicant's most recent federal tax return for the taxpayer's fiscal year immediately preceding the town's fiscal year for which tax relief is being requested and (b) state the qualifying information set forth in the preceding sections of this ordinance [section], whether or not the applicant has previously applied or is currently applying for any other tax relief for the elderly or disabled under any state statute. For those persons not required by law to file a federal tax return, an affidavit from such persons shall be required attesting to the fact that they are not required to file a tax return. In the case of an application for tax deferral as provided under this ordinance [section] the assessor shall take from the applicant, who shall be an individual and not a trust, an agreement in writing, signed, witnessed and acknowledged as required for a conveyance of land, containing the street address and land records volume and page of the deed to the property to the applicant or other legal description, that states the obligation to repay the deferred taxes and expressly grants to the town a security lien therefor on such real estate, which agreement shall be recorded in the land records with the lien filed by the tax collector in accordance with subsection (11)(b) hereof. The tax assessor shall provide the applicant for a tax deferral written notice that if the applicant's property is mortgaged, entering into this agreement may violate the mortgage covenants and the applicant should contact his or her mortgage lender. 
(9)  Filing dates. An application for property tax relief under this ordinance [section], including any required affidavit and documentation, shall be filed by mail or delivered in person to the assessor's office not earlier than February 1, nor later than May 15 to obtain property tax relief for the next fiscal year. For those persons who have sought and received by May 15 an extension of time to file a tax return, the application must nevertheless be filed by May 15 and a copy of the tax return must be received by the assessor's office by June 15 or the application will be denied. If the qualifying total annual income for the year following that contained in the application remains less than the limit of the category approved for a resident under subsection (11) then that resident shall not be required to file an application in the next following year but shall only be required to file an application biennially and the assessor may rely on the approved application on file to continue the tax relief accordingly. Otherwise, based on changes for such following year in qualifying total annual income that exceed the limit of the category approved for a resident or for a claim that the resident be allowed a larger relief based on a lower income category under subsection (11), the resident shall notify the assessor of such change and, if still qualifying for property tax relief, shall file again annually, by the dates set forth in this subsection. 
(10)  Assessment limit. The property tax relief available hereunder shall be available for one (1) residence only collectively for each applicant and spouse and shall not be available to any residence with an assessed value in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the highest median assessed value of residences sold during each of the prior assessment years, October 1 to September 30, since the inception of the last town-wide revaluation as calculated by the assessor. 
(11)  Computation of credit or deferral. The tax relief provided by this section shall be elected by the applicant, subject to subsection (3), as either a credit, as provided in the following subparagraph (a), or a deferral, as provided in the following subparagraph (b), but not both: 
(a)  Tax Credit. 
1.  The computation of the amount of property tax credit hereunder for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2009, shall be determined on the following graduated basis: 
Qualifying Total Annual Income Property Tax Credit Less than $24,000.00 $1,900.00 $24,000.00-$36,000.00 $1,300.00 $36,001.00-$50,000.00 $1,000.00 $50,001.00-$60,000.00 $500.00  
2.  For fiscal years commencing July 1, 2010, and following, the amount of tax credit shall be adjusted by a percentage change from the prior year as follows: 
(i)  In a fiscal year in which a tax assessment revaluation becomes effective, the percentage change shall be the product of the new mill rate times the new grand list divided by the product of the prior grand list times the prior mill rate, minus one (1). 
Examble: ;b4;Prior grand list ..... $20 Billion 
Prior mill rate ..... 12 mills 
New grand list ..... $40 Billion 
New mill rate ..... 6.2 mills 
Benefit change 
= ((6.2 mills x $40 Billion)/(12 mills x $20 Billion)) - 1 
= ($248 million/$240 million) - 1 
= .03333 or 3.333 percent increase 
(ii)  In a fiscal year in which a tax assessment revaluation does not become effective the percentage change shall be the same as the percentage change in the mill rate from the prior year. 
(b)  Tax Deferral. 
1.  The amount of tax deferral hereunder for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2010, and thereafter that persons with a qualifying total annual income of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00) or less may apply for shall be three thousand dollars ($3,000.00). 
2.  The amount of tax deferred shall be reimbursed to the town on the death of the taxpayer or transfer of the property as provided in subsections (12) and (13) hereunder and shall be subject to the following: 
(i)  The tax deferred shall be subject to an interest charge equal to the nominal rate for the United States Treasury security ten-year constant maturity quoted on an investment basis in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release as of each July 1, or the first business day thereafter, plus two hundred (200) basis points (two percent (2%)), 
(ii)  The interest rate will change annually, shall become effective July 1 and remain in effect for the twelve-month period through and including June 30 and shall compound annually, 
(iii)  Interest shall accrue from the date of deferral to the date of payment, and 
(iv)  The cumulative amount of deferred taxes plus interest may be repaid in whole at any time. 
3.  Once the amount including interest that is cumulatively deferred for any property exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the assessed valuation of that property or the taxpayer's prorated assessed valuation of that property as determined by the assessor under subsections (14) or (15) hereof the taxpayer for that property shall no longer quality for a tax deferral. 
4.  Upon the approval of an application for deferral the assessor shall forward notification of the approval together with the agreement specified in subsection (8) hereof to the tax collector who shall file in the land records the agreement together with a tax lien on the property which shall become effective and be continued in the same manner as with other tax liens for the cumulative amount of deferred taxes plus the interest specified herein. 
(c)  For fiscal years commencing July 1, 2011, and following the qualifying total annual income shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index affecting the town designated "CPI-W NY-NJ-CT-PA" rounded down to the nearest five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(12)  Death of taxpayer. Upon the death of any person entitled to tax relief pursuant to this section, the tax relief hereunder shall end the following June 30, unless his or her spouse is otherwise qualified hereunder. Any deferred tax plus interest shall be paid by the expiration of two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of death and if not paid shall become delinquent from the expiration of such time limit in the same manner as for delinquent taxes. 
(13)  Transfer of property. If any person entitled to tax relief hereunder transfers the property with respect to which the tax relief hereunder has been granted to someone other than a spouse otherwise qualified hereunder, the tax relief shall be suspended as of the date of transfer, the deferred tax plus interest shall thereupon become due and if not paid within thirty (30) days shall become a delinquent tax from the date of transfer. The nonqualifying transferee of such property shall be liable for any such unpaid taxes and shall pay the town a prorated share of taxes that become due and owing as provided by General Statutes § 12-81a. 
(14)  Proration of relief. The property tax relief provided for in this section may, in any case where title to real property is recorded in the name of the taxpayer or his or her spouse and any other person or persons, be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such taxpayer or spouse or, if such property is a multiple family dwelling, such relief may be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such property occupied by the taxpayer. 
(15)  Cooperatives. Persons qualifying in accordance with age and income requirements of this ordinance [section] shall be eligible if they are unit owners and occupiers of a cooperative. The amount of annual property tax relief in accordance with this section to any such person shall be determined in relation to an assumed amount of property tax liability applicable to the assessed value for the dwelling unit which such person owns and occupies as determined by the assessor which may be based on the number of cooperative shares attributable to the unit compared to the total number of shares in the cooperative. For purposes of this section the assessor shall determine the assumed amount of property tax liability applicable to the assessed value for the dwelling unit of each such person who is otherwise eligible under this section, but such determination shall not constitute a tax bill for purposes of property taxation of such cooperative or any individual dwelling unit thereof. Annually not later than the first day of June, the assessor, upon the basis of an application for such relief, shall determine, with respect to the assessment list for the assessment year commencing October 1 immediately preceding, the portion of the assessed value of the entire cooperative, as included in such assessment list, attributable to the dwelling unit occupied by such person. The assumed property tax liability for purposes of determining the amount of such relief shall be the product of such assessed value and the mill rate in the town as determined for purposes of property tax imposed on said assessment list for the assessment year commencing October 1 immediately preceding. The amount of relief to which such person shall be entitled for such assessment year shall be equivalent to the amount of tax reduction for which such person would qualify, considering such assumed property tax liability to be the actual property tax applicable to such person's dwelling unit and such person as liable for the payment of such tax. 
(16)  Procedures. The tax collector and assessor shall prescribe with regard to their respective duties under this section, such forms and procedures as may be necessary to implement this section. The assessor, in addition, shall take such steps as are necessary to satisfactorily establish the facts as to the qualifying income of an applicant for benefits under this section by requesting and reviewing income tax forms filed therewith and any additional evidence of qualifying income, which the assessor may require. This documentation shall not be open to public inspection. The assessor may deny the application of a person who fails to provide information required by the assessor that is necessary to determine eligibility. 
(17)  Effective date. This ordinance [section], as amended, shall be effective starting with applications accepted February 1, 2010, for tax relief for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2010. 
(18)  Expiration. All provisions of this ordinance [section], as amended, shall cease to be effective on June 30, 2019, unless an ordinance extending this ordinance [section] is properly submitted to the Board of Selectmen, the Board of Estimate and Taxation and the Representative Town Meeting and approved prior to that date.

(b)  A qualifying member is herewith defined as a volunteer firefighter in good standing as determined by the Chief of the Greenwich Fire Department, pursuant to the accountability criteria established by the Greenwich Fire Department (excluding honorary members), who is a resident of the Town, and has submitted a written statement, certified to by the Volunteer District Chiefs, which includes the name and address of the firefighter, and states that he/she has served as a volunteer firefighter for the immediately preceding calendar year, (not including departmental leave, military service, or injury under workers' compensation) so as to qualify said member for said abatement for each fiscal year. 
(c)  The Chief of the Greenwich Fire Department shall compile a list of all qualifying members and submit said list to the Greenwich Tax Assessor by April 1 of each year. 
(d)  Any real and/or personal property taxes owed to the Town by such volunteer firefighter shall be abated in an amount equal to the lesser of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or the total amount of real and/or personal property taxes owed to the Town for such fiscal year.

Failure to make use of this tax abatement because of Grand List property of insufficient value shall not be construed so as to create any carry-over tax abatement credit for use in subsequent fiscal years.

The sale or transfer of any Grand List property by a qualifying member shall disqualify said property from abatement application for the remainder of the then fiscal year, on a pro-rata basis.

If the operator of said vehicle is known by the Traffic Division of the Police Department to be different from the registered owner of said vehicle and if the address of said operator is known, the town may also send a notice to said operator in addition to that sent to the owner which shall contain the information set forth in this subsection that is sent to the owner, plus notice that if the nonowner operator wishes to contest the liability for the parking violations listed against the registration of said vehicle, he shall furnish evidence of his relationship as an agent or lessee of the owner in any request for a hearing. 
(d)  If the person who is sent notice pursuant to Subsection (c) wishes to admit liability for the alleged violations, he may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail to the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. If a written demand for hearing is not delivered in person or by mail within ten (10) days of the date of the first notice provided in Subsection (c), liability shall be deemed to have been admitted for the parking violations listed against the registration of said motor vehicle, and the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department shall place said vehicle on a list of vehicles subject to removal or immobilization when found in the areas set forth in Subsection (a). 
(e)  Any owner of said motor vehicle, his authorized agent or lessee, who makes a timely request for a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of notice, provided that the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the initial notices of violations issued by a policeman or other issuing officer shall be filed and retained by the town, be deemed to be a business record within the scope of Connecticut General Statutes § 52-180 and be evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the policeman or issuing officer shall be required at the hearing if such person so requests. An owner or his authorized agent or lessee wishing to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing any may present evidence in his behalf. A designated town official, other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the town. If such owner, his authorized agent or lessee fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against the registration of said vehicle upon a finding of proper notice and liability for the parking violations under the applicable town ordinances. The hearing officer may accept from such owner, his authorized agent or lessee copies of police reports, Motor Vehicle Department documents and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. Proof of the registration number of the motor vehicle involved shall be prima facie evidence in all proceedings provided for in this section that the owner of such vehicle was the operator thereof, provided that liability of a lessee under Connecticut General Statutes § 14-107 shall apply. The hearing officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that neither the owner nor lessee is liable for the violations listed against the registration of said vehicle, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he determines that the owner or lessee is liable for the violations, he shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against the registration of said motor vehicle as provided by the applicable ordinances of the town. 
(f)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail a notice of the assessment to the registered owner of said motor vehicle with the direction that payment in the full amount of the assessment be made to the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department. If a lessee of the motor vehicle is known to be involved, said notice shall also be sent to such lessee. If said assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days after said mailing, the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department shall place said vehicle on a list of vehicles subject to removal or immobilization when found in the areas set forth in Subsection (a). 
(g)  Any vehicle placed on a list to be removed or immobilized in accordance with this section which is found within the areas set forth in Subsection (a) may be removed or caused to be removed by or under the direction of a member of the Police Department by towing or otherwise. In addition to, or in lieu of, towing, any such vehicle may be immobilized in such manner as to prevent its operation, except that no such vehicle shall be immobilized by any means other than by the use of a device or other mechanism which will cause no damage to such vehicle unless it is moved while such device or mechanism is in place. In any case involving immobilization or removal of a vehicle pursuant to this section, such member of the Police Department shall cause to be placed on such vehicle, in a conspicuous manner, notice sufficient to warn any individual to the effect that any attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle. Said notice shall also provide that pursuant to this section the registered owner of the vehicle, his authorized agent or lessee has a right to a hearing to determine the validity of such immobilization, towing, storage, related charges, parking fines and penalties. A copy of this section shall be provided to the motor vehicle owner, his authorized agent or lessee who presents himself at the Traffic Division of the Police Department to obtain the release of said vehicle. 
(h)  Within twenty-four (24) hours after towing or immobilization, the Police Department shall notify the owner of such vehicle and, if known, the operator or lessee of the fact of its towing or immobilization, the place where it may be recovered and the conditions under which it will be released pursuant to this section. 
(i)  The owner, his authorized agent or lessee of any vehicle taken into custody or immobilized shall be allowed to repossess or to secure the release of said vehicle by payment, to the order of the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department, of the cost of towing charges; the cost of any storage charges for each day, plus portion of any day, that such vehicle is so stored in excess of the first twenty-four (24) hours and all sums legally due for any town parking violations issued and outstanding against the registration of said motor vehicle. 
(j)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (i), when any vehicle has been taken into custody or immobilized, the owner, his authorized agent or lessee shall be allowed to secure the release of said vehicle, upon filing with the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department of written demand to contest the owner's and, if applicable, lessee's liability before a parking violations hearing officer; a written acknowledgment that the owner and, if applicable, lessee is aware that pursuant to this section and the General Statutes that such a demand may ultimately result in an assessment and judgment against the owner and lessee; and a bond with a surety company authorized to do business in this state, or a cash bond, in an amount sufficient to cover any towing and storage charges. Any owner, his authorized agent or lessee who so requests such a hearing shall be given written notice of the list of violations against the registration of said vehicle and the amount of the fines, penalties, costs, fees or charges due. The owner as represented by himself, his authorized agent or, if applicable, lessee shall be accorded the procedural process set forth in Connecticut General Statutes § 7-152b(e) through (g) and shall be subject to the civil judgment remedies and liabilities of that statute, prosecuted under the direction of the Town Attorney. The bond filed as security for any towing and storage charges shall only be released if the hearing officer dismisses the matter; the Superior Court sustains an appeal as provided in Connecticut General Statutes §7-152b; or the towing and storage charges are paid in full. 
(k)  When any motor vehicle has been taken into custody, towed and stored, the owner, his authorized agent or lessee may elect not to comply with the provisions of Subsection (i) or (j) for the release of said vehicle and may seek an expedited release of said vehicle by filing with the officer in charge of the Traffic Division of the Police Department a written demand to contest the owner's or, if applicable, lessee's liability on an expedited basis before a parking violations hearing officer; and a written acknowledgment that the owner and, if applicable, lessee is aware that pursuant to this section and the General Statutes that such a demand may ultimately result in an assessment and judgment against the owner and lessee. Any owner, his authorized agent or lessee who requests such an expedited hearing shall be given written notice of the list of violations against the registration of said vehicle and the amount the fines, penalties, costs fees or charges due; and a hearing date not later than two (2) days after the written demand for an expedited hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded. Said owner as represented by himself, his authorized agent or, if applicable, lessee shall be accorded the procedural process set forth in Connecticut General Statutes § 7-152b(e) through (g) and shall be subject to the civil judgment remedies and liabilities of that statute, prosecuted under the direction of the Town Attorney, except that the hearing and decision by the Hearing Officer shall be given not later than two (2) days after the written demand for an expedited hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded, unless a continuance is requested by the owner of the vehicle, his authorized agent or lessee. Said motor vehicle which has been taken into custody, towed and stored shall only be released if the hearing officer dismisses the matter; the owner, his authorized agent or lessee, upon filing a petition to reopen assessment under Connecticut General Statutes § 7-152b, files a bond with a surety company authorized to do business in this state or a cash bond in an amount sufficient to cover any towing and storage charges; the Superior Court sustains an appeal as provided in Connecticut General Statutes § 7-152b; or the towing and storage charges are paid in full. 
(l)  The above procedures shall not limit in any way the ability of the Police Department to take into custody, tow and store any vehicle with less than five (5) unpaid parking violations to which the above procedures have not been applied when it is parked in the areas set forth in Subsection (a) in violation of any provision of any municipal ordinance, state law, rule or regulation and when, in the opinion of the investigating police officer, said vehicle should be removed to protect the public safety. In such event the procedures for the release of said vehicle set forth in this section shall apply. The provisions of this section shall also not be interpreted to restrict in any way the ability of the Police Department to issue summonses for parking violations. 
(m)  No vehicle which has been taken into custody or immobilized shall be released until the owner, his authorized agent or lessee has established his identity and right to the vehicle and has signed a proper receipt therefor. 
(n)  Any motor vehicle owner or operator who shall, after having had his vehicle towed or immobilized, remove such vehicle without complying with the provisions of this section shall, in addition to the charges provided for in this section, be liable for any damage done to the immobilization device or mechanism and be subject to a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

Town Agencies having jurisdiction to inspect the facility annually or as
necessary.

with each prospective resident before he or she takes occupancy.
C. A copy of the proposed contract between the Responsible Agent and

(14) Group Day Care Homes  Special Requirements: (10/2/89)
(a) It is the intent of these regulations to allow care and protection for young children in
a home-like atmosphere by allowing an accessory use to a Resident-occupied single
family home for operating under State of Connecticut licensing, a Group Day Care
Home. It is also the intent of these regulations to prevent the intrusion of commercial
uses in a residential zone, in accordance with the guidelines of the Towns Land Use
Plan, by establishing the use as accessory to resident occupied use; and to prevent
a concentration of facilities and uses which could adversely impact a neighborhoods
character, property values or increase or contribute to the creation of an institutional,
or more traffic intensive atmosphere; and to promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
(b) Each Group Day Care Home shall meet the following requirements:
(1) Compliance with all state licensing requirements for Group Day Care Homes;
(2) One (1) on-site parking space exclusively for residential use;
§6-94 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-94
9-4
(3) Two (2) on-site parking spaces for non-resident staff members;
(4) No exterior features of the Group Day Care Home shall distinguish it from other
single-family dwellings in the area;

at any one time;

during each twenty-four (24) hour period, and no overnight accommodations
for children or staff shall be permitted.
(10) Application for Special Permit and Site Plan in accordance with Sections 6-13,
6-15 and 6-17 shall be required and standards of Sec. 6-15 and 6-17 shall be
met. (10/2/89)
(15) Resident Medical Professional Office (2/8/94)
(a) The purpose of this amendment is to recognize that the office of a resident medical
professional is not a low impact use that can blend harmoniously into all residential
neighborhoods. This use involves high traffic generation and parking demand,
delivery of specialized supplies and materials, and creation of wastes requiring
unique handling and disposal. It has historically been allowed as an accessory use
in residential neighborhoods to bring an essential service close to where people live
but significant changes in medical practice make it necessary to be selective about
the location of the use to protect neighborhoods from adverse impacts that detract
from their residential character. The Special Permit allows the Commission to ensure
compatibility of a resident medical professional office with a neighborhood and
protection of the publics health, safety, and welfare and the value of property.
(b) A Resident Medical Professional Office with not more than two (2) non-resident
support personnel, such as a secretary, receptionist, aide or nurse provided that:
(1) Such use shall only be permitted on a lot in the RA-1 zone that is at least one
and one-half times the minimum required lot size and on a lot in the R-20 zone
or in the R-12 Zone that is at least twice the minimum required lot size and on
a lot in the R-7 or R-6 zone that is at least two and one-half times the minimum
required lot size;
(2) No such office shall occupy more than 700 square feet or 25% of the gross
floor area in the premises, whichever is smaller;
(3) Parking shall be governed by Section 6-158 (as amended) but shall not be
permitted in the front yard;
(4) There shall be screening in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section
6-180; and
(5) There shall be no other accessory use that might otherwise be permitted under
any section of these Regulations.
§6-95 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-95
9-5
Sec. 6-95. PERMITTED ACCESSORY USES.

R-12, R-7, R-6 and RMF zones: 600 square feet
In granting a Special Exception, in addition to considering all the standards of Sec. 6-
20(c), the Board of Appeals shall find in residential zones that the accessory structure by
virtue of its scale, design, size or location on the site is compatible with its zone and
individually or in combination with other accessory structures, maintains the appearance
of being subordinate to the principal structure. (1/1/87) (10/17/18)

Sec. 6-102. STATEMENT OF PURPOSES  ALL BUSINESS ZONES.
These business zone regulations are made in accordance with the Towns Plan of Development/Land
Use Plan, adopted in 1985, and are designed to implement the policies as contained therein and the
purposes set forth in the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut. Specifically, it is the intent of these
regulations: (6/11/86)
(a) To guide and control the type, amount, location and quality of business development in the
Town so that it will be in harmony with Greenwichs predominantly residential character.
(b) To concentrate business activities in existing commercial areas and assure that there will
continue to be available adequate land and building capacity to meet the retail and business
needs of the Towns present and ultimate future population; to assure that commercial areas
outside the central business district provide for the particular needs of the areas and
neighborhoods they are intended to serve. (6/11/86)
(c) To assure that the limited areas of the Town which have been found to be suitable in terms of
location, facilities and utilities to serve Greenwichs retail and service business needs are
reserved for this purpose and are not pre-empted for uses which do not serve a local function
or which can be more appropriately located elsewhere.
(d) To control the type, amount and location of business development, tying it closely to ultimate
population growth and the capacity of the Towns infra-structure; to encourage the most
economic use of existing and planned community services and facilities such as, but not limited
to, road network, water supply, storm drains, sewage disposal. (6/11/86)
(e) To provide greater shopping convenience and encourage pedestrian circulation by
concentrating local retail and business uses in uninterrupted shopping patterns in the Towns
existing business centers; to support the viability of the retail function within shopping districts
by assuring adequate ground floor storefront space for retail sales purposes. (6/11/86)
(f) To prevent business land uses from encroaching upon or otherwise disturbing areas planned
for residential use.
(g) To encourage in appropriate areas mixed residential and commercial uses. (6/11/86)
(h) To preserve the cultural heritage of the community, and to preserve the Towns historic
resources in conformance with Sec. 8-2 of the State Statutes. (4/5/82)
(i) To retain and enhance the environmental quality of business zones so as to sustain property
values and the viability of businesses. (6/11/86)
(j) To encourage preservation of existing housing stock in commercial areas and if dwellings are
displaced by conversion or new construction to encourage replacement; to encourage
protection and provision of below-market-rate housing. (6/11/86)
§6-103 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-103
9-20
Sec. 6-103. USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL LBR ZONES. (9/15/86;
9/28/2010)
(A) Purposes.
In addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the LBR zones is to protect and encourage
neighborhood-oriented retail development. These zones provide central but limited concentration of
complementary retail goods and personal services in convenient locations to meet the frequent recurring
needs of nearby residents.
The regulations are intended to provide a system of controls which are tailored to the needs of the
neighborhoods and give priority to neighborhood-serving activities; to control the distribution and
concentration of uses so as to avoid a proliferation of ground-floor non-retail uses which may threaten
the balance and variety of activities and the viability of the areas retail function; to discourage a significant
reduction in the total number of available storefront businesses or a break in storefront continuity, within
a neighborhood commercial district. An additional goal is to encourage housing, where appropriate, so
as to meet the diverse housing needs of the Towns residents as well as to provide a daytime market that
supports and strengthens the business community.
LBR zones do not depend on areas substantially larger than the neighborhood districts they are
designed to serve and they do not attract a significant part of their clientele from beyond the surrounding
neighborhood. The scale, design, character and uses of commercial buildings in the zones are intended
to be compatible with the scale, character and density of surrounding residential areas and to supply
desired goods and services, with particular emphasis on reserving an adequate amount of ground-floor
storefront space for retail businesses which display and stock goods for sale to consumers.
The LBR zone is divided into sub-categories. Most shopping areas can provide comparison goods
and services on a generalized or specialized basis to a neighborhood market area and in general are
more dependent upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure. A few shopping areas have less
potential for comparison goods and services, are less dependent on pedestrian traffic, and are designed
to provide a limited variety of convenience retail and personal services to the nearby community.
(B) Parking.
Notwithstanding other provisions in these regulations, no above-grade parking structure shall be
permitted. Subject to (C) below, underground parking may be permitted by Special Permit provided that
parking spaces required for Use Group 8 uses are surface spaces on the same level as street-level
businesses and are located to the rear of the structure, and provided that there is no access to
underground parking so as to break the continuity of storefront businesses, and no loss of municipal or
private surface parking presently existing within the district. In considering approval of underground
parking, the Commission shall consider the character of the area including existing uses, buildings and
open spaces; the relationship of the proposal in all its aspects including bulk and mass to the existing
character and purposes of the business district; the convenience to shoppers; and the impact on
continuity of shopping patterns.
(C) Height Limitations.
Notwithstanding other provisions in these regulations, the height of any structure shall not exceed
thirty-five feet as measured from the grade plane to the highest point of the building. Subject to Special
Permit, the elements and structures regulated under Sec. 6-127 may be permitted to exceed the height
established in this sub-section 6-103(C). (5/4/2005)
(D) Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
See Table, Sec. 6-205(b).
§6-103 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-103.1
9-21
(E) Ground Floor Uses
Except for access to and egress from upper floor permitted uses, uses on the ground floor shall be
limited to uses listed in Use Group 8, except for banks (including drive-up, or drive thru), financial services
facilities, Sales Agencies of real estate, employment, insurance or travel firms which are not permitted
on first floor of the LBR zones. ATM machines and access entrances to 2nd floor banks are not considered
financial services and may be located on the first floor in the LBR zones. These uses are considered
office uses and not retail uses. Other Group 8 uses shall occupy not less than 75% of the floor area of
the largest floor of the building. For the purposes of this provision, the ground floor shall be considered a
floor within 18 inches of mean curb elevation; if no floor occurs within this elevation, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall determine which floor of the building shall be treated as the ground floor.
Exceptions to ground floor Use Regulations are noted in (G) below. (4/14/2010; 9/28/2010)
(F) Upper Floor Uses
Uses permitted above the second floor shall be uses other than Use Group 2a or 8, but may include
storage incidental to first and second floor uses.
(G) Permitted Uses
Subject to (E) and (F) above the following uses are permitted:
Use Group 2a.
Use Group 3.
Use Group 8.
Sales Agencies of real estate, employment, insurance or travel firms shall be permitted only above
floors having other uses of Use Group 8.
(H) Within existing buildings in the LBR-1 and LBR-2 Zones, the following uses are permitted:
Fitness Clubs; Group Fitness Centers/Gyms; Day-Care Centers; Walk-in Medical Clinics; Sales
Agencies of Real Estate or Insurance; Art Galleries; and Schools, both profit and non-profit. A
special permit is required for any use which involved student drop-off. All uses shall provide a
storefront appearance for the occupied space as viewed from the adjacent street. (2/28/2019)
(3/1/2019)
(I) There shall be no display of merchandise or the placement of equipment used for an on-site
business activity permitted in the required parking area. (3/1/2019)
Sec. 6-103.1. USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CGBR ZONE (9/15/86;
9/28/2010)
(A) Purposes.
In addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the Central Greenwich Business-
Retail Zone is to serve as the prime retail and service area of the Town by accommodating shopping and
business needs in a greater variety and concentration than the neighborhood and local business zones.
The CGBR zone serves several functions: it provides convenience goods and services to all residential
areas of the Town, both the outlying sections and the close-in more densely built neighborhoods; it
provides comparison shopping goods and services on a generalized or specialized basis to the town§
6-103.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-103.1
9-22
wide and sub-regional market area; and it provides office uses to complement and support the business
uses.
The emphasis of the CGBR zone is upon protection of ground floor space for compatible retail uses,
and avoidance of a break in storefront continuity. Consequently, businesses in the zone are generally
dependent upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure. In addition to retail uses, a wide variety of
services and community functions is included to suit the broad and longer-term needs of residents and
customers.
An important goal of the CGBR zone is to provide for housing to meet the diverse needs of the Towns
residents, as well as to provide a night-time presence and a daytime market that supports and
strengthens the business community.
(B) Ground Floor Uses.
Except for access to and egress from upper floor permitted uses, uses on the ground floor shall be
limited to uses listed in Use Group 1 except for banks and financial services, (including drive up and drive
thru) and sales agencies of real estate, employment insurance or travel firms which are not permitted on
the first floor of the CGBR zone. These uses are only allowed on the upper floors if parking is provided
on site since these uses are considered office uses and not retail uses. ATM machines and bank
entrances to the 2nd floor are not considered financial services and may be located on the first floor in
the CGBR zone. Recreational facilities, fitness clubs, gyms and group fitness centers are not permitted
on the first floor of the CGBR zone and only in the Basement and on the upper floors if, in either case,
adequate parking is provided on site per Section 6-158 of the BZR. Other Use Group 1 uses shall occupy
not less than 75% of the floor area of the largest floor of the building. For the purposes of this provision,
the ground floor shall be considered a floor within 18 inches of mean curb elevation; if no floor occurs
within this elevation, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall determine which floor of the building shall be
treated as the ground floor. Public areas of a restaurant in the CGBR zone are restricted to the ground
floor (basement or second floor) may be used for food preparation and accessory non-public restaurant
uses. For the purposes of this section, a floor shall be considered the ground floor if it is located within
18 above or below mean curb elevation. (4/14/2010; 9/28/2010, 9/20/2013; 9/19/2017)
(C) Permitted Uses.
Subject to (B) above, the following uses are permitted:
Use Group 1  Allowed on ground and second floor only, except that below grade floor area
(basement) may be used provided that the number of floors of a building devoted to Use
Group 1 shall not exceed two, and the number of usable or habitable floors shall not be more
than three (3). (6/27/95)
Use Group 2a and 2b  Allowed on second floor only. (6/27/95)
Use Group 3  Allowed above ground floor. (6/27/95)
(D) Parking.
Above ground parking shall not be permitted within 60 feet of the street line of Greenwich Avenue or
Putnam Avenue.
All parking required in accordance with Section 6-158 shall meet the standards of Division 15 and
Division 18. (2/6/90)
The parking and loading requirements of Division 15 shall not be applicable to uses in Use Group 1
or Use Group 3 for any lot where the following conditions are met:
The lot shall have a rear building line as indicated by any map listed in the Schedule of Rear
Building Lines at the end of these regulations; and
§6-103.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-104
9-23
The total floor area of the building or buildings on said lot shall not exceed 15,000 square feet of
floor area.
Division 15 shall be applicable to all other buildings except that for Use Groups 1 and 3 the Planning
and Zoning Commission, upon application for Special Permit, may grant Special Permit authorizing a
lesser number of parking and loading spaces after consideration of the following:
(1) Any past reduction in the size of the subject lot resulting from the conveyance of land behind
a rear building line to the Town of Greenwich;
(2) Provision of off-site parking by way of contract or lease;
(3) Maintaining of existing buildings contributing to continuity of retail frontages;
(4) The standards of Sec. 6-15 and 6-17.
For purposes of this section gross floor area which is located on other than the ground floor and is
occupied or utilized by the following Use Group 1 uses shall be calculated as Use Group 2: banks; sales
agencies of real estate, employment, insurance or travel firms; non-profit, multi-service social work
agencies. (2/6/90)
(E) Below Grade Floor.
In the CGBR zone below grade (basement) usable or habitable floor area accessible to the public
shall be counted as a story of the building. In such building the number of usable or habitable floors shall
not be more than three (3). (6/27/95)
(F) There shall be no display of merchandise or the placement of equipment used for an on-site
business activity permitted in the required parking area. (9/28/2010)
Sec. 6-104. USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LB ZONE. (3/21/2000)
(A) Purposes.
In addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the LB zone is to provide for greater
variety of retail, service, community and business needs. The zone supplies merchandise and services
for the nearby residential and business areas, and it serves local consumers from beyond the immediate
neighborhood because of its central location and its greater flexibility and multiplicity of uses. The LB
zone is less dependent upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure. While the zone serves both the
surrounding neighborhoods and the community at large, for the most part it does not seek to attract its
clientele from beyond the Town. The scale and uses of structures are intended to be compatible with the
character and density of surrounding areas.
This is a multi-functional zone whose primary goals are to protect and encourage neighborhood and
locally-oriented retail and personal service development so as to meet the frequent recurring needs of
nearby residents and businesses, to provide comparison goods and services, and to meet needs for a
broader variety of business and community services.
The LB zone is designed also to provide for diversity of housing opportunities. (3/21/2000)
(B) Parking
Subject to (C) below, underground parking may be permitted by Special Permit provided that parking
spaces required for Use Group 1 uses are surface spaces on the same level as street-level businesses
and are not permitted within the required front yard unless screened as provided for below. In considering
approval of underground parking, the Commission shall consider the character of the area including
§6-104 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-104
9-24
existing uses, buildings and open spaces; the relationship of the proposal in all its aspects, including bulk
and mass, to the existing character and purposes of the business district; and the convenience to
shoppers.
Notwithstanding other provisions of these regulations, no above-grade parking structures shall be
permitted except in accordance with Special Permit procedures and standards pursuant to Sec. 6-17. In
considering the appropriateness of the parking structure the Commission shall apply, in addition, the
standards established above for underground parking; furthermore, the Commission shall find that the
unique nature of the associated principal use and site warrants such a structure, that adequate screening
from streets and adjoining properties can be provided by topography, landscaping or other means, and
that the standards of Sec. 6-15 have been met.
Except for below ground covered parking, parking shall not be permitted within the required front yard
unless, after application for Site Plan Approval pursuant to Sec. 6-13 to 6-16.1 inclusive of these
regulations, the Commission finds that said parking is adequately screened from all streets by virtue of
landscaping or substantial changes of topography. Where a lot fronts on more than one street, the front
yard for the purposes of this provision shall be that adjacent to the street determined by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer to be the primary street.
(C) Height Limitations.
Notwithstanding other provisions in these regulations, the height of any structure shall not exceed
thirty-five feet as measured from the grade plane. Subject to Special Permit, the elements and structures
regulated under Sec. 6-127 and uses of Use Group 3 as regulated elsewhere in these regulations may
be permitted to exceed the height established in this sub-section 6-103(C). (5/4/2005)
(D) Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
See Table, Sec. 6-205(b)
(E) Ground Floor Uses.
Except for access to and egress from upper floor permitted uses, uses on the ground floor shall be
limited to uses listed in Use Groups 1, 4, and 9, which uses shall occupy not less than 75% of the floor
area of the largest floor of the building. For the purposes of this provision, the ground floor shall be
considered a floor within 18 inches of mean curb elevation; if no floor occurs within this elevation, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall determine which floor of the building shall be treated as the ground
floor. Exceptions to ground floor use regulations are noted in (G) below. (4/4/87)
(F) Upper Floor Uses.
Uses permitted above the second floor shall be uses other than Use Groups 1, 2a, 4 or 9, but may
include storage incidental to first and second floor uses.
(G) Permitted Uses. (3/21/2000)
Subject to (E) and (F) above the following uses are permitted:
Use Group 1
Use Group 2a, except that any such use in the LB Zone shall be permitted only above floors having
uses of Use Groups 1, 3, 4, or 9, which uses must occupy not less than 75% of the floor area of the
largest floor of the building.

Sec. 6-104.1 USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CGB ZONE (9/15/86)
(A) Purposes.
In addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the Central Greenwich Business Zone
is to provide for a greater variety of Town-oriented retail, service, business, community and residential
needs. The CGB zone is a mixed-use moderate density transition zone within Central Business District
separating the high intensity commercial uses of the Towns prime retail and business area (the CGBR
zone) from the medium density residential and business zones that ring the Central Business District.
The CGB zone is characterized by diversity, including small office uses, residential uses, public uses,
and a wide variety of businesses offering goods and services to suit the broad, long-term needs of
customers and residents. The area encompassed by the zone also includes significant historic buildings
and streetscapes, important resources which foster a sense of history and preserve the Towns
architectural and cultural heritage. The zone serves a town-wide market, attracting people from
outlying sections as well as from close-in more densely developed neighborhoods, and is less dependent
upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure.
It is an additional goal of CGB zone to provide increased housing opportunities in view of the
transitional nature of the area.
(B) Permitted Uses.
Use Group 1
Use Group 2a
Use Group 3

regulations, the Commission finds that said parking is adequately screened from all streets by virtue of
landscaping or substantial changes of topography. Where a lot fronts on more than one street, the front
yard for the purposes of this provision shall be that adjacent to the street determined by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer to be the primary street.
(D) There shall be no display of merchandise or the placement of equipment used for an on-site
business activity permitted in the required front yard or in the required parking area. (5/4/2005)

Sec. 6-107. USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WATERFRONT BUSINESS
ZONE.
(a) Statement of Policy and Purposes (5/11/87) (1/30/2019)
Waterfront properties in the Town of Greenwich are an extraordinary and limited resource. It is
therefore the policy of the Planning and Zoning Commission to control the uses and intensity of
development in the Waterfront Business Zone so as to enhance the value of waterfront land for the
intended purpose of retaining and encouraging commercial uses which depend on a waterfront location
and encourage land uses that maximize opportunities for public access, while protecting natural
resources. To that end, the waterfront shall be developed following the schedule of priorities herein:
i. The first priority of this zone is to protect and nurture existing and potential waterdependent
uses;
ii. The second priority is to encourage other water related uses so long as they do not
interfere with water-dependent uses, either directly by displacement or indirectly by
placing incompatible demands on the zones infrastructure;
iii. Water enhanced uses are encouraged provided that they do not interfere with and are not
incompatible with first and second priority uses and meet the special requirements of
Section 6-107(e). (5/11/87) (1/30/2019)
The purpose of these zoning regulations is to regulate the type and size of development in business
zoned waterfront properties in order to: (5/11/87)
(1) Implement the goals of the Connecticut Coastal Area Management Act and Sec. 6-111 of the
Building Zone Regulations  The Coastal Overlay Zone; (5/11/87)
(2) Preserve scenic vistas by permitting development of a height and mass which will be
compatible with the public enjoyment of waterfront views; (5/11/87)
(3) To give high priority and preference to uses and facilities which are dependent upon proximity
to the water or the shorelands immediately adjacent to marine and tidal waters; (5/11/87)
(4) To capitalize on the waterfronts unique attributes as a recreational resource accessible either
through publicly owned land or commercial water dependent establishments; and to assure
that these limited waterfront areas are reserved for the uses they are uniquely suited for and
are not pre-empted by uses which can be more appropriately located elsewhere. (5/11/87)
(5) Create and enhance public access to and enjoyment of the water. (1/30/2019)
(b) Permitted Uses:
Use Group 7a
Use Group 7b (special permit required)
Use Group 7c (special permit required)
§6-107 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-107
9-28
(c) Special Requirements:
(1) No change in use from one Use Group 7b or 7c use to another use from that category shall
not be permitted without a special permit approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(5/11/87) (1/30/2019)
(2) No new construction for any use or uses which would result in a structure or group of
structures which individually or together would total in excess of 40,000 cubic feet in volume
above established grade shall be permitted except when authorized by special permit by the
Commission pursuant to Sec. 6-17 of these regulations. (5/11/87)
(3) All applications in the WB Zone shall be reviewed for compliance with the Building Zone
Regulations including but not limited to Sec. 6-111, Sec. 6-15 and Sec. 6-17. (5/11/87)
(4) No construction or change of use of land or water shall adversely impact existing or potential
water-dependent activities or development opportunities. (5/11/87)
(5) In addition to the standards and requirements of Sec. 6-141(b)(1) conversion of a nonconforming
use of land or buildings to another non-conforming use, shall be permitted only
upon a finding by the Planning and Zoning Commission that, in consideration of the nature of
the waterfront property, including the land, the water immediately adjacent and the existing
structures, the purposes and requirements of the WB Zone are met. (5/11/87)
(6) No land in the WB Zone shall be divided so as to create lots without a common boundary with
the water. Any division shall be consistent with the standards and requirements in (7) below.
(5/11/87)
(7) Lot shape, size and location, the location and size of the buildings, and the arrangement of
parking and drives shall be consistent with maximum utilization of the property for the
purposes of the zone. The mix of slip space, upland storage, support facilities and parking
shall be such that it assures the viability of water-dependent uses. (5/11/87)
(8) No building shall be located less than 30 from mean high water unless the Commission finds
that the special function, use or design of the structure or its relationship to the lot makes
placement closer to the waterfront more consistent with the purposes of the zone. (5/11/87)
(9) Illuminated signs, as regulated in Sec. 6-168 shall not be visible from the water. (5/11/87)
(10) Sites shall be designed in a manner that preserves the visual quality of vistas and view sheds
from both the water and public right-of-way. See diagram 11. When assessing impacts to
vistas and view sheds, the Commission shall take into consideration the following:
(A) Presence of and locations of public access easements
(B) The size and height of buildings
(C) Locations and orientation of buildings, surface parking areas, and site landscape
features relative to the water
(D) Coastal resources within the view shed, including tidal rivers, streams and creeks,
wetlands and marshes, intertidal mudflats, beaches and dunes, bluffs and headlands,
islands, rocky shorefronts, and adjacent shoreland areas. (1/30/2019)
(d) Special Requirements for Use Group 7b uses only: (1/30/2019)
(1) A public waterfront access in accordance with 6-107(f) shall be provided on any site with a
Use Group 7b use.
(2) Prior to the approval of an application for a Special Permit, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall find that the proposed activities maximize the opportunity for public access
to and enjoyment of waterfront areas without conflicting with other Use Group 7a uses.
§6-107 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-107
9-29
(e) Special Permit Requirements for Use Group 7c uses only: (1/30/2019)
(1) Prior to the approval of an application for a Special Permit, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall find that the proposed activities are subordinate to, or provide supportive
services to, a Use Group 7a use.
(2) A Use Group 7a use and public waterfront access in accordance with 6- 107(f) shall be
provided on any site with a Use Group 7c use, subject to the following:
(A) A Use Group 7c use shall only be permitted once the waterside improvements are fully
developed with improvements that, first, support the Use Group 7a uses and,
secondarily support the Use Group 7b uses. Further, the majority of the waterside
improvement shall be in support of Use Group 7a uses, subject to the discretion of the
Commission who shall take in to consideration that some Use Group 7a uses may have
more space demand than others. For example, the space needed for the boat slips in
a marina could exceed the space needed for a commercial fishing operation.
(B) Once the upland improvements needed to satisfy Section 6- 107(e)(2)(a) have been
met, including but not limited to the structures and buildings to support the Use Group
7a and/or 7b uses, the public access walkway, and all parking requirements, the
remaining available upland parking area may be used to support a Use Group 7c use,
provided that the total building coverage of any buildings or structures occupied by a
Use Group 7c use shall be no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the gross lot area.
(3) Special conditions for public or private restaurants:
(A) Restaurants are permitted provided that full course meal food service and
consumption shall be the primary function of the restaurant, and full course meal
service shall be continued up until the hours of closing.
(B) The hours of operation for any restaurant shall be limited to within 5:00 a.m. and 11:00
p.m. each day.
(C) One boat slip per every 10 seats in a public or private restaurant shall be made
available for public docking and use of the restaurant (subject to any reciprocity rules
for private clubs). For public restaurants only, every boat slip required for the publics
use of the restaurant shall result in one less upland parking space required for the
same. For either public or private restaurants, a lesser number of boat slips may be
required as deemed appropriate by the Commission so as to ensure no Use Group 7a
or 7b use is hindered by this requirement.
(4) Special Conditions for Multi-Family Dwellings
(A) All multi-family residential developments shall have a minimum lot size of 20,000
square feet
(B) Multi-family development in a flood hazard zone (A-zone) shall provide access from
the proposed building to the street, both of which must be at an elevation equal to or
greater than the corresponding flood zone elevation. No residential uses are allowed
within FEMA-designated V-zones. All residential development must be constructed
according to FEMA standards
(C) Multi-family residential developments shall use the parking standards from Sec. 6-
155
(D) The net density for a multi-family residential development in the WB zone shall not
exceed 1 dwelling unit per 4,200 square feet of lot area.

be made available to the public at large and shall not be restricted for the sole use of
the residences.
§6-107 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-107
9-30
(f) Requirements for Public Waterfront Access (1/30/2019)
(1) The public waterfront access shall be ensured through the dedication of a permanent public
waterfront access easement or other acceptable instrument. The easement shall encompass
the area of land extending from the mean high water mark to a point at least fifteen feet inland,
subject to the discretion of the Commission.
(A) The easement shall be wide enough to accommodate a ten-footwide walkway as well
as necessary screening and fencing so as to ensure public safety and security for
upland uses. See Diagram 12.
(B) The public waterfront access easement shall connect to all public waterfront access
easements on adjacent properties. See Diagram 12.
(C) The public waterfront access easement shall extend along the entire waterfront of the
site. See Diagram 12.
(2) The Commission, in its discretion, may modify the size or layout of a public waterfront access
easement under the following conditions:
(A) If safe, unobstructed waterfront improvements cannot be reasonably built within a
fifteen-foot easement due to physical, site, or environmental conditions including but
not limited to presence of steep terrain, exposed bedrock, coastal wetlands, or utilities.
See Diagram 13.
(B) If, due to the nature of the upland use, a wider buffer is needed between the public
waterfront access and upland areas in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the public and ensure tenant security. See Diagram 13.
(C) If, due to the nature of a Use Group 7a use, a reduction or elimination of a portion of
the Public Waterfront Access is needed such as in the area of a crane-operated boat
lift.
(3) The Commission shall require the dedication of a ten foot permanent public accessway
easement that connects the public waterfront access easement to the public right-of-way.
The easement shall be wide enough to accommodate an eight-foot-wide walkway. The
Commission, in its discretion, may waive the public accessway easement requirement for a
walkway if it finds that there is another accessway within a reasonable distance. See Diagram
12. In determining whether to waive the public accessway easement requirement, the
Commission shall consider the following:
(A) Distance to other public accessways
(B) Connectivity to other public accessways and waterfront walkways
(C) Presence of and locations of dedicated public access parking spaces
(D) Sidewalk connectivity
(E) Physical, site, or environmental conditions including but not limited to presence of

the Commission. The restrictions shall include but not be limited to maintenance obligations
of the waterfront public access improvement and associated landscaping.
(5) In order to ensure public safety and tenant security, property owners shall be permitted to
establish reasonable rules that must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission,
which will govern permitted and prohibited recreational uses on their property, inclusive of all
easements, as well as reasonable time-of-day restrictions (e.g. open dawn to dusk) as
established in the Town of Greenwich Park Rules.
§6-107 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-107
9-31
(6) All public waterfront access points shall contain uniform signage indicating the area is open
to the public. Public waterfront access signage shall meet the following criteria:
(A) All Public Access signs shall abide by the design criteria as shown in the CT DEEP
Coastal Public Access Sign Catalog. These signs are available from the CT DEEP for
a nominal production fee. See Diagram 14.
(B) All signs shall be placed in an area that is clearly visible from the public right-of-way
(C) Where materials to construct the public access way differ from property to property,
signage shall be placed at the property line to indicate the continuation of the public
access.
(7) Public waterfront access signage may also include the following items:
(A) Hours of operation (e.g. dawn to dusk)
(B) Directional arrows
(C) Types of recreation permitted
(D) Prohibited activities
(8) Public Access Parking Requirement. Since many residents do not live within walking distance
to the water, public parking is necessary for maximizing the utility of public waterfront access
points.
(A) One public access parking space shall be required if the total minimum parking
requirement for a site is 30 spaces or less. Two public access parking spaces shall
be required if the total minimum parking requirement for a site is greater than 30
spaces.
(B) Each dedicated public access parking space shall be clearly signed and demarcated
as reserved for public access use

under the following conditions:
(A) The off-site parking area must have adequate entrances and exits and be on
property under the same ownership as the site, with the nearest entrance within onethousand
feet of the main entrance of the building.
(B) Employees of the buildings occupants shall be required to use such available
parking, leaving on-site parking for patron and customer use. Residential uses are
not eligible for the off-site parking allowance.
(g) Design Standards for Waterfront Public Access Improvements. (1/30/2019)
The purpose of this section is to establish design standards for public waterfront access
improvements in order to ensure that these areas are cohesive across many development sites.
(1) Waterfront improvements shall be accessible to the public and shall be located within a public
access easement.
(2) A waterfront walkway at least ten feet in width shall be provided. See Diagram 15. The
walkway:
(A) Shall extend along the entirety of the public waterfront access easement. See
Diagram 15.
§6-107 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-108
9-32
(B) Shall be constructed of high-quality materials that are cohesive with public
waterfront improvements on abutting properties so as to create a unified waterfront.
See Diagram 15.
(C) Shall provide unobstructed access to public waterfront improvements on abutting
properties. See Diagram 15.
(D) A vegetative buffer, fencing, or screening may be provided between the waterfront
walkway and upland land uses in a manner necessary to ensure public safety and
tenant security. See Diagram 15.
(E) The walkway extending to a public street or right-of-way in a manner providing safe
and convenient public access to the waterfront shall be made of the same materials
as the waterfront walkway.
(F) The walkway shall be exempt from the coverage calculation.
Sec. 6-108. USE REGULATIONS FOR BEX-50 ZONE.
(a) Statement of Purpose.
The purpose of the BEX-50 Zone is to provide an area for low density, business executive office
use in the triangle of land in northwest Greenwich which is separated from and denied access to the
remainder of the Town by Interstate 684. It is the additional purpose of this zone to encourage a campuslike
landscaped setting which is protective of open space and environmental values, and produces a
traffic impact commensurate with the capability of the road system to satisfactorily absorb it.
(b) Permitted Uses.
(1) Executive offices, subject to the standards and requirements as set forth in item (e)
below and other standards in these regulations.
(2) Horticultural and wildlife reservations and natural park areas.
(3) Cemeteries, provided that no location shall be approved any part of which is less than
five hundred (500) feet from a residence.
(c) Permitted Uses by Special Permit of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(1) Religious or educational institutions not operated for commercial profit.
(2) Public utility uses not including incidental service and storage yards.
(3) Radio or TV stations and towers. (10/17/18)
(d) Permitted Accessory Uses.
(1) Customary uses incidental to the permitted principal use.
(2) On lots developed for executive office use, lodgings for the temporary accommodations
of employees and visitors and living quarters for custodians and caretakers, provided
that such lodgings and living quarters shall be limited to no more than twenty-five (25)
persons; personal service facilities limited to the use of employees; and employee
recreation facilities.
(e) Standards and Requirements.
The specific standards and requirements set forth below shall be applicable to all
executive office uses established in the BEX-50 Zone;
(1) The executive office occupancy per lot shall be governed by the following;
(a) The minimum lot size in BEX-50 zone shall be fifty (50) acres. Subject to (b)
below executive office occupancy shall be limited in use to a maximum number
of employees (as hereinafter defined), determined by the size of such lot
measured in acres or fractions thereof, multiplied by a figure of 18 employees
per acre. Support personnel such as maintenance, security and cafeteria
personnel may be in addition to the 18 employees per acre provided the
§6-108 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-108
9-33
combined maximum number of employees does not exceed 20 employees per acre.
(4/1/91)
(b) For purposes hereof, the term Employee shall mean each individual who (i)
regularly performs work or services (including part-time and temporary work or
services) at such lot on behalf on an Occupant of such lot and (ii) is either (a)
on the payroll of an occupant of a lot or (b) for tax, liability or other reasons, is
engaged as an independent contractor or leased from a different employer
off the lot while nevertheless performing work or services at a lot which would
otherwise be undertaken by regular employees (e.g. secretaries engaged on a
regular or part-time basis through a temporary employment agency, contract
employees, etc.). Employees shall include support personnel employed by an
Occupant of a lot (such as maintenance, security, and cafeteria personnel); but
employees shall not include guests or invitees, or servicemen or repairmen
performing work or services for an Occupant of a lot. In order to prevent double
counting of individuals comprising employees, an allowance shall be made
where an individual is substituting for another individual employee who is
absent from the premises, so that such substitute shall be counted only as one
employee during the period of substitution and the employee substituted for
will not counted during the period of substitution. For the purposes of the
foregoing provision, Occupant shall mean the owner of a lot in the BEX-50
Zone, or any tenant, subtenant, licensee, concessionaire, condominium unit
owner, cooperative shareholder or other party legally entitled to use and
occupy all or a portion of such lot. (4/1/91)
(c) On or before January 31 of each year, the owner of any such lot referred to in
(a) above shall file or cause to be filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer an
affidavit certifying for each executive office occupancy as to the number of
permanent and temporary full or part-time employees including support
personnel actually occupying all buildings on such lot and that such occupancy
complies with the provisions of this section. The failure of such owner to so file
or cause to be filed any affidavit required hereunder in a timely manner shall
be deemed to be evidence of such owners non-compliance with the employee
limitation provisions of this Section 6-108(e)(1). The penalty provisions of Sec.
6-202 of the Greenwich Building Zone Regulations and Sec. 8-12 of the
Connecticut General Statutes shall be invoked for non-compliance. (4/20/91)
(d) The Planning and Zoning Commission may, at its option, require each owner
of a lot within the BEX-50 Zone to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and submit
a detailed traffic analysis and a traffic management plan for such property
which will address, but not be limited to, the following: (4/1/91)
(1) Institution of staggered work hours
(2) Institution of flex-time programs
(3) Institution of ride-sharing programs
(4) Institution of incentives to alter journey to work travel patterns
If property is held in condominium or co-operative form of ownership, the condominium owners
or cooperative shareholders shall direct their respective associations to provide a single traffic
management plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
§6-108 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-108
9-34
The purpose of the analysis and traffic management plan is to assist the Commission in its efforts
to evaluate the need to control vehicular traffic generated by the lot on the roads of the Town and to
provide recommendations to: (4/1/91)
(1) Ameliorate traffic conditions adversely affected by vehicles attributable to uses in the
BEX-50 Zone.
(2) Mitigate peak hour level of service.
(3) Minimize use of roads such as King Street which function as local access routes to
residential neighborhoods.
(4) Alleviate any other traffic problems attributable to uses in the BEX-50 zone which the
analysis may reveal to exist. (4/1/91)
Such a traffic analysis and management plan shall be required not more than once every other year,
unless otherwise required by the Commission in connection with any special permit application made
with respect to such lot, and shall be evaluated by the Town Traffic Engineer and the Planning and Zoning
Commission to assure continued effort to achieve the goals established above. (4/1/91)
(e) In order to mitigate against traffic to and from every lot covered by this Section
6-108 overburdening roads in the Town during lunch hour, each lot developed
for executive office use in the BEX-50 Zone shall contain on each such lot
cafeteria facilities reasonably sufficient to provide lunches to all day-time
employees of all users of executive office space on such lot. The cafeteria
facilities shall offer food, including hot meals, during ordinary lunch hours, which
shall consist of at least 2 consecutive hours between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.
on every business day between Monday and Friday. The cafeteria facilities shall
have seating capacity sufficient to serve lunch to all day-time employees of all
users of executive office space on such lot during the lunch hour period. It is the
intent and purpose hereof that each employee of all such users, shall be able to
purchase and eat lunch in at least one full service food facility on the lot. Vending
machines, while not prohibited, shall not satisfy the full service requirement
herein. For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms cafeteria and cafeteria
facilities shall include all food service facilities on the site, and to the extent that
more than one of the executive office users operates a cafeteria on a lot, there
shall be an aggregation of all such cafeterias to determine compliance with this
subparagraph. (4/1/91)
(f) Space in any building devoted to non-office purposes, and existing as such as
of January 1, 1991, shall not thereafter be converted to use as office space
except upon special permit application, unless such non-office space is replaced
with an equal area of space and number of dining seats to comply with (e) above,
devoted to the same non-office use within the same building. Any group of
buildings which were physically connected as of January 1, 1991 shall be
deemed a single building for the purpose of this provision. For purposes of this
provision non-office purposes shall refer solely to the following uses: cafeteria,
dining, kitchen, vehicle parking, mechanical rooms and loading dock. (4/1/91)
(2) Any construction or expansion adding in excess of 20,000 gross sq. ft. of nonresidential
floor space shall not be permitted unless a determination is made by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, acting on the advice of a qualified traffic engineer,
that the result of such construction and occupancy will not create a traffic hazard or
congestion due to the type or amount of vehicle trips, or hamper the Towns plan for
highway circulation. (4/1/91)
§6-108 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-108
9-35
(3) Parking spaces shall be provided on the lot to accommodate all employees, visitors
and guests, with at least three (3) spaces for every four (4) employees for which the
building(s) on the lot are designed, but in no case less than 3.5 spaces per 1,000
square feet of gross floor area. Where the Commission determines that all of the
required parking spaces may not be needed to serve the actual demands on a
particular lot due to the unique nature of the proposed use or structure, the
Commission may permit fewer spaces provided a suitable agreement, in form
acceptable to the Town Attorney, is prepared and filed. Such agreement shall
indicate that the property owner will improve such spaces or the portion of them
required by the Commission within six (6) months of the date that they are
determined necessary by the Commission and the property owner is notified in
writing. (4/1/91)
(4) Surface parking area shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from any lot boundary.
The exposed side or sides or any underground parking structure shall be set back
from any lot boundary at least fifty (50) feet for each level of parking so exposed.
(5) All surface parking lots and any exposed sides of partially above-ground parking
structures shall be screened for a depth of at least fifty (50) feet from any residential
zone by the planting and maintenance of closely spaced evergreen trees, shrubs or
hedges, or by fences or walls, or a combination thereof, all as approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. All other surface parking areas shall also be
suitably screened.
(6) Within each surface parking lot there shall be evenly distributed landscaped areas
with at least one (1) shade tree of not less than four (4) inches caliper, and other low
plantings, for every ten (10) parking spaces.
(7) Exterior illumination shall be provided as necessary for safety lighting of buildings,
walks, parking areas and drives, but such illumination must be directed downward,
no source of light may be visible from an neighboring street or residential property,
and all other applicable regulations shall be complied with.
(8) Interior illumination shall be limited to the extent necessary for the use of the
buildings, including servicing of buildings, and shall be controlled by design or
screening in such manner as to prevent excessive intrusion of illumination into
surrounding areas zoned for residential use.
(9) The on-site treatment of sewage generated by all present and proposed uses on the
site, and the disposal of effluent therefrom, will be designed in such a way as to avoid
a detrimental impact on surface and ground water quality. Further, the sewage
system shall be built and maintained in conformance with all applicable standards
and requirements of the Town of Greenwich and State of Connecticut. (4/1/91)
(10) There shall be an adequate and continuous potable water supply on-site to
permanently meet the needs of all existing and proposed uses on the lot in
accordance with the applicable standards and requirements of the Town of
Greenwich and the State of Connecticut. Furthermore, there shall be an adequate
supply of water available for firefighting purposes, in accordance with the
requirements of fire department. (4/1/91)
(11) Any portion of the lot having significant open space, environmental or conservation
values and which is planned and approved as a part of the proposed site
development for such purposes, shall be permanently restricted to such in a manner
satisfactory to the Town Attorney and the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Sec. 6-109 HISTORIC OVERLAY ZONE (HO)
(a) Purposes
The purpose of a Historic Overlay Zone (HO) is to encourage the restoration, preservation,
protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of buildings and structures (hereinafter called
structures) having historical or aesthetic value which represent or reflect elements of the Towns
cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history. Such preservation promotes the general
health and welfare by protecting property values, fostering a sense of history and civic pride, preserving
architectural heritage and protecting community character. This overlay zone does not imply or result in
the establishment of an historic district as detailed in Section 7-147a-1 of the General Statutes.
(b) Procedure
(1) To create an HO zone requires approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission for a zone
change. Any accompanying improvements to the property in an HO zone require a site plan and
special permit application, which may be made by the Owner of the structure and its site or by the
Planning and Zoning Commission on its own motion. All applications shall be referred to Historic
District Commission and any other consultants the Planning and Zoning Commission may choose
for evaluation and recommendations.
(2) Application to request a zone change and/or site plan and special permit shall include the following
additional materials to those noted under Section 6-14:
(A) A written Report noting the historic significance of the proposed property for rezoning and the
rationale as to why the application should be granted. The report shall include the following:
(i) A brief history of the property and structures including historical significance and/or historic
events either local and regional or persons associated with the property. A general
description of the building(s) on the property listed according to their known or estimated
ages and their associated ownership history.
(ii) Any relevant construction history including chronology of original and subsequent
alterations, any historical documentation (letters, diaries, vouchers, newspaper articles),
physical investigation as necessary to clarify which construction events are historic
(analysis of paint layers relative to construction events).
(iii) A description of the architecture including all exterior features and materials that are
character-defining and therefore significant, and which are intended for preservation in the
course of project work.
(iv) A description of the existing conditions including any damage, structural problems,
materials deterioration and a description of the proposed priority for repair/stabilization. A
description of the general and periodic maintenance proposed, recognizing that deferred
maintenance is not an option for historic resources, shall be noted in the Declaration of
Restrictions filed on the Greenwich Land Records as part of the improvement.
(v) An archeological assessment may be required depending on the nature of the property,
its site and setting.
(vi) All proposed work and the preservation objectives.
(vii) All support documentation specifically photographs.
(B) Information as to the proposed use and density of the property.
(C) Specific architectural and landscape plans showing how the building or buildings on said
property will be preserved. No Zoning Permit will be issued until the architectural and
landscape plans have been approved pursuant to Section 6-16.1 of these Regulations.
(3) In acting upon any rezoning, site plan or special permit, the Commission may take into
consideration the recommendations of any Town agencies or outside specialists with which it
consults, such as but not limited to the Historic District Commission, the Greenwich Historical
Society and the Architectural Review Committee.
§6-109 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-109
9-37
(4) Within sixty-five days after the closing of the Public Hearing, the Commission shall take action
on the application for rezoning, special permit and site plan review if the Commission finds that
Sections 6-13 through 6-17 and 6-109(c) of these Regulations are met.
(5) If the Commission finds that the standards of Section 6-109(c) of these Regulations are met but
additionally finds, after evidence duly presented by the Owner, that there would be no
reasonable use to which the property in question could be adapted under the HO Zone, it shall
deny HO zoning.
(6) No alteration of the exterior from that shown in the architectural plans or addition resulting in an
increase in floor area will be permitted unless reapplication for a special permit and site plan
review is made.
(7) A site rezoned by the Commission to HO shall continue to bear its original zone designation
with the initials HO appended to indicate the Historic Overlay Zone. All zoning regulations and
controls applying to the underlying zone shall continue to govern the HO site except as amended
by this section.
(8) The significant structures or features of the site which caused the HO designation to be granted
shall be permanently protected by a setting of suitable size, shape and treatment, as delineated
on the approved site plan.
(9) Any new construction shall be reviewed by consultants of the Commissions choosing to assure
that the design, location and size of the new structures are compatible with and protective of
the sites significant existing structures, features or natural resources, including those identified
in any Environmental Assessment if required by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(10) As a condition of a Special Permit approval, the Owner shall grant a perpetual Declaration of
Preservation Restriction pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 47-42 a-c,
enforceable by both the Historic District Commission and the Planning and Zoning of the Town
of Greenwich, which shall provide for, among other things, the right of the holder of the
restriction to perform repairs and charge the cost thereof to the Owner upon the Owners failure
to keep the exterior of the structure in good repair. A draft Declaration of Preservation
Restrictions shall be provided with any application.
(11) The Commission encourages property owners to seek designation of historic significance from
local, state or federal organizations and to display appropriate historic plaques.
(c) Standards
When considering an application for an HO Zone, for preservation, restoration, rehabilitation or
adaptive re-use, the property and its contributing structure or structures must have been existence
prior to 1940, be architecturally or historically notable, and must meet the standards of Section 6-15
and Section 6-17 of these regulations. Furthermore, in determining whether to grant an HO, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall take into consideration the public health, safety and general
welfare of the general public, and whether the applicant has met the following specific standards:
(1) The property, inclusive of structure or structures (hereafter referred to as property) must possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, and workmanship.
(A) The property must embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or represent the work of a master. It must possess high artistic values and
represent significant distinguishable components that have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history; The property may be a unique estate setting
significant to the Towns history and worthy of preservation, and/or be associated with events
that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; and/or be
associated with the lives of persons significant in our past.
(2) The property must be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that requires minimal
change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
§6-109 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-109
9-38
(3) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive
materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property
will be avoided.
(4) Each property must be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements
from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
(5) Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right must be retained
and preserved.
(6) Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of
craftsmanship that characterize a property must be preserved.
(7) Deteriorated historic features must be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in
design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
(8) Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the least destructive
means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.
(9) Archeological resources must be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed,
mitigation measures must be undertaken.
(10) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials,
features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work must be
differentiated from the old and must be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale,
and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(d) Incentives
To provide incentives to protect historic resources, the Planning and Zoning Commission may allow
the following modifications of the Building Zone Regulations, subject to a site plan and special permit
application and provided that the property is re-zoned to an HO, pursuant to the procedures noted in
Section 6-109(b):
(1) For structures on sites in the business zone, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize
any use presently permitted in any of the business zones for the entire structure and may further
authorize modifications of the maximum FAR for office use, coverage, setbacks, parking, and
screening for the underlying zone in question; said Special Permit shall not authorize any addition
to the structure which will cause the maximum FAR to be exceeded.
(2) For structures on sites in the business zone greater than 20 acres, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may authorize Use Group 2b or 2c Uses in proposed new construction provided that
the area of such 2b or 2c use shall not be greater than the floor area used for otherwise permitted
uses in the historic structure or structures on which the HO zone was based.
(3) For structures on sites in the RA-4, RA-2, RA-1, R-20, R-12, R-7 and the R-6 residential zones,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize additional dwelling units in existing buildings
or structures and/or in new construction that is complementary and secondary to the historic
structure(s), provided the total number of units shall not exceed the density determined by dividing
the total lot area by the minimum lot size for the underlying zone, and multiplying the result, by
1.50 in the RA-4, RA-2, RA-1, R-20, R-12 zones and by 1.2 in the R-7 and the R-6 residential
zones. The Commission may consider any fraction of a unit as a whole unit. The Commission
may also modify setbacks and/or green area requirements.
(A) When bonus units are proposed within the historic structures, or where bonus units would
create developments without lot division lines, the Planning and Zoning Commission, after
consultation from the Historic District Commission, shall determine neighborhood
appropriateness based on:
(i) the number and proximity of single family detached dwellings;
(ii) the visible impact on the streetscape;
§6-109 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-109
9-39
(iii) the number, character and proximity of other uses;
(iv) the amount and location of undeveloped land in the vicinity and the relationship of
proposed development to the pattern of existing open space in the area;
(v) the proximity of other zones either more or less restrictive; and
(vi) other standards provided in this article and the standards contained in Sections 6-15 and
6-17.
(4) For structures on sites in the RA-4 or RA-2 residential zone, the Planning and Zoning Commission
may authorize additional FAR up to 25% and for structures on sites in the RA-1, R-20, R-12, or
R-7 residential zones, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize additional FAR up to
15% in existing buildings or structures and/or in new construction that is complementary and
secondary to the historic structure(s);
(5) For structures on sites in residential zones not more than 1,000 feet from a business zone
boundary line, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize all uses permitted by right, or
special permit uses for the most restrictive contiguous residential zone, or Office Uses. Permitted
accessory uses are also permitted with the exception of the office of a resident professional
person (Sec. 6-95(a)(1)). Parking requirements shall be as detailed in Division 15 of the
Regulations. Parking in a front yard shall be discouraged. Height shall be the same as for the
pre-existing residential zone. No more than 60% of the site shall be occupied by building, parking
and drives. (10/17/18)
(6) For religious institutions existing as of the effective date of this amendment that are located in the
CGIO Zone, the Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize, an FAR not to exceed 1.0.
Further the Commission may authorize an increase in the number of stories, not to exceed four
(excluding basements), and a building height not to exceed 50 feet.
(7) The Commission may allow for the inclusion of the area of a privately owned road as part of lot
area. Further, the Commission may allow for the treatment as a single lot for parcels that would
be contiguous but for the separation by a privately owned road.
(e) Alterations and Additions
(1) No reconstruction, alteration, demolition, or addition shall be made to the exterior of any existing
structure nor shall any additional structure be constructed upon a site in the HO zone, unless
there shall have been received a special permit upon application thereof from the Planning and
Zoning Commission pursuant to Section 6-17 and 6-109. In issuing such special permit, the
Commission shall consider the effects of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement,
perpetuation and use of the structure(s) which cause it to meet the standards set forth in Section
6-109(c). Comments shall be obtained from the Historic District Commission prior to any action
by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(2) Minor work which is limited to a change in, addition to, or removal from the parts, elements or
materials of the exterior of a structure, shall be excepted from the Special Permit requirement
provided that a certificate of appropriateness is issued by the Historic District Commission.
(3) The requirement Section (e) shall not apply to any case where the Department of Buildings, the
Fire Department, or the Department of Health shall direct that work be done to remedy conditions
dangerous to life, health, or property. Where such condition is not of imminent danger, notice of
not less than 8 days shall be sent to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Historic District
Commission prior to directing such work.
(4) Nothing in this regulation shall be construed to prevent the interior arrangements or alterations to
the interior of a building unless the interior of a public building or the public space of a private
building is specifically described and designated as historic.
(f) Removal, Alteration, Modification or Addition Without a Special Permit.
(1) If any structure or building is removed, altered, modified or added to after the granting of a HO
zone or during the pendency of any application for HO zone before the Planning and Zoning
§6-109 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-40
Commission or if it is demolished by neglect, all zoning rights as defined below applicable to said
site shall be reduced by 50% except that this shall not apply if the Commission has thereafter
denied the HO zone for the site or if the Commission has granted Special Permit for the removal,
alteration, modification or addition and further provided that, in the case of less than total removal
of the building or structure, upon application for Special Permit pursuant to Section 6-17, the
Commission may grant zoning rights between 50% and 100% of those specified for the underlying
zone by these regulations. Zoning rights as used above shall include the following:
(A) the maximum floor area authorized.
(B) the maximum building area authorized.
(C) the maximum area covered by building, parking and drives.
Sec. 6-110. USE REGULATIONS AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DWELLING UNITS
PERMITTED IN THE BUSINESS ZONES.
(a) Purpose:
The purpose is to promote the inclusion of below-market-rate dwelling units, hereafter referred to
as moderate-income dwelling units, within private sector residential or mixed-use development in
business zones so as to increase the diversity of the Towns housing stock, in accordance with
the objectives of the 2009 Plan of Conservation and Development (POCD) and the POCD
Housing Task Force recommendations of 2011, and to mitigate the shortage of dwelling units that
can meet the housing needs particularly, but not exclusively, of those employed by the Town and
by not-for-profit and non-governmental agencies located in the Town of Greenwich that provide
essential services to the Greenwich community; the elderly; and others who are classified as
moderate-income households as defined in (b)(3) below.
(b) Definitions:
(1) Moderate-income dwelling units are those set aside for moderate-income households whose
aggregate income, including the total of all current annual income of all household members
from any source whatsoever at the time of certification (but excluding the earnings of working
minors attending school full-time), averaged for the preceding two years, does not exceed the
following multiple (listed below) of median annual Town paid wages of all full-time employees
and teachers of the Town of Greenwich during the preceding fiscal year.
(2) A household, as defined by The United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), is all the people who occupy a housing unit. A household includes the
related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children,
wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or
a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also
counted as a household.
(3) Moderate-income households are households whose aggregate income, including the total of
all current annual income of all household members from any source whatsoever at the time
of certification (but excluding the earnings of working minors attending school full-time),
averaged for the preceding two years, shall not exceed the following multiple (listed below) of
median annual Town paid wages of all full-time employees and teachers of the Town of
Greenwich during the preceding fiscal year.
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-41
1 person household 1.2
2-3 person household 1.5
4-5 person household 1.8
6 person household 1.9
(4) In calculating household income, the value of assets must be considered. If the value of
assets (not including personal property or vehicles) is $5,000 or less, then the income received
from those assets should be added to the households annual household income. If the value
of assets is greater than $5,000, the greater of the following should be added to the
household's annual income:
i. Actual income received from the assets or
ii. The actual value of the assets multiplied by the current passbook savings rate as
established by HUD.
(c) Limit on the Number of Dwelling Units Permitted in the Business Zones:
(1) Dwelling units are permitted within private-sector residential or mixed-use development in the
LB, LBR-2, CGB, CBGR, GB and GBO zones provided the units comply with Sec. 6-110(d)
and Sec. 6-205 of these zoning regulations.
(2) When any portion of one or more of the incentives offered under Section 6-110(g) is
requested, a minimum of 20% of all dwelling units on one existing lot or merged adjoining lots
shall be deed restricted as moderate-income dwelling units, subject to Section 6-110(h). The
incentives for moderate income dwelling units are applicable to properties within the LB, LBR-
2, CGB, CGBR, GB and GBO business zones. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
consider a fraction to be a whole number to meet the requirements that not less than 20% of
all units are moderate-income dwelling units.
(d) Special Requirements:
(1) For CGBR and LBR-2 zones, dwelling units shall be permitted only when above floors having
uses of Use Groups permitted in said zones other than Use Group 3.
(2) The Planning and Zoning Commission, when it deems appropriate, may require outdoor
recreation space of suitable size, shape, and location to serve the recreational needs of the
residents. Such areas may include balconies, roof terraces, lawn areas, and the like.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, floor area devoted to Use Group 3
uses (dwelling units in business zones) may not be converted to any other Use Group and
may not be used for resident professional offices unless a Special Permit and Site Plan
approvals have been granted in accordance with the standards and requirements of Sec. 6-
15 and 6-17 of these regulations.
(e) Procedure:
A development proposal including moderate-income dwelling units shall be subject to Special
Permit procedures and standards pursuant to Sec. 6-17. As part of any moderate-income housing
development pre-application process, a workshop shall be convened by the Director of Planning
and Zoning that includes the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO), Department of Public Works
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-42
Engineering, Building Official, Sewer, Highway, and other appropriate agencies/persons at which
meeting the developer whose development plans include moderate-income dwelling units shall
present and discuss a sketch plan prior to actual submission to any Town agency.
(f) Distance Requirements:
In the LB, LBR-2, CGB, CGBR, GB and GBO business zones an adequate distance shall be
maintained free of all obstructions from any wall containing a dwelling unit window required for
light or ventilation. The minimum distance in feet between buildings must meet all applicable fire
and building codes and provide for adequate light, air, and ventilation, unless the Planning and
Zoning Commission finds a greater distance more appropriate.
(g) Incentives:
To provide incentives to include moderate-income dwelling units within private-sector residential
or mixed-use development in the LB, LBR-2, CGB, CGBR, GB and GBO zones (including
alteration of, or addition to, an existing building), the Planning and Zoning Commission may allow
the following modifications of the Building Zone Regulations provided that (1) the proposed
development includes the requisite number of moderate-income dwelling units required under
Sec. 6-110(c)(2); (2) the Commission makes a finding that the purposes and requirements of Sec.
6-110 are met; and (3) the proposal complies with the standards of Sec. 6-15 and 6-17 of the
Building Zone Regulations:
(1) An increase in Floor Area Ratio to 0.9. The commercial floor area permitted in the underlying
zone may be constructed new or added to an existing building up to the allowable Floor Area
Ratio of the underlying zone, as permitted in Sec. 6-205(b), provided the remaining allowable
floor area up to 0.9 is devoted to residential;
(2) A waiver of non-residential ground floor use is permitted in the LB zone. Ground floor
residential use is permitted in the GB, GBO and CGB zones but is prohibited in the LBR-2 or
CGBR zones;
(3) For the GB, GBO, CGBR, CGB and LB business zones only, an increase by one (1) story only
over the number of stories otherwise allowed in these zones and an increase in the height of
a building up to 47½ feet; all as measured according to the requirements of the particular
underlying business zone;
(4) In the LBR-2 business zone an increase by one (1) story over the number of stories otherwise
allowed in this zone and an increase in the height of a building up to 40 feet may be permitted;
(7/19/16)
(5) A waiver of maximum coverage standards provided the scale of proposed structures is
compatible with surrounding uses and open spaces and provided sufficient landscaping,
screening, and decorative planting is provided to enhance the residential quality of the
development and to screen refuse, transformer, storage, and parking areas;
(6) A modification of requirements, if any, of the underlying zone that all parking spaces for Use
Group 1 be surface spaces on the same level as street level businesses. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may allow up to two-thirds of the required parking spaces for Use Group
1 to be located in an on-site underground parking level provided that the underground spaces
are designated for long-term parking by employees, and further provided that the Commission
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-43
finds such location of spaces will result in an enhancement of the residential quality of the
development through an increase of landscaping, screening, and decorative planting. The
total number of on-site parking spaces shall be determined in accordance with Division 15 of
the Building Zone Regulations;
(7) Where minimum side yards are required in Sec. 6-205(b), the Planning and Zoning
Commission may find lesser side yards adequate for residential uses;
(8) Such units shall have not less than one bedroom and shall contain, on average, the same
number of bedrooms as the market rate units in the development, unless the Planning and
Zoning Commission finds a different allocation of bedrooms per dwelling unit to be more
responsive to current housing needs.
(9) A waiver of the prohibition that no entrance to or exit from a business use shall be located on
any street frontage opposite a residence zone where the lot containing the business use has
frontage in a business zone along East and West Putnam Avenue. (12/8/16)
(h) Criteria and Requirements of Inclusion of Moderate-income Dwelling Units:
(1) General Requirements:
i. Moderate-income dwelling units shall be offered for sale, resale, or continuing rental
to moderate-income households as defined above; or to a Planning and Zoning
Commission-approved agency which may be a non-profit agency, a municipal
agency, or other organization, which shall offer the dwelling units to moderateincome
households as set forth herein.
ii. Such units shall be physically integrated into the design of the development in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
iii. Parking shall be provided in accordance with the standards of Sec. 6-155 for multifamily
dwellings.
iv. Moderate-income dwelling units must be owner occupied or occupied by the legal
lessee only. If there is more than one owner of a unit, both owners must occupy
the unit as their primary residence. Moderate-income dwelling units cannot be
rented or leased out or occupied by others not legally allowed or qualified by the
Town. An annual affidavit is required from the owner/renter indicating they are
residing in the unit as their primary residence. This annual affidavit should be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department or its designated agent.
(2) Priority List of eligible moderate-income households applying for moderate-income
dwelling units shall be selected on the basis of the following categories of priority:
i. Full-time Town of Greenwich Municipal and Board of Education employees and fulltime
employees of not-for-profit health, education, and human services agencies and
other not-for-profit agencies located in the Town of Greenwich that provide essential
services to the Greenwich community.
ii. Other residents of the Town of Greenwich.
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-44
iii. Other persons employed in the Town of Greenwich.
iv. All others
(3) Guidelines for maximum rent and sales price:
For moderate-income dwelling units in each housing development, a range of sales prices
and/or monthly rentals may be established, subject to the following:
i. The maximum monthly rent for one bedroom moderate-income dwelling units shall
include common charges, and may exclude utilities (gas, oil and electricity) at the
discretion of the property owner, shall not exceed 2.0% of the median annual Town
paid wages for all full-time Town of Greenwich Municipal and Board of Education
employees during the preceding fiscal year. Additional bedrooms will result in higher
maximum rent: two bedroom units will be limited to 2.5% and three bedroom units
to 3% of the median annual Town paid wages as described above. (6/20/19)
ii. The first time a moderate-income dwelling unit is sold, the maximum sales price for
a one bedroom unit to a subsequent moderate-income household shall not exceed
four times the median annual Town paid wages of all full-time Town of Greenwich
Municipal and Board of Education employees during the preceding fiscal year.
Additional bedrooms will result in higher maximum sales prices: two bedroom unit
prices will be limited to five times and three bedroom units to six times the median
annual Town paid wages as described above.
iii. In the case of a condominium ownership structure, there shall be no extra up-front
charge for minimum required facilities such as, but not limited to, parking and
recreational facilities. Each unit owner, however, shall pay his fair share of common
charges, expenses and assessments as provided in the Common Interest
Ownership Act of the State of Connecticut and as approved by the Town of
Greenwich Planning and Zoning Department. (6/20/19)
(4) Resale Restrictions:
i. For moderate-income dwelling units, the title to said property shall be restricted so
as to maintain the unit in the moderate-income category in perpetuity beginning on
the date of issue of the Certificate of Occupancy (the Restriction Period). Said
restriction shall provide that in the event of any resale of the unit by the original owner
or any successor owner, the maximum resale price shall be limited by the same
guidelines and rules indicated in 6-110(h)(3)(ii) above. (6/20/19)
ii. For rental moderate-income dwelling units, the title to said property shall be
restricted so as to maintain the rents charged for the units in the moderate-income
category in perpetuity beginning on the date of issue of the Certificate of Occupancy.
This title restriction will survive any sale of the rental project to a subsequent owner
during the Restriction Period. There shall be no limitation on the sales price of an
entire moderate-income rental project; however, if less than the entire project is sold,
any moderate-income dwelling unit(s) sold must be sold to a qualifying moderateincome
household during the Restriction Period. (6/20/19)
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-110
9-45
iii. If a moderate-income dwelling unit is subject to a Restriction Period other than in
perpetuity, twelve months prior to the end of the Restriction Period, the owner of
any moderate-income dwelling unit shall notify, by certified mail, the Town of
Greenwich Planning and Zoning Department or its designee of the impending end
of the Restriction Period. Failure by the owner of the moderate-income dwelling unit
to notify, by certified mail, the Town of Greenwich Planning and Zoning Department
or its designee twelve months prior to the end of the Restriction Period shall extend
the Restriction Period by the number of days equal to the period of failure to give
notice. (6/20/19)
iv. In the case of moderate-income dwelling units which are part of a commonly owned
building in which a moderate-income dwelling unit cannot be sold individually, then
such moderate-income dwelling unit will remain in the Restriction Period, if
applicable, until such unit can be eligible to be sold in accordance with the procedure
of Sec. 6-110. (6/20/19)
v. Each moderate-income dwelling unit shall be subject to an option to purchase (the
Purchase Option) at the maximum allowable restricted sales price or any mutually
agreed upon sales price that does not exceed the maximum sale price. The
Purchase Option shall be available to the Town of Greenwich, or its designee,
followed next by the Housing Authority of the Town of Greenwich, then followed next
by a qualified non-profit as approved by the Town. Upon receipt of a notice of the
end of the Restriction Period, if applicable, the Purchase Option shall be available to
the Town of Greenwich for 90 days. If the Town exercises the Purchase Option, it
may enter into a contract of sale. If the Town fails to exercise the Purchase Option
or declines to exercise the Purchase Option within 90 days, the Housing Authority of
the Town of Greenwich shall have 30 days to exercise the Purchase Option and
enter a contract of sale. If the Housing Authority of the Town of Greenwich fails to
exercise the Purchase Option or declines to exercise the Purchase Option within 30
days, a qualified non-profit as approved by the Town shall have 30 days to exercise
the Purchase Option and enter into a contract of sale. If the qualified non-profit fails
to exercise the Purchase Option or declines to exercise the Purchase Option within
30 days, the existing moderate-income dwelling unit owner will be free to proceed
with the sale of the moderate-income dwelling unit at the end of the Restriction
Period, if applicable. (6/20/19)
vi. A seller of a moderate-income dwelling unit that has been restricted as a moderateincome
dwelling unit for a Restricted Period who has provided the requisite notice of
an intent to sell shall have the option to proceed with a sale at fair market value
without restriction if no contract of sale has been signed in accordance with
paragraph (h)(4)v above, provided that the Town of Greenwich, or its designee, shall
examine the contract of sale to determine if the proposed sale price bears a
reasonable relationship to the moderate-income dwelling units fair market value.
The Town of Greenwich, or its designee, may rely on comparable sales or an
appraisal, and shall not approve a contract of sale where there is a determination
that the sale price does not bear a reasonable relationship to fair market value. Upon

units in accordance with Sec. 6-110. (6/20/19)
(5) Declaration of Restrictions:
The developer/owner of moderate-income dwelling units shall submit to the Planning and
Zoning Commission a Declaration of Restrictions and Lien adopted by the Town of
Greenwich, as to the ownership, use, occupancy, and resale of such moderate-income
dwelling units. This declaration of restrictions shall be binding upon such developer and
all succeeding owners of the moderate-income dwelling units and shall incorporate the
provisions of this Sec. 6-110 therein by reference hereto. Final site plan approval shall be
given by the Commission only after it has been satisfied that the Declaration of Restrictions
binds the developer and all succeeding owners of the moderate-income dwelling units and
duly restricts the ownership, use, occupancy, and resale thereof, and requires adherence
to established sales and rental guidelines and administrative procedures, all in accordance
with the provisions of this Sec. 6-110. The Commission may cause any such Declaration
of Restrictions to be reviewed by the Town Attorney. Each deed for a moderate-income
dwelling unit will indicate the restrictions on such unit and refer to the Declaration of
Restrictions and Lien, which shall be on file with the Town Clerk as part of the Towns land
records.
(6) Administration:
i. The Greenwich Planning and Zoning Department or other designated agent/agency
approved by the Town shall maintain a list of eligible moderate-income households
in accordance with the priority list set forth in (b)(3) above. Where the number of
those eligible in the same category of priority exceeds the number of available
moderate-income dwelling units, the applicant shall be selected by lottery. As the
goal of this program is to provide the greatest benefit to the largest number of eligible
people, the Town will seek, at its discretion, to match the size of an available
moderate-income dwelling unit to the most appropriately sized eligible household.
The selected moderate-income household must reside in the moderate-income
dwelling unit. Moderate-income dwelling units must be occupied by the qualified
owner(s) or legal lessee(s) only. If there is more than one qualified owner or legal
lessee, each owner or legal lessee must occupy these units as their primary
residence. These moderate-income dwelling units cannot be rented, assigned,
leased out, or occupied by others not legally allowed or approved by the Town or its
designated agency. (6/20/19)
ii. At the time of Site Plan approval for each housing development, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall approve the designation of an administrative agency to
monitor and administer guidelines for the rental, sale, or resale of moderate-income
dwelling units. Such administrative agency, which may buy the moderateincome
dwelling units for the purpose of rental or resale to moderate-income
households, may be a non-profit corporation, an agency of the Town, a Community
Housing Development Corporation pursuant to Section 8-217 of the Connecticut
§6-110 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-111
9-47
General Statutes, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation such as a Greenwich
Community Development Partnership, or other approved organization. Such agency
may maintain and submit an eligibility list to the Planning and Zoning Department or
other designated agent, but the choice of households for available moderate-income
dwelling units even if owned by the designated agency shall be in accordance with
(b)(3) above. (6/20/19)
iii. The designated agency shall establish the sale price, resale price, or annual rent of
the individual dwelling unit in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of
(h)(3) and (h)(4) above and with the approval of the
Greenwich Planning and Zoning Department or other designated organization.
There will be an Affordability Plan filed on the Greenwich Land Records indicating
the deed restrictions on the specific unit which the designated agency will enforce.
(6/20/19)
iv. The designated agency shall set up such procedures as may be necessary to
receive annual certification or other information from owners and or tenants which
confirms continuing compliance with the guidelines and requirements of this Sec. 6-
110 and which notifies it of any conversion in the form of ownership. This information
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department. (6/20/19)

for the RA-4 and RA-2 zones which are restricted to a .09 FAR, and except that in R-20
and RA-1 zones an increase of 25% of gross floor area over that allowed in the
underlying zone can be applied for. In the R-20 and RA-1 zones, floor area of residential
units may not exceed the F.A.R. of the underlying zone.
2) The maximum FAR in the GB and GBO zones shall be .75 FAR provided applicant can
demonstrate that the FAR in excess of that permitted in the underlying zone allows for
the provision of floor area for non-residential health-related or support services that are
essential elements of the CCRC.
(C) Density
The maximum number of dwelling units in residential zones shall be 10 per acre in the R-20
zone, 5 per acre in the RA-1 zone, and 1.6 per acre in the RA-2 and RA-4 zones. In the GB
and GBO business zones the maximum number of dwelling units shall be 30 per acre.
(D) Height and Stories
The maximum height of any principal building shall not exceed the maximum number of feet
and stories permitted in the underlying residential zones; for business zones the maximum
permitted height in a CCRC zone shall not exceed 3 ½ stories and 40 feet.
(E) Setbacks
The minimum yard requirements for buildings within the CCRC shall be the same as the
standard setbacks for the underlying zone, except that there shall be no setback required
along an interior zone line in the case of multiple underlying zones and except that no building
shall be located less than one hundred (100) feet from any residential street or adjacent
property within a residential zone unless the Commission finds in consideration of the
particular use and its specific location that a lesser distance will be consistent with protection
§6-114 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-114
9-56
of adjacent property from adverse impacts. To compensate for any modification of a
structures setback from residential streets or adjacent property within a residential zone, the
Commission may require landscaping and buffer strips of sufficient height and depth to screen
the structures and mitigate visual impacts on adjoining properties.
(F) Coverage
In the R-20 and RA-1 zones the building coverage of all buildings in a CCRC zone shall not
exceed 20% of the lot area, and the total area devoted to surface parking, buildings, and
drives shall not exceed 40% of the lot area. In the RA-2 and RA-4 zones the building coverage
of all buildings in a CCRC zone shall not exceed 10% of the lot area and the total area devoted
to surface parking, buildings and drives shall not exceed 20% of the lot area. In business
zones the Commission may waive maximum building coverage standards for structures to
provide ancillary and support services, but the total area devoted to surface parking, buildings
and drives shall not exceed 60%.
(G) Nursing Home Beds
The CCRCs nursing home shall contain at least one (1) bed but not more than 3 beds for
every five (5) dwelling units.

at the discretion of the Commission, to accommodate the passenger cars of the staff
members, visitors and guests, and medical and other service providers.
(I) Open Space
In Residential zones, buildings shall be clustered to ensure that 20% of the lot is one
contiguous parcel having meaningful shape, character, and location to provide useable active
or passive recreation areas for the benefit and enjoyment of residents.
(J) Age Requirements
Each resident of a dwelling unit within the CCRC shall be a person sixty-two (62) years of age
or older. The simultaneous occupancy of a dwelling unit by a person administering personal
or medical care to the qualified residents of the unit also is permitted.
(K) Permitted Uses
1) A Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) which includes living quarters with
or without kitchens, single family, two family or multi-family structures are permitted. A
nursing home in a CCRC is considered an ancillary use in support of the congregate
residential community.
2) Accessory uses and buildings which shall be for the exclusive use of residents and their
guests and are clearly incidental and subordinate to the CCRC. Accessory uses and
buildings may include but are not limited to health and other service facilities; food
services; garages; social, religious and recreational facilities; administrative offices;
maintenance buildings; guard houses; limited convenience stores. The size and height
of Accessory structures shall be in conformance with Sec. 6-95 and Division 12 of the
Building Zone Regulations except that in a CCRC located in a residential zone an
accessory structure shall be subject to the setback requirements of Section (E) above.

Commission to provide adequate screening and buffer areas along adjoining residential
properties and streets.
(4) The applicant for the CCRC shall submit to the P & Z Commission for review and approval a
perpetual Declaration of Restrictions as to the ownership, use and occupancy of the CCRC. The
Declaration of Restrictions shall be binding upon the applicant and succeeding owners of the CCRC
including dwelling unit owners, the Unit Owners Association and the owner of the nursing home.
The Declaration of Restrictions shall incorporate the provisions of these regulations and the
provisions of such other and further governmental regulations and laws including but not limited to
State and Federal laws and regulations governing Continuing Care Communities that are applicable
to the ownership, use, operation and management of the CCRC. The Declaration of Restrictions
shall be enforceable by the Town by appropriate action in court for damages or equitable relief. The
Declaration of Restrictions shall bind the applicant and all succeeding unit and association owners
of the land and improvements comprising the CCRC and to duly restrict the ownership, use,
operation and management of the CCRC, including the nursing home, to strict compliance with
these regulations and such other and further governmental regulations and laws that are applicable
thereto. Since a specific purpose of these regulations is to provide for and accommodate health
care needs of persons sixty-two (62) years of age or older, the Declarations of Restrictions shall
contain specific provisions which provide each resident of a CCRC Dwelling unit with the continued
right to have his or her long-term health care needs met within the CCRC, including the right of
priority admission to the nursing home within the CCRC. The Declaration of Restrictions also shall

of the septic system, all in accordance with the standards of the Department of Health. The on-site
treatment of sewage generated by all present and proposed uses on the site, and the disposal of
effluent therefrom, will be designed in such a way as to avoid a detrimental impact on surface and
ground water quality. Further, the sewerage system shall be built and maintained in conformance
with all applicable standards and requirements of the Town of Greenwich and the State of
Connecticut.
(7) For any CCRC site served by well water there shall be an adequate and continuous potable water
supply of good yield and quality on-site to permanently meet the needs of all existing and proposed
uses on the lot in accordance with the applicable standards and requirements of the Town of
Greenwich and the State of Connecticut. Furthermore, there shall be an adequate supply of water
available for firefighting purposes, in accordance with the requirements of the fire department.

uses as stated in these Regulations. It is the purpose of this section to: (6/18/2010, 7/4/2013)
(1) Promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas.
(2) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water
or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights
or velocities.
(3) Require that uses and structures vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(4) Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
(5) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or
flood damage.
(6) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

09001C0492F, 0900lCO501F, 09001C0503F, and 0900IC0504F), and other special
flood hazard areas as defined in Sections (c)4 and (c)36, and other supporting data
applicable to the Town of Greenwich, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally
adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive
until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area
of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A, AE, and VE,
including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Zone VE is also identified as a
Coastal High Hazard Area. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the
base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only
approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in
the FIS for a specific location. The determination of areas of special flood hazard shall
be based on the flood elevations shown on the FIRM and published in the FIS in
conjunction with an up-to-date and accurate topographical survey of the site prepared
by a Connecticut Licensed Land Surveyor. Areas of special flood hazard shall also
include areas where the land surface elevation is lower than the base flood elevations
as shown in the FIS, and the area is not protected from flooding by a natural or manmade
feature. In no case shall the regulated area be closer to the source of flooding
than that shown on the FEMA maps without revising or amending the maps in
accordance with FEMA procedures. (6/18/2010, 4/24/13)
(3) Establishment of a floodplain development permit. A development permit shall be
required by the ZEO and/or Planning and Zoning in conformance with the provisions of
this section prior to the commencement of any development activities.
(4) No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable
regulations.
(5) This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another conflict or
overlap, which imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(6) In the interpretation and application of this regulation all provisions shall be:
a) Considered as minimum requirements,
b) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and
c) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any powers granted to the Town.
(7) The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Longer
floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This regulation does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Town of

facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
(5) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system into flood
waters;
(6) New and replacement sanitary sewage system shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system
into flood waters;
(7) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding of a frequency determined by the State
and Local Department of Health.
(8) In any portion of a watercourse which is altered or relocated the flood carrying capacity
shall be maintained;
(9) Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes including those located outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-19
subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial
damage as a result of a flood, (including recreational vehicles placed on a site for 180
consecutive days or longer) to be placed or substantially improved shall be: (6/18/2010)
(A) Elevated so that the lowest floor is one foot above the base flood elevation, in
accordance with this regulation. (6/18/2010)
(B) Placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which
the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist floatation, lateral movement,
and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include, but is not
limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
(C) Installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Elevation
construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than 10 feet
apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six feet above ground

standard of Sec. 6-139.1 (f) (1)-(8) and the elevation and anchoring requirement
of Sec. 6-139.1 (f) (9) (A)(D). A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it
is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(6/18/2010)
(10) Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and/or Flooding: The
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, including
data developed pursuant to [Sec. (g) (4)] of this regulation, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on
Greenwichs FIRM meet the standards in [Sec. (f) (11)].
(A) In A Zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a
floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood
elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all
anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed
development.
(B) Should data be requested and/or provided, the Town shall adopt a regulatory
floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the
waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than
one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse.
(11) Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazard A and AE where base flood
elevation data has been provided the following provision shall apply: (6/18/2010)
(A) Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at
least to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
(B) Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of
any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure located in A and AE Zones
§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-20
shall have the lowest floor including basement, elevated at least to one (1) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation. (6/18/2010)
(C) Non-Residential Structures located in all A and AE Zones may be flood-proofed in
lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural
components having the capability or resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
review and/or development structural design specifications and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods or construction are in
accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this
sub-section. Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
as set forth in [Sec. (e) (3) (F)]. (6/18/2010)
(D) Fully Enclosed Areas Below Base Flood Elevation. New construction or
substantial improvements of Non-Residential buildings not flood proofed per
Section (f) (11) (c) and all Residential Buildings that include fully enclosed areas
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall
be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect and meet the following minimum criteria:
(2/9/2000)
(i) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.
Openings shall be on at least two sides of the enclosed area; alternatively,
an International Code Council Evaluation Service, (ICC-ES) certification
must be submitted to document that the design of the openings will allow for
the automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls,
providing the equivalency of 1 square inch per 1 square foot of enclosed
area. The specific provisions that are addressed in the certification must
include:
a. A statement certifying that the openings are designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood loads on exterior walls by allowing the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with the
Engineered openings, design requirements below;
b. Description of the range of flood characteristics tested or computed for
which the certification is valid, such as rates of rise and fall of
floodwaters; and
c. Description of the installation requirements or limitations that, if not
followed, will void the certification. (7/2/2014)
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be located at, or no higher than one foot
above, the exterior or interior grade immediately below the opening,
whichever is higher. (6/17/2014)
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings
or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions. Non-supporting breakaway wall, lattice work on mesh screening
may be allowed below the base flood elevation provided it is not part of the
structural support of the building and is designed so as to breakaway, under
abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural
§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-21
integrity of the building on which it is to be used and provided the following
design specifications are met:
Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not be less than 10 nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
? If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would
result from water load less than that which would occur during the base
flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or
other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components during the base flood
event. Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this
determination shall each have one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence
interval). (6/17/14)
(iv) Mechanical equipment including but not limited to electrical and plumbing
equipment, HVAC ducts, generators, and air conditioning units must be
located one foot above the base flood elevation and all utility connections
below the BFE such as into sewer lines or underground electrical conduits
must be floodproofed both indoors and outdoors. Duct systems and other
service equipment is permitted below the elevation provided that they are
designed and installed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components and to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
stresses, including the effects of buoyancy, during the occurrence of flooding
to the design flood elevation. (6/18/2010, 6/17/2014)
(v) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for the
parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
(E) Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Sec. (d)
(2) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential
projectiles and have erosion potential, no encroachments including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted
unless certification (with supporting technical data), by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that encroachments
shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the
base flood discharge. (6/18/2010)
(F) Work within a Special Flood Hazard Area, but outside the floodway must not result
in an increase in the Base Flood Elevation of more than 0.1 foot.
(12) Coastal High Hazard Areas (VE Zone). Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in Sec. (d) (2) are areas designated as Coastal High Hazard Areas (Zone
VE). Since these areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters,
including hurricane wave wash, the following provisions shall apply: (6/18/2010)
(A) All new construction or substantial improvement shall be located landward of the
reach of the mean high tide;
(B) All new construction or substantial improvement shall be elevated so that the
bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns)
is located no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation level, with all
§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-22
space below the lowest supporting member so as not to impede the flow of water;
Mechanical equipment including but not limited to electrical and plumbing
equipment, HVAC ducts, generators, and air conditioning units must be located
one foot above the base flood elevation and all utility connections below the BFE
such as into sewer lines or underground electrical conduits must be floodproofed
both indoors and outdoors; Duct systems and other service equipment is permitted
below the elevation provided that they are designed and installed to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components and to resist hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and stresses, including the effects of buoyancy, during the
occurrence of flooding to the design flood elevation. (6/18/2010, 6/17/2014)
(C) All new construction or substantial improvement shall be securely anchored on
pilings or columns.
(D) All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist
floatation collapse and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support
system shall be designed with wind and water loading values which equal or
exceed the 100 year mean recurrence interval (one percent annual chance floods
and winds);
(E) A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop
structural design specifications and plans for construction and shall certify that the
design specifications and methods of construction are in accordance with
acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions contained in Sec. (f)
(12) (B) - (f) (12) (D) of this section;
(F) There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used
around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the
fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of
obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave
deflection.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall approve design plans for
landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an
engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following
factors have been fully considered.
(i) Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive
natural compaction;
(ii) Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent
properties; and
(iii) Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
(G) There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood
damage;
(H) Non-supporting breakaway wall, lattice work or mesh screening may be allowed
below the base flood elevation provided it is not part of the structural support of the
building and is designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave
action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which it is to be
used and provided the following design specifications are met.
(i) Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not be less than 10 nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
(ii) If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would result from a
water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and
the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall
§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-23
not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to
the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading
values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent (1%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year recurrence
interval).
(J) Prior to construction, plans for any structures that will have breakaway walls, lattice
work or screening must be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for
approval.
(K) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor except with breakaway walls, lattice work
or screening as provided for in [Sec. (f) (12) (H) - (f) (12) (I)].
(L) The placement of manufactured homes or recreational vehicles is prohibited.
(g) Standards for Subdivision Proposals:
In all special flood hazard areas the following requirements shall apply:
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(3) All subdivision proposals shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals and other
proposed development which are five acres or fifty lots, whichever occurs first, and are
located in Zone A.
(h) Variance Procedures:
(1) The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals as established by these regulations shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
section of the regulations.
(2) The Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged this is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer in the enforcement or administration of this regulation.
(3) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals or
any person owning land which abuts or is within a radius of (100) one hundred feet of
the land in question may appeal within 15 days after such decision to the State of
Connecticut Superior Court as provided in Section 8-8 of the General Statutes.
(4) Specific Situation Variances:
(A) Buildings on Historic Register. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction,
rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places on the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures
set forth in the remainder of this section, except for [Sec. (h) (6) (A-D)] and provided
the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the
structure losing its historical character.
(B) Pre-existing, Small Lot Location. Variances may be issued for new construction

§6-139.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-139.1
10-24
(C) Functionally Dependent Uses. Variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damage, creates no additional threat to
public safety and meets the requirements of [Sec. (h) (6) (A-D)].
(D) Floodway Prohibition. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during discharge would result.
(5) Consideration for Variances. In passing upon such applications the Planning and
Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this regulation; and
(A) The danger that materials may be swept into other lands to the injury of others;
(B) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(C) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(D) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

Facilities and Sites replaced former Sec. 6-140.1 Satellite Earth Stations (SES) 12/19/2001)
1. Statement of Purpose: In accord with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, this section of
the regulations is intended to accommodate the needs of residents, businesses and the general
public, while protecting the public safety and general welfare of the Town, and minimizing any
adverse visual and operational effects of towers or wireless communication facilities through careful
analysis, design, siting and screening. The Planning and Zoning Commission recognizes that it is
in the public interest to permit the siting of wireless communication towers and antennas within
the Towns boundaries. This regulation establishes standards and requirements for
telecommunication facilities and sites.
These regulations are also meant to meet the spirit and intent of Sec. 16-50 L (e) of the CGS for
projects that are subject to the approval of the Connecticut State Siting Council by which
municipalities are afforded the right of pre-filed technical information and consultation with
applicants for telecommunication towers and facilities 60 days before an application is filed with the
Connecticut State Siting Council. The purposes are to regulate placement of antennas, towers,
and other related facilities in a manner that will protect the town's visual quality; and safeguard the
community by having the following objectives:
OBJECTIVES:
- to obtain information necessary to evaluate a proposed facility;
- to minimize locations in residential zones, seek locations in business zones;
- to limit the number and/or height of telecommunication towers throughout the community,
especially by requiring multiple-user sharing of telecommunication facilities wherever possible
(co-location);
- to establish locations least disruptive to the public safety and welfare of the Town of Greenwich
and are consistent with the Town Plan of Conservation and Development;
- to minimize the number of towers needed to serve the community both now and in the future by
maximizing the use of existing and approved suitable facilities (including existing towers, buildings
and other facilities) to accommodate new wireless telecommunications antennas;
- to minimize adverse visual effects through proper design, siting and screening in keeping with the
Towns character;
- to minimize negative effect on adjoining property values;
- to protect scenic roads and historic resources as identified in the Town Plan of Conservation and
Development from encroachment by inappropriate structures;
- to avoid injury and potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through high
structural standards of engineering and careful siting of tower structures and setback
requirements;
§6-140.1 GREENWICH MUNICIPAL CODE §6-140.1
10-27
- to enhance the ability of providers of telecommunication services to provide such services to the
community effectively and efficiently;
- to provide for the orderly removal of antennas and towers;
- to assure that these regulations are consistent with federal law, specifically the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 by making sure the regulations:
(a) Do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting Personal Wireless Service as defined in
the Telecommunication Act of 1996.
(b) Are not intended to be used to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally
equivalent services.
(c) Do not regulate Personal Wireless Services on the basis of the environmental effects of
radio frequency emission, as long as the regulated services and facilities comply with the
FCCs regulations concerning such emissions.
2. Definitions: When used in this section, the following words or phrases shall have the meaning defined
below:
Adequate Capacity: Capacity is considered to be "adequate" if the Grade of Service (GOS) is p.01 or
better for median traffic levels offered during the typical busy hour, as assessed by direct measurement
of the Personal Wireless Service Facility in question. The GOS shall be determined by the use of standard
Erlang B Calculations. As call blocking may occur in either the landline or radio portions of a wireless
network, Adequate Capacity for this regulation shall apply only to the capacity of the radio components.
Where Adequate Capacity must be determined prior to the installation of the Personal Wireless Services
Facility in question, Adequate Capacity shall be determined on the basis of the busiest hour of the
surrounding existing cell sites.
Adequate Coverage: Coverage is considered to be "adequate" within that area surrounding a Base
Station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmittal signal is greater than or
equal to - 85dbm for at least 95% of the intended coverage area. It is acceptable for there to be "holes"
within the area of Adequate Coverage where the signal is less than -85dbm, as long as the signal regains
its strength to greater than or equal to -85dbm farther away from the Base Station within the cell. For the
limited purpose of determining whether the use of a Repeater is necessary or desirable, there shall be
deemed not to be Adequate Coverage within said holes. The outer boundary of the area of Adequate
Coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain a strength of greater than or
equal to -85dbm.
Alternative Tower Structure: Includes such things as man-made trees, clock towers, flag poles, bell
steeples and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of
antennas or towers.
Antenna: A device used to collect, transmit and/or receive electromagnetic telecommunication or radio
signals. Examples include panels, satellite dish antennas, parabolic (microwave) dishes and single pole
devices.
Base Station: the primary sending and receiving site in a wireless telecommunication network.

which is 1 watt.
Elevation: The elevation at grade or ground level shall be given in Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). The
height of a wireless service facility shall be given in Above Ground Level (AGL). AGL is a measurement
of height from the natural grade of a site to the highest point of a structure. The maximum elevation of
the wireless service facility is AGL plus AMSL.
Environmental Assessment (EA): An EA is the document required by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when a wireless communication
facility is placed in certain designated areas.

Connecticut General Statutes, any building, lot or use, lawfully existing on February 1, 1926
or on the effective date of any amendment thereafter to these Regulations, may be continued
and its non-conforming status shall be deemed lawful provided that the non-conforming use
is actual and not abandoned, and has been maintained within the same square footage, or
leasehold containing the non-conforming use as existed on February 1, 1926 or on the date
that said use conformed to these Regulations. Nothing in this section shall prevent a
diminishment of the non-conforming use. (9/8/16)
(b) A non-conforming building, lot or use, or the building in which a non-conforming use occurs,
may not be changed, altered or added to except in accordance with the following:
(1) Change
A non-conforming building, lot or use, or the building in which a non-conforming use
occurs may be changed to another non-conforming use only if after application for
Special Permit, the Commission finds that said change meets the standards of Sections
6-15 and 6-17 and also finds said changed use is not more detrimental to the
neighborhood than the existing use.

(A) A non-conforming building (other than single family or two family) may be altered
or permitted to expand provided that such alteration or addition meets the
standards for site plan review under Sec. 6-15, and further provided that such
alteration or expansion shall not increase the degree of non-conformity. The
addition of floor area which either (i) causes the floor area ratio or building
coverage permitted in the zone to be exceeded, or (ii) results in a site plan for all
uses on the site which does not provide parking in accordance with the standards
of Division 15, shall be deemed to increase the degree of non-conformity and shall
not be permitted. (10/13/92)
(B) A Dwelling or an accessory building in residential zones that has one or more
legally non-conforming yards, may be added to, provided that: (10/13/92)

qualify for placement on the National Register of Historic Places in a residential
zone is substantially improved as defined in Sec. 6-5(a)(49.1), that building
must conform to current provisions of the Building Zone Regulations pertaining
to required yards, height, number of stories and floor area ratio. (7/19/2006)
iii. When a building that is non-conforming as to required yards is enlarged by an
addition(s) that complies with current required yards, such complying
addition(s) shall not be included in the calculation of substantial improvement
to the existing structure. (7/19/2006)
iv. Improvements to a non-conforming building that do not qualify as a substantial
improvement are permitted provided that there shall be no increase in the
degree of the existing non-conformity. (7/19/2006)
(3) A non-conforming lot may not be altered if the result would be to increase the degree
non-conformity.
(4) Damage, Destruction or Replacement
When a building whether conforming or non-conforming in which a non-conforming use
occurs is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy, it
may be restored and the non-conforming use continued, provided that the restored
building covers no greater area and has not greater cubic content or greater floor area
and further, provided that the new structure be substantially identical in appearance to
the one damaged or destroyed.
The Planning and Zoning Commission, subject to the granting of special permit in
accordance with Sec. 6-17, may permit a modified reconstruction, provided that the
restored building covers no greater area and has no greater cubic content and no greater
floor area.
