PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Roselle. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as supplemented through February 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Robert L. Laslie, Vice-President-Supplements, and Anne Wilson, Supplement Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Glenn F. Spachman, Village Manager and Linda McDermott, Village Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

(1)  No hearing into an alleged violation of the Roselle Liquor Control Ordinance shall be had except upon a minimum of fourteen (14) calendar days written notice, personally served, or served by certified or registered mail, upon the licensee. Should the licensee refuse or be unavailable for service, the village clerk is hereby irrevocably appointed on behalf of the licensee for purposes of receipt of such service. The written notice shall outline the basic allegations made against the licensee and specify a hearing date and time. Continuances of a hearing may be granted within the discretion of the liquor control commissioner provided that the licensee submit, at least seven (7) calendar days prior to hearing, a written request for a continuance specifying the reasons that the hearing should be continued. Any licensee charged with a violation of the Roselle Liquor Control Ordinance may, at his sole expense, be represented by an attorney of his own choosing. The violation hearing shall be recorded by an Illinois Certified Shorthand Reporter. 
(2)  Each notice of violation shall contain an "arraignment form," a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated herein as if fully set forth as appendix A. Seven (7) calendar days prior to hearing of an alleged liquor control ordinance violation, the licensee shall complete the arraignment form and file it with the village clerk. Any licensee who fails to file the form within seven (7) calendar days prior to hearing shall have a plea of not guilty entered on his behalf by the village clerk. If the licensee subsequently enters a plea of guilty, the licensee shall reimburse the village for any and all out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, shorthand reporter appearance fees, and the costs for having police officers and witnesses present to testify, resulting from the licensee's failure to timely file the arraignment form with the village clerk. 
(3)  Upon a plea of guilty, the liquor commissioner may review the licensee's record and the circumstances surrounding the offense and impose any penalties set forth in this section 3-5. The liquor control commissioner shall further have the option, upon a plea of guilty; to require a hearing in aggravation and mitigation if the liquor control commissioner determines it is necessary, based upon the number, type and frequency of violations, to determine appropriate penalties. In the case of a hearing in aggravation and mitigation the licensee and the village shall have the option of being represented by legal counsel. 
(4)  The local liquor commissioner may, in accordance with the Illinois Liquor Control Act, revoke, or suspend any license issued under the provisions of this chapter and/or levy a fine on the licensee if it is determined that the licensee has violated any provisions of this chapter. The fine imposed shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per year. The local liquor commissioner may further order additional alcohol awareness training if he determines that a pattern of violations warrants such training. Each day on which a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. In imposing a penalty, the local liquor commissioner shall take into consideration any and all factors in mitigation presented by the licensee and in aggravation presented by the village prosecutor. The local liquor commissioner shall further have the right to review any and all relevant materials contained in the liquor licensee's files that may have bearing on the penalty to be imposed. 
(5)  The local liquor commissioner shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days after such hearing, enter a written judgment order making findings of fact. A finding of not guilty shall terminate the proceeding. If a finding of guilty is entered and if it is determined that a fine should be imposed or the license should be revoked or suspended, the local liquor commissioner shall state within his judgment order the reason for such determination. All fines imposed by the local liquor commissioner shall be paid to the village clerk within fourteen (14) calendar days of their imposition. Failure to pay any fines or costs imposed within fourteen (14) calendar days of notification is a violation of this chapter and may be cause for license suspension or revocation. In the event of an appeal to the Illinois Liquor Control Commission, or in cases where an appeal was taken pursuant to the Administrative Review Act, payment shall be due within fourteen (14) calendars days after the entry of a final order affirming the determination of the local liquor commissioner. 
(6)  In addition to any fine, revocation, or suspension of any license, the local liquor commissioner may require the liquor licensee to reimburse the village for any and all out-of-pocket costs associated with a violation hearing in which there has been a finding of guilty or such lesser sum as the local liquor commissioner may allow. These costs include but are not limited to the village prosecutor's fees, certified shorthand reporter fees, the cost of preparing and mailing notices and orders, and all other miscellaneous expenses incurred by the village. 
(7)  If the local liquor commissioner has reason to believe that any continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten the welfare of the community, he may, upon issuance of a written order stating the reason for such conclusion, and without notice or hearing, order the licensed premises closed for not more than seven (7) calendar days, giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that period, except that if that licensee is also engaged in another business on the licensed premises, such order shall not be applicable to such other businesses. 
(8)  In addition to violations of this chapter, the local liquor commissioner may refuse the issuance or renewal of a liquor license, or suspend or revoke such license, without hearing, upon receiving notice from the State of Illinois of any of the following violations of the Retailers Occupation Tax Act, approved June 28, 1933, as amended: 
a.  Failure to make a required tax return; 
b.  The filing of a fraudulent return;

(c)  If after due investigation of such report, it shall appear to the board of trustees that such building, walls or structure is in such dangerous condition, notice thereof in writing shall be served upon the owner or owners of such real estate and, where applicable, upon his agent, lessee or occupant. Where, upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners of any such building shall not be ascertainable, notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name such real estate was last assessed shall constitute sufficient notice under this section. Said notice shall specify wherein such building is unsafe, defective or unlawful; and shall require such owner, agent, lessee or occupant to correct and make safe the same within fifteen (15) days or such further time as the circumstances may warrant. Upon failure so to do, the board shall order the building inspector to correct and make safe said building, wall or structure or to have the same demolished. 
(d)  Every building which shall appear to the building inspector, health officer or fire chief to be especially dangerous in case of fire, by reason of bad conditions of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay or other causes, shall be held to be an unsafe building and the building inspector, fire chief or health officer as the case may be, in addition to proceeding as provided in subsection (c), shall also affix a notice of the dangerous character of the building in a conspicuous place on the exterior wall thereof.

(f)  If the building or portion thereof found dangerous shall be devoted to any purpose requiring a license, the president may suspend the license pending the period of making repairs; and he may revoke the license in case of failure on the part of the owner or party having an interest in such unsafe building or portion thereof to make safe without delay and at their expense. 
(g)  It shall not be lawful to occupy for human habitation any building which is declared by the health officer to be unfit for such habitation by reason of defective sanitary conditions, until such conditions have been remedied and the premises approved by said health officer as fit for occupancy. 
(h)  In case the building inspector or health officer finds any building or part of a building in such condition as to endanger life, or liable to cause serious accident, and that such danger may be averted by the immediate application of precautionary measures, said officers, or either of them, shall have and exercise the power without the preliminary direction of the board of trustees, to take such precautionary measures as in his or their opinion may be necessary to render any building or part thereof safe; provided, however, the owner, lessee, occupant or agent of said building refuses or neglects to take such precautionary measures after being notified so to do by said officers or any of them. 
(i)  An itemized account of the expenses of tearing down and removing such structure or of putting the same into safe condition shall be kept by the building inspector, and shall be presented to the owner or owners of said structure, or his or their agents, or to such lessee or occupant, for payment.

Sec. 6-60. - Architectural design. 
(a)  Whereas, it is universally recognized that many neighborhoods in urban areas have deteriorated in the past by reason of poor planning and indiscriminate and unregulated building, and by the progressive erection of inferior and unsuitable buildings in such neighborhoods, and whereas such deterioration has been invariably accompanied by a drastic reduction in property values and by a deterioration in conditions of health, sanitation and safety in such neighborhoods, and for the purpose of preventing such deterioration and preserving unto the owners and residents of property within the Village of Roselle of the property values now existent and to secure the beneficial interest and purpose thereof, which are the preservation and improvement of the existing standards of public health, welfare, sanitation and safety within the Village of Roselle, the following provisions are enacted. 
(b)  All new buildings shall be of an architectural design suitable for a good suburban community. No permit shall be issued for any new building, or for an improvement to an existing building which is of such architectural design, that the same is manifestly inferior or so radically different as to impair marketability or property values of existing buildings in the same immediate vicinity. Freestanding buildings and buildings fronting on more than one street shall have the same material or architecturally harmonious materials used for all exterior walls. Buildings partially freestanding shall have the same material or architecturally harmonious materials used for exposed exterior walls and exposed portions of exterior walls. Single-family residences located adjacent to each other shall be varied in design and shape so as to avoid the appearance of being identical. These considerations shall apply to the R-1, R-2, R-2A and R-2B districts. 
(c)  The identical exterior elevation cannot be repeated oftener than every fifth building. This consideration shall apply in the R-1, R-2, R-2A and R-2B districts. 
(d)  To promote and protect property values, the use of metal siding from grade level to roof eaves shall be prohibited within the B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, ORI and M zoning districts, unless each wall section shall have a both a minimum area of fifty (50) percent and a minimum height of fifty (50) percent from grade to eave, of masonry, wooden veneers, concrete panel or other aggregate material as may be deemed acceptable by the village engineer or building inspector. 
(e)  Within the B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, ORI and M zoning districts, all wall sections shall be constructed of material decorative in appearance (face brick, sculptured block are permitted and concrete panel or other aggregate material as may be deemed acceptable by the zoning administrator). 
(f)  A variance may be granted to subsections (b) through (e) of this section 6-60 by the corporate authorities of the village to allow the use of different materials, and percentages of materials, than those required when the different materials are consistent with materials used in existing structures which will remain on a property and where such use of different materials is consistent with materials used in the neighborhood in other existing structures. When considering a request for a variance under this subsection the corporate authorities shall consider the existing character of the neighborhood and whether the neighborhood is undergoing redevelopment inconsistent with the requested variance.

    Controlled rotating interruptions of electrical service means the implementation of a plan to curtail electric service to firm load customers for a short period of time and rotating this curtailment of electric service through different areas within the electric utility's service territory in a situation where the demand has exceeded or is at significant risk of exceeding the supply of electricity available to the electric utility. The action of an electric utility to interrupt or curtail electric service to a customer participating in or taking service under an interruptible or curtailable rate is not included in this definition of a "controlled rotating interruption of electric service." 
    Emergency energy plan means the portions of the emergency load conservation procedures, which immediately precede and include the controlled rotating interruption of electrical service to firm load customers within the village. The emergency energy plan shall include the following steps: 
(1)  A request for emergency help from neighboring utilities; 
(2)  A declaration of a control area emergency; 
(3)  A public appeal for voluntary curtailment of electricity use; and, 
(4)  Implementation of the plan for controlled rotating interruptions of electrical service.

Every such electric utility company shall submit to the village administrator an emergency energy plan adopted by the company no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the plan is adopted, whichever is later. The electric utility company shall examine and update as needed its emergency energy plan at least annually. The electric utility company shall notify the foregoing public official(s) in writing of any material revisions to its plan and the rationale for said revisions within five (5) business days of the time said revisions are made. 
(b)  The emergency energy plan shall include, at a minimum, information detailing: 
(1)  Circumstances that would require the implementation of the emergency energy plan; 
(2)  Stages of the emergency energy plan; 
(3)  The approximate geographic limits of each outage area provided for in the emergency energy plan; 
(4)  The approximate number of customers within each outage area provided for in the emergency energy plan;

The village may reject the emergency energy plan if it does not contain all the information required under subsection 6-672(b), in which case the village shall notify the electric utility company in writing of said rejection and the reasons therefor. The electric utility company shall thereafter submit a complete emergency energy plan to the village no later than thirty (30) days after such notice is sent by the village. 
(b)  The Village and the electric utility shall work cooperatively to: 
(1)  Identify customers and facilities for which a controlled rotating interruption of electric service would require heightened response by village public health and safety agencies; 
(2)  Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on public health and safety; and 
(3)  Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on the duties of the village's public health and safety agencies.

(8)  The factors to be considered and the standards for issuance or denial of the certificate of appropriateness shall be those set forth in section 8.5-7(f) of this chapter. 
(d)  Criteria for issuance of certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  If the board finds that the alteration, construction, movement or demolition proposed in the application for a certificate of appropriateness will not adversely affect any significant historical, architectural or aesthetic feature of the property and is consistent with the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
(2)  In making a determination whether or not to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the board may consider among other things the following: 
a.  The effect upon all exterior architectural features including signs, fences, porches, outbuildings, landscaping, paving and other appurtenances; 
b.  The violation of the general design and arrangement; 
c.  The modification to texture, materials, patterns and colors; and 
d.  The change in height, shape, scale, and proportion. 
(3)  In making a determination whether or not to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the board shall be governed by the following standards: 
a.  Every reasonable effort should be made to provide a use for a building which will require minimum alteration to the building and its environment. 
b.  Rehabilitation work should not destroy the distinguishing quality or character of the property. The removal or alteration of any historical or architectural features should be held to the minimum. The proposed work should preserve, highlight or enhance the historic or architectural character of the building. 
c.  Deteriorated features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. In the event that replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, texture, and other visual qualities. 
d.  Some changes to buildings and environments which have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history of the building. These changes may have developed significance in their own right, and this significance should be recognized and respected. 
e.  All buildings should be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations to create an appearance inconsistent with the actual character of the building should be discouraged. 
f.  Whenever possible, additions or alterations to a building should be done in such a manner that if they were removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original would be unimpaired. 
g.  Contemporary design for additions to existing buildings should not be discouraged if such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the building and its immediate environment. 
(e)  Procedures following denial of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  If after the public hearing, an application for a certificate of appropriateness is disapproved by the board, said application will be denied for a period of not more than nine (9) months. During this period, the board and the owner or applicant or their representative shall bargain in respect to the objections raised by the board to the action proposed in the application for the certificate of appropriateness. At least two (2) weeks prior to a meeting for such bargaining, the board shall give written notice to the applicant or his representatives. Such meetings must be scheduled at reasonable times and not more frequently than is necessary for reasonable consideration of the board's objections and fair exploration of alternatives. 
At such meetings there may be consultation with private civic groups, interested private citizens and public boards or agencies in an effort to find a means of preserving the landmark. Consideration may be given to alternative use or sale of property. Consideration may be given to anything that would tend to preserve the site or structure as a landmark. 
(2)  If after the period of denial no agreement has been reached between the board and the applicant and if the applicant has reasonably explored alternatives to the proposed activity in accordance with the aforementioned procedures, then the board shall issue the certificate of appropriateness in accordance with section 8.5-7(c)(6) of this chapter. 
(3)  In granting the certificate of appropriateness, the board may prescribe any conditions it deems necessary, consistent with the granting of the certificate of appropriateness. 
(f)  Appeal of decision. If the owner or applicant wishes to appeal the decision of the board [to the village board,] he may do so. Such appeal shall be made by requesting in writing a review of the board's decision [by the board]. Such request shall be made to the village clerk by the owner or applicant within fifteen (15) days after being notified of the board's decision. Procedures before the board shall be as provided by village ordinances and by law. The board shall consider and vote on the appeal within sixty (60) days after it is received by the village clerk. Further appeal to the courts shall be provided by law.

Sec. 8.5-8. - Alternate landmark designation. 
(a)  The board may enter into an agreement with a property owner or other party in control of a parcel of property, whether the property is improved or unimproved, for the purpose of providing for the designation of such property as an official landmark in the Village of Roselle. 
(b)  Such agreement shall provide for the placing of a plaque upon such property in a manner acceptable to the board and such property owner or other party in control of such property. The nature of the plaque, the positioning of the plaque upon the property and the manner in which it is affixed to the property may be included in such agreement. 
(c)  Such agreement shall provide that the board or the property owner or other party in control of the property, with whom the agreement is made, may, at any time, upon two (2) weeks' notice to the other party, remove the plaque on such property, giving or not giving a reason therefor. If substantial demolition of a designated landmark property is anticipated, notice by the property owner or other party in control to the board for the removal of the plaque from such property shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior to such removal. In such case, notice shall include notification of the intention of such substantial demolition. Upon the removal of such plaque, such property shall no longer be an historical landmark in the Village of Roselle. In the event the owner or other party in control of the property at the time the agreement is made is not the same person or entity as the owner or other party in control of the property at the time such notice is sought to be given, such notice may be given by or given to, and such removal may be made by, the owner or the other party in control of the property, as the case may be, at the time such notice is sought to be given. 
(d)  Property designated as landmark property as of February 13, 1984, pursuant to section 8.5-5 of this Code may be discharged from landmark status in accordance with the following procedure. Written notice shall be given by the board to the owner or other party in control of such property within sixty (60) days after adoption of this section 8.5-8. Such notice shall briefly explain the far less restrictive and nonbinding nature of landmark designation under this section 8.5-8. Such notice shall advise the owner or other party in control that within sixty (60) days after the receipt of such notice the owner or other party in control may request in writing to the board that such property be discharged from landmark status under this section 8.5-8 and that upon receipt of such request by the board, such property shall be designated from landmark status. Such notice by the board shall also advise that such request by the owner or other party in control may include a request for landmark status under this section 8.5-8 and that if made such request will be granted.

Sec. 9-900. - Legislative findings and statement of policy. 
(a)  The village board finds that from time to time persons and entities host or sponsor events that require the village to provide special services beyond the services the village customarily provides on an equal basis to its citizens; and 
(b)  The village board further finds that providing special services as defined below effects the health, safety and general welfare of the village and it requires the village to reallocate its personnel, equipment and property, imposes additional costs on the village, exposes the village to additional liability, interferes with the village's normal operations and can interfere with the safe use of the village's public ways and the village's property; and 
(c)  The village board further finds that persons or entities who fail to provide the village with adequate notice of a need for special services deprive the village of the ability to plan for the allocation of its resources and therefore further jeopardize and undermine the village's ability to provide for the public health, safety and welfare; and 
(d)  The village board further finds that special services as further defined herein increase the village's operational costs; and 
(e)  The village board further finds that granting or denying a special event permit shall not be based on the content of any expression protected by the First Amendment that may occur during a special event. 
(Ord. No. 2014-3736, 4-28-14) 
Sec. 9-901. - Statement of policy. 
    It is therefore the policy of the village that any person or entity which hosts or sponsors an event that requires the village to provide special services shall pay the village's costs of providing such special services. It is also the policy of the village that the allocation of the village's resources and the setting of fees and charges for their use for special events shall be done pursuant to content neutral standards and procedures.

ARTICLE II. - OFFENSES AGAINST MORALS 

Sec. 13-23. - Obscenity. 
(a)  Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity, which is unlawful, when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he: 
(1)  Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of the obscene; or 
(2)  Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or 
(3)  Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene; or

(6)  Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene. 
(b)  Obscene defined. A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of undeveloped photographs. 
(c)  Interpretation of evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designated for or directed to such an audience. 
    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance. 
    In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
(1)  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
(2)  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
(3)  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the materials, or absence thereof; 
(4)  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
(5)  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; 
(6)  Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. 
(d)  Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three (3) copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(e)  Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under eighteen (18) years of age; 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.

(7)  This article is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement; provided that where the regulations of this article are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this article shall govern.

The master plan shall be developed so as to result in a uniformity of size, lettering style, and materials to be used at locations throughout the multi-tenant building. A master sign plan shall further contain a description of a reasonable time schedule for implementing the plan so that all other legal non-conforming signage located on or about the multi-tenant building shall be brought into conformance with the master sign plan.

3.  Predominant theme. In the absence of a filed master sign plan, the village zoning administrator shall evaluate the existing signage on a multi-tenant building to determine that building's predominant sign theme. In determining the predominant theme of existing multi-tenant building signage, the village zoning administrator shall review the shape, dimensions, lettering style, materials, and locations of existing signs in the multi-tenant building. The village zoning administrator will then identify the most common features of the existing signs to determine the predominant theme of the signage. In issuing a sign permit for a multi-tenant building without a master sign plan, the village zoning administrator shall require a proposed sign to conform to the predominant theme of the multi-tenant building.

Area of such signs shall be calculated by multiplying height times width as viewed from front elevation.

4.  Window signs of paper or similar materials shall be allowed provided that such signs are to be used to notify the public of special sales or current prices, and further provided that such signs do not take up more than fifty (50) percent of the total window area.

Sec. 17-22. - Nonconforming signs. 
    All permanent signs which are in existence at the time of passage of this article [September 25, 1995], but which do not conform to one or more provisions of this Code, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued only as provided in this Code. 
(1)  Any conforming sign rendered nonconforming by this amendment or by any subsequent amendment to the sign code may be continued in use after the effective date of such amendment, provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair and except as provided in section 17-22 herein. Therein shall be a bonus of twenty-five (25) percent of maximum size allowed if current nonconforming sign is replaced with sign that meets proposed code within two (2) years of the effective date of this article. 
Any owner of property containing a sign which was granted a variance under prior versions of the sign regulations of the village shall be allowed to display such signs in accordance with the terms of the variance granted. In the event the terms of the variance previously granted are not complied with, such signs shall become nonconforming and shall be discontinued immediately. 
(2)  Whenever a nonconforming sign has been discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months, or whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming sign, such sign shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished, and the sign hereafter shall be made to conform to all the requirements of this article as may be applicable to such sign. 
(3)  If a nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its replacement value at that time, the sign can be rebuilt or used thereafter only in compliance with the provisions of the code. In the event the damage or destruction is less than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the sign may then be restored to its original condition and the use may be continued which existed at the time of such partial destruction until the nonconforming sign is otherwise abated by the provisions of this code. In either event, restoration or repair must be stated within a period of six (6) months from the date of damage or destruction, and diligently prosecuted to completion. 
(4)  A legal nonconforming sign shall become unlawful if: 
a.  The sign is altered in any way in structure except for changeable copy, normal maintenance, changing or replacing of box sign panel inserts in conformance with subsection 17-21(4)e. of this article. 
b.  The sign is relocated except that a legal nonconforming billboard sign may be relocated only where its relocation is on the same property and where such relocation is necessary to permit development of the property and where the owner of the property agrees not to extend the lease for the billboard sign beyond the expiration date of that lease in force on the date of March 3, 1986. Any relocated billboard sign must otherwise comply with all applicable ordinances of the village and neither the owner of the property upon which the billboard sign is located nor any business operating on that property shall advertise on the billboard sign. 
c.  The complete sign is replaced, or at least fifty (50) percent of an individual business tenancy within a multitenant building is remodeled except that any sign which has been temporarily removed as a result of the official actions of a governmental entity other than the village may be reconstructed provided that such reconstruction is at the same location that the sign previously existed and only where the owner of the property on which the sign is located agrees that the sign may not remain upon the property beyond its current lease term. Should any of the foregoing conditions not be satisfied, or upon the expiration of the current lease, then such billboard sign shall become nonconforming and shall be discontinued immediately. 
d.  Maintenance and repair. Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or user of a legal nonconforming sign or owner of the property on which the legal nonconforming sign is located from the provisions of this code regarding safety, maintenance and repair of signs contained in this code; however, any repainting, cleaning and other normal maintenance or repair of the sign or sign structure shall not modify the sign structure or copy in any way which makes it more nonconforming or the sign may lose its legal nonconforming status. 
e.  The zoning administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the passage of this sign code, notify each owner of a nonconforming sign the manner in which such sign is not in compliance with this code. The zoning administrator shall further notify each owner of the nonconforming status and submit such notice to the appropriate county government for official recording.

(b)  A written petition for a variation under this section shall be filed with the zoning administrator upon such forms as may be prescribed by the zoning administrator and shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).

Sec. 18-101. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the village authorizes a permitted to undertake only certain activities in accordance with village ordinances to the extent of the village's property rights therein. The permit shall not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public ways, including, but not limited to such rights as may exist by virtue of the Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-113). 
(b)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village Code, and all other applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

Sec. 18-102. - Revised permit drawings. 
    In the event the actual size, type, material, or location of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the size, type, material, or location identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village engineer within thirty (30) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. No revised permit drawings shall be inconsistent with the village engineer's authorization or variation conditions set forth in sections 18-99(g)(1) or (4) of this article. Minor variations may be reviewed and approved by the village engineer. If the village engineer deems a variation to be major or material it shall be subject to approval or rejection by the corporate authorities of the village. If any such deviation also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for a variance in accordance with section 18-116 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall, within thirty (30) days of said denial, either remove the facility from the public way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefore.

(a)  Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying public way or constructing any facility in the public way shall secure and maintain the liability insurance policies specified by the village engineer insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village and its elected and appointed officers, elected officials, agents, contractors, and employees as additional noncontributory insureds on the policies. The utility shall provide the village with any and all information necessary to establish coverage including any definitions, limitations or endorsements related to additional insured's. The utility's insurance shall be primary, and any village policies of insurance shall be deemed noncontributory. 
(b)  Copies required. The utility shall provide certificates of insurance reflecting the requirements of this section to the village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request from the village. 
(c)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. In the event that the utility fails to obtain or produce evidence of said replacement insurance, any permits issued pursuant to this chapter shall, without any further notice, be null and void. 
(d)  Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a) or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. Self-insurance shall be primary, and any village policies of insurance shall be deemed non contributory. 
(e)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a sole consequence of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form of cash, unconditional letter of credit, or surety bond, in a form acceptable to the village. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the public way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village engineer works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village engineer estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village engineer may allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals from security fund. The village shall provide the permittee with fourteen (14) days advance written notice stating the reason for, and its intention to, exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection. Upon such notice, the village may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within said fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment of security fund. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(g)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than one hundred and five (105) days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
(d)  The village shall deny an application not meeting the requirements of this article. 
(e)  If the village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of the applicant or provider. 
The village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the village denies an application. 
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial shall require a new application, new full application fee and recommencement of the village's review period. 
The applicant shall notify the village in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the resubmitted application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application cure does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility.

All publication costs shall be borne by the applicant. Hearing of the variation application shall be set before the village board. It shall be the burden of the applicant requesting the variation to establish that the proposed variation in height: 
(1)  Is technically necessary to provide service; 
(2)  Is not merely for the convenience of the applicant; 
(3)  Is due to unique circumstances or that the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality; 
(4)  Is due to the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the proposed location which would bring a particular hardship upon the applicant if the height variation is not granted; 
(5)  Has not been the result of conditions created by the applicant; 
(6)  Will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
(7)  Will not endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed height variation. 
(b)  The variation hearing shall be heard by the village board and may be continued from time to time to allow a thorough exposition of evidence associated with the variation standards described herein. A variance when granted shall limit the height of any proposed wireless facility to the higher of: 
(1)  Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
(2)  Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.

The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
    Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
    If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the village or public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
    The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not complying with the Code of Federal Regulations cited above. The burden to establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider which shall timely deliver to the village all information necessary to determine its efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the sections of the Codes of Federal Regulations cited above. Failure to remedy the problem as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance and violation of this section subjecting the wireless provider to injunctive relief as well as fines consistent with the village's Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles, wireless support structures and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way such as planned unit development agreements, subdivision improvement agreements and annexation agreements; 
(c)  The wireless provider shall comply with spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. Non small wireless facilities which are ground mounted and which are defined in article VII, chapter 18 of this ordinance, shall comply with article VII requirements. 
(d)  The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new utility pole or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way unless it complies with the village's design standards. If a permit is denied based on a conclusion that the proposed design does not comply with this article, an applicant may appeal to the village board following the procedures and standards set forth in section 18-142 of this article. 
(e)  The wireless provider shall comply with generally applicable standards adopted by the village that are consistent with 50 ILCS 835/1 et seq. pertaining to construction and public safety in the rights-of-way and article VIII of chapter 18 of the Village Code, including, but not limited to, reasonable and nondiscriminatory wiring and cabling requirements, grounding requirements, utility pole extension requirements and signage limitations; and shall comply with reasonable nondiscriminatory requirements that are consistent with 50 ILCS 835/1 et seq. and adopted by the Village regulating the location, size, surface area and height of small wireless facilities, or the abandonment and removal of small wireless facilities. 
(f)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the utility pole or the electric supply zone of the utility pole. 
    However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the utility pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the utility pole. 
    For purposes of this subsection (f), the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(g)  For small wireless facilities installations on village traffic signals or street lighting poles, the wireless provider shall accept all maintenance responsibility of the village's traffic signal or street lighting equipment for the duration of the installation activity. The transfer of protection, operation and maintenance shall be to a qualified contractor that is prequalified by IDOT in the electrical category. All traffic signal maintenance activity shall be completed by personnel certified by IMSA as a Level II Traffic Signal Technician. Any subsequent routine maintenance and/or modification to the wireless telecommunications facility may require a maintenance transfer of the village's traffic signal or lighting equipment at the discretion of village engineer or his/her duly authorized designee. 
(h)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations of general application that concern public safety. 
(i)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards for decorative utility poles or reasonable concealment and aesthetic requirements set forth in section 18-142 of this article. 
(j)  Subject to the subsection titled permitted use, and except for facilities excluded from evaluation for effects on historic properties under 47 CFR 1.1307(a)(4), the Village requires reasonable, technically feasible and non-discriminatory design or concealment measures for historic landmarks. 
(k)  Any such design or concealment measures, including restrictions on a specific category of poles, may not have the effect of prohibiting any provider's technology. Such design and concealment measures shall not be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size restrictions of a small wireless facility. Any applicant who maintains that the design standards prohibit its technology may apply for a design standard variation and shall have the burden of providing legally competent evidence that the effect of the regulations is to prohibit that provider's technology. Variation applications and procedures shall be consistent with section 18-142 of this article. The availability of small wireless facility concealment or design technology in the general marketplace, consistent with the standards set forth in section 18-144 of this article, shall be prima facia evidence that the design and concealment measures required by this section are commercially reasonable and do not prohibit a provider's technology. The provider, however, shall have the right to refute the prima facia conclusion of reasonableness by clear and convincing evidence.

The wireless provider shall provide the village with any and all information necessary to establish coverage including any definitions, limitations or endorsements related to additional insureds. The wireless provider's insurance shall be primary, and any village policies of insurance shall be deemed non-contributory. 
(b)  Copies required. Each wireless provider shall provide certificates of insurance reflecting the requirements of this section to the village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request from the village. 
(c)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverage. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the village administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew. 
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the wireless provider shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. In the event that the wireless provider fails to obtain or produce evidence of said replacement insurance, any permits issued pursuant to this article shall, without further notice, be null and void.

A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the wireless provider is a "private self-insurer" under the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act. Self-insurance shall be primary, and any village policies of insurance shall be deemed non-contributory. 
(e)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on wireless provider's liability. The legal liability of the wireless provider to the village and any person for any matters that are the subject of insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies, self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts therefor.

A wireless provider shall notify the village no less than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any small wireless facility in the right-of-way or change in identity of the operator. The new wireless provider shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former wireless provider under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this article, with respect to the work and small wireless facilities in the right-of-way. 
(b)  Transfer of ownership. No transfer of ownership for small wireless facilities requiring a license agreement or supplement shall become effective until the purchaser enters into a license agreement with the village. 
(c)  Amended permit. A wireless provider shall request that any current permit be amended to show current ownership. If the wireless provider fails to have a new or amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if the new owner uses the small wireless facility or allows it to remain on the village's right-of-way. 
(d)  Insurance and security fund. Insurance as required herein shall be changed or replaced to reflect the name of the new wireless provider no less than thirty (30) days after a change of ownership, identity or legal status. 
(Ord. No. 2018-3980,  1, 7-23-18)

(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the village licenses a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with village ordinances to the extent of the village's property rights therein. The permit shall not create a property right or grant authority to the wireless provider to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the right-of-ways, including, but not limited to, such rights as may exist by virtue of the Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-113). 
(b)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the village does not relieve the wireless provider from complying with other requirements of the Village's Code or ordinances, and all other applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

(Ord. No. 374-72,  1-4, 1-3-72) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 374-72, did not expressly amend this Code, hence inclusion of ㎣ 1-4, herein as  22-30.2 was at the discretion of the editors. 
Sec. 22-30.3. - Connecting to extensions and improvements to the combined water and sewerage works. 
(a)  It is the policy of the village to provide waterworks and sewerage systems to residents of the village only. In the instance of residents of the village only, the services provided shall be the combined waterworks and sewage systems of the village and residents of the village shall not be able to select only water works or sewage works. In those cases where any owners of real estate, which is contiguous to the village limits, desire to make direct or indirect connections, they shall be required to make connections to the combined waterworks and sewage works of the village and as a condition of such connection shall first annex such real estate to the village in the manner required by law. If real estate is not contiguous to the village, the owners may petition the village to provide combined waterworks and sewage works, or waterworks, or sewer works only. In the instance of real estate that is not contiguous to the village the corporate authorities may reject such application or require that the owner enter into a pre-annexation agreement with the village as a pre-condition of the extension of waterworks and/or sewerage whereby such owners agree to annex any real estate to be served to the Village when such real estate becomes contiguous to the village. The terms of the pre-annexation agreements shall be within the absolute discretion of the corporate authorities of the village and may include all terms and conditions the corporate authorities deem appropriate. An owner of real estate that is not contiguous to the village who is unwilling to agree to the terms and conditions required by the village in a pre-annexation agreement shall not be entitled to the extension of waterworks and/or sewer works. 
(b)  Any owners of real estate requesting waterworks or sewer works shall pay as determined by the corporate authorities all or part of the costs of extending the water lines and/or the sewer lines from the existing location of such lines to and across the entire frontage of the real estate to be served; provided, however, the village may agree to pay a part of the costs of such installation by a recapture agreement containing such terms and provisions as may be approved by the corporate authorities. 
(c)  Any agreement providing for the payment to the village for the proportionate share of costs of the improvements, shall require adjoining property owners who ultimately benefit from the improvement to pay as required by ordinance a proportionate share of their costs thereof, either to the village or the person paying all or a part of the cost of installing the improvement. 
(d)  The property owners shall also be required to pay the then current tap-on fees and such additional costs or charges as are established by ordinance.

In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(4)  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, sump pumps, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other source of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
(5)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be inspected and approved before being concealed or backfilled. 
(6)  Any person filling in an excavation without having first received the written approval of the building inspector as provided in this chapter, shall expose the sewer for inspection at no cost to the village. In any case where the inspector finds the work on any sewer not done in a satisfactory manner as herein provided, he shall serve written notice on the person to whom the permit is issued, stating wherein such work is deficient and ordering said person to remedy such defect within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event such person fails to comply therewith, the inspector shall cause such defect to be corrected at the expense of the person to whom the permit was issued. 
    All excavations for building sewer installation shall comply with the provisions of this code relating to excavations in streets and shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village.

    The user charge system as hereinafter set forth has been developed from data outlined in the report of Pavia-Marting and Company, Consulting Engineers, Roselle, Illinois, dated August, 1985, entitled "Report on Development of a User Charge System," which report may be amended from time to time in conforming with section 22-141, and which shall constitute the basis for determining user charges. A copy of the report, as may be amended, shall be filed and maintained by the Roselle Village Clerk for public inspection during regular business hours. 
(Ord. No. 1971-90,  1, 6-25-90; Ord. No. 1980-90,  1, 7-23-90) 
Sec. 22-141. - Basis for wastewater service charges. 
    The wastewater service charges for the use of, and for the service supplied by, the wastewater facilities of the Village of Roselle shall consist of a basic user rate to pay expenses for the operation, maintenance expense, and replacement of the system, debt service charge to pay principal and interest of outstanding revenue bonds issued for sewer construction purposes, and a sewer user rate to pay for operation and maintenance of the sewer system in Cook County. 
    The basic user rate shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for the purpose of paying the cost associated with operation, maintenance and replacement of the system. The basic user rate will be applicable for wastes having the following average strength waste characteristics: 
(1)  A five-day, twenty-degree Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred (200) mg/l; 
(2)  A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred forty (240) mg/l; 
(3)  An ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) content of twenty (20) mg/l based on one hundred (100) gpcpd. 
    It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including an equipment replacement fund for the year, for all works categories. 
(2)  Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids, BOD, and ammonia-nitrogen. 
(3)  Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD, and pounds of ammonia-nitrogen to be treated. 
(4)  Compute costs per thousand gallons for average strength waste. 
(5)  Compute the unit costs per thousand gallons and per pound of BOD, SS and NH3-N based on average strength waste. 
    A surcharge in addition to the basic user charge will be levied to all users whose discharges exceed the design concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l), and 20 mg/l NH3-N. The surcharge will be based on metered sewage flow-for all wastes which exceed these concentrations. Section 26-98 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge. 
    The debt service charge on bonds not included in the operating budget of the wastewater division shall be computed by dividing the annual cost of debt service of revenue bonds outstanding applicable to the construction of sewerage system improvements by the total billable flow on a cost per thousand gallon rate. The debt service charge shall be included in a combined water and sewer capital improvement surcharge. 
    The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public accountants to the Village of Roselle in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in the billable flow and in operation and maintenance costs including equipment replacement costs. The purpose of annual review is to assure that each user through the wastewater service charge pays a proportionate share of the cost of operation and maintenance, including debt service, and to maintain proportionality of the user charge system. 
(Ord. No. 1971-90,  1, 6-25-90; Ord. No. 1980-90,  1, 7-23-90) 
Sec. 22-142. - Measure of flow. 
    The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption rounded to the lowest thousand gallons. 
(1)  If the persons or other dischargers (industrial, commercial, etc.) discharging wastes into the public sewers procure any part, or all, of their water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the discharger shall, if directed by the Village of Roselle, install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
(2)  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
(3)  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the superintendent. 
(Ord. No. 1971-90,  1, 6-25-90; Ord. No. 1980-90,  1, 7-23-90) 
Sec. 22-143. - User charges. 
    Effective for bills issued on or after May 1, 2016 basic user rates for the use of, and service supplied by, the wastewater facilities of the village within the village limits based on the amount of water consumed, as shown by the water meter shall be as follows: 
(1)  A basic user rate per thousand gallons shall be applied to all domestic water discharges based as follows: 
DuPage County Cook County $5.60/1,000 gallons $3.00/1,000 gallons *

뷫sers of the Cook County system pay for use of and for service by the MWROGC wastewater facilities through property taxes. 
(2)  All non-metered users of the wastewater facilities shall pay a minimum monthly flat rate charge adequate to cover the cost of the debt service charge and the basic user rate. The flat rate is based upon average residential monthly water consumption as follows: 
DuPage County 
$5.60/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $33.60 
Cook County 
$3.00/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $18.00 
Effective for bills issued on or after January 1, 2017: 
DuPage County 
$5.85/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $35.10

Effective for bills issued on or after January 1, 2020: 
DuPage County 
$6.25/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $37.50 
Cook County 
$3.35/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $20.10 
In the event that the use of wastewater facilities by a flat-rate user is determined by the Village to probably exceed 6,000 gallons per month, the Village may require such flat-rate user to install water metering devices on the water supply or sewer main to measure the gallons of water used. 
(3)  Users of the system who have only a sewerage system connection shall pay flat rates and charges for the capital improvement of the sewerage system in the sum of seventeen dollars and seventy cents ($17.70) per monthly billing period. ($2.95/1,000 gallons  6,000 gallons = $17.70). Effective for bills issued on or after January 1, 2017 users of the system who have only a sewerage system connection shall pay flat rates and charges for the capital improvement of the sewerage system in the sum of twenty three dollars and ten cents ($23.10) per monthly billing period.

SECTION 4.00. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

4.01. - Interpretation. 
(A)  Minimum requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare. 
(B)  Interpretation of uses listed in definitions. Nothing contained in section 3.02, definitions, shall be construed to be a listing of permitted or special uses; uses which are contained among the several definitions are not necessarily found within any of the particular sections devoted to permitted or special uses, and to the extent that such uses are defined but not found in any particular section devoted to permitted or special use, such defined use shall be expressly prohibited. 
(C)  Uses not specifically permitted in district. Except as hereinafter provided, when a use is not specifically listed in a particular section devoted to permitted or special uses, it shall be expressly prohibited. 
(D)  Interpretation of use lists. The zoning administrator may allow land uses (permitted or special) which, though not contained by name in a zoning district list of permitted or special uses, are deemed to be similar in nature and clearly compatible with the listed uses. However, such nonlisted uses shall not be approved by the zoning administrator until an application for such use has been reviewed by the plan commission and zoning board and approved by the village board of trustees. All uses which are not listed but which have been approved by the village board shall be added by ordinance to the appropriate use list at the time of periodic updating and revision of this ordinance. 
(E)  Special uses: 
(1)  To provide for the location of certain uses hereinafter specified which are deemed desirable for the public welfare within a given district or districts, but which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of the district in which they are located, a classification of special uses is hereby established. Procedures for special uses are set forth in section 13.11. 
(2)  Where a building, structure or use of land lawfully exists at a special use on the effective date of this ordinance, and is classified by this ordinance as a special use such use shall be considered a lawful special use. Any special use as above stated may be expanded to the limits of the special use ordinance as adopted. 
(3)  Where a building, structure or use of land lawfully exists as a permitted use on the effective date of this ordinance, and is classified by this ordinance as a special use, such use shall be considered a lawful special use. Any expansion or major alteration of such existing lawful special use shall require a new special use ordinance to be issued pursuant to section 13.11, special uses. 
(4)  Where a building, structure or use is not allowed as a special use or permitted use in the district in which it is zoned under this ordinance, and exists as a special use under the terms of the ordinance immediately prior to the date of the adoption of this ordinance, such building, structure or use shall be considered to be nonconforming and shall be subject to the provisions of section 5.00, nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses. 
(5)  If a special use ceases for a period of more than one year, the special use permit shall be void and the special use cannot again be started except in conformance with the provisions of section 13.11, special uses. 
(F)  Administrative relief. Although the requirements of this ordinance are written in very specific terms, reasonable flexibility is offered through such devices as amendments, appeals, variations, special uses, and special use-planned unit development. 
4.02. - Separability. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Village of Roselle that the several provisions of this ordinance are separable in accordance with the following: 
(A)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this ordinance to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provision not specifically included in said judgment. 
(B)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this ordinance to a particular property, building or other structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said provisions to any other property, building, or structure not specifically included in said judgment. 
4.03. - Other laws and agreements. 
(A)  Relationship with other laws. Where the conditions imposed by any provision herein upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision herein or any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive (or which impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern. 
(B)  Effect of existing agreements. This ordinance is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement. Where the regulations of this ordinance are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements the requirements herein shall govern. 
4.04. - Scope of regulations. 
(A)  Change in buildings, structures or uses. Except as may otherwise be provided, all buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or building established hereafter, all structural alterations or relocation of existing buildings occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing uses occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations herein which are applicable to the zoning district in which such buildings, structures, uses, or land shall be located. 
(B)  Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses. Any lawful building, structure or use existing at the time of the enactment of the zoning ordinance may be continued, even though such building, structure, or use does not conform to the provisions herein for the district in which it is located. Whenever a district shall be changed hereafter, any then existing lawful use may be continued, subject to the provisions in section 5.00. 
(C)  Unlawful building, structure or use. Any building, structure or use which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance shall become or be made lawful unless such building structure or use shall be allowable under the terms of this ordinance; and to the extent that in any manner that said unlawful building, structure, or use is in conflict with the requirements of this ordinance, said building, structure, or use remains unlawful hereunder. 
(D)  Building permits. Where a building permit for a building or structure has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and provided that construction is begun within ninety (90) days of such effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, said building or structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the building permit was issued. Further it may, upon completion, be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use for which it was originally designated, subject thereafter to the provisions of section 5.00. 
(E)  Open uses. Where a lot is to be occupied for a permitted use without buildings or structures, the side yards and front yard required for such lot shall be provided and maintained unless otherwise stipulated in this ordinance. However, side yards shall not be required on lots used for garden purposes without buildings or structures. No side or front yards shall be required on lots used for public recreation areas without buildings or structures.

4.09. - Floodplain regulations.[2] 
    This section of the Roselle Zoning Ordinance is designed to balance future development with physical environmental conditions by controlling the use of all floodplains and/or wetland areas in the Village of Roselle. 
(A)  Methodology of floodplain delineation. The floodplain shall be the high-water elevation and limits of the base flood as established by the most recent and best available data. Thedata to be used are listed below in descending order of accuracy, completeness, and currentness. When data of higher order become available, data of lower order will not be used. 
(1)  Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA)- Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) as certified by Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources (IDOT-DWR). 
(2)  IDOT-DWR Regulatory Flood Plain Maps and Profiles. 
(3)  Soil Conservation Service-Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago (SCS-MSDGC) Flood-Water Management Plans, using the "without project." 
(4)  Other detailed one hundred-year flood studies, if certified by IDOT-DWR. 
(5)  FEMA Flood Hazard Boundary Maps (FHBM) and approximate FIS data. 
(6)  USGS maps of flood-prone areas. 
(7)  USGS-NIPC Hydrologic Investigation Atlases (Floods of Records). 
When using maps under items (5) and (6) above, the regulatory high-water elevation shall be those of the flood of record. 
(B)  Purpose. The following criteria and purposes are established for the utilization and control of such floodplains and/or wetland areas: 
(1)  To consider flooding and drainage problems as space allocation or land use problems and to the degree practicable allocate the natural storage space, floodplains and wetlands, for this purpose. 
(2)  To use floodplains and wetlands for land use purposes which are compatible with their physical conditions, thereby preventing the creation of any new flood and drainage problems. 
(3)  To avoid the increase of upstream and downstream flood risks by preventing increased runoff and a redistribution of flood waters. 
(4)  To preserve and possibly enhance the quality of ground and surface water resources by helping to control excess infiltration into sanitary sewer systems and by prohibiting the location of septic systems and mixed fills in unfavorable physical environment. 
(5)  To preserve and possibly enhance the quality of groundwater supplies by maintaining open and undisturbed prime natural groundwater recharge areas. 
(6)  To preserve distinctive floodplain and wetland flora and fauna. 
(7)  To consider floodplain and wetland areas in density consideration in zoning and subdivision determinations. 
(8)  To lessen or avoid the hazards to persons and damage to property resulting from the accumulation or runoff of storm or flood waters, as essential for the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the Village of Roselle. 
(C)  Definitions. For the purpose of this ordinance, the definitions included in section 3.02, definitions, under "floodwater (stormwater) management regulations" shall apply. 
(D)  General provisions for floodplain. Mobile homes are not permitted in the special flood hazard area (SFHA). No development shall take place in channel areas (floodway) required to carry normal flow. Floodplain and/or wetland area(s) within the Village of Roselle shall not be disturbed, reshaped or otherwise affected by channel relocation, channel deepening, filling or grading of any type, or the erection of any structure (including but not limited to buildings, culverts, docks, dams or bulkheads), or the storage of any materials or equipment, except by special use permit. A special use permit will be required for normal maintenance of waterways, provided such maintenance is limited to the removal of accumulated debris and the control of vegetation which has the potential to interfere with flows in the waterways. 
(E)  Permitted uses in the floodplain. When permitted by the underlying base zoning district and upon issuance of a special use permit, the following uses shall be permitted within the floodplain and/or wetland area to the extent that they are not prohibited by any law or other provision of this ordinance: Agricultural uses without permanent buildings, such as, but not limited to, general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, floriculture, apiculture, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and wild crop harvesting; private or public recreational uses such as golf courses, tennis courts, golf driving ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking, horseback riding and bicycle riding areas; and portions of industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential uses such as natural areas, lawns, and unpaved play areas. 
(F)  Special uses in the floodplain. Special use permits shall be issued only after review and recommendation by the plan commission, public hearing and recommendation by the zoning board of appeals, and adoption of a special use ordinance by the president and board of trustees. All development in the floodplain area(s) granted a special use permit shall comply with the following provisions: 
(1)  No person, firm, or corporation shall commence any construction, substantial improvement, subdivision of land, placement of mobile homes or other development in the areas located in an "A Zone" without first obtaining a permit from the village engineer. The village engineer shall not issue such permit for construction substantial improvement, or other development that does not comply with the provisions of this ordinance or that has been denied a permit required by the federal or state law including Section 404, of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. 
(2)  Within areas designated as "A Zones," each application for development shall be accompanied by elevations, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor, including basement, and in the case of floodproof structures, the elevations to which it will be floodproofed. 
(3)  The village engineer shall require certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces, and other factors associated with the base flood. 
(4)  The application shall also contain information on certification as reasonably may be required by the village engineer in order to determine eligibility for permits or to enforce the terms of this ordinance. 
(5)  The village engineer shall review applications for permit and determine before issuing a permit that the development activity would be reasonably safe from flood damage. 
(6)  All required federal and state permits shall be obtained. 
(G)  Prevention of increased damages: 
(1)  No development in the special flood hazard area shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity. 
For development proposals located in an identified floodway or within a riverine special flood hazard area where the floodway has not yet been identified, the following rule shall apply: The village engineer shall review the development plans to discern if: 
a.  A new obstruction to flood flows would be created; 
b.  The project will involve a channel crossing such as a bridge or pipeline; or 
c.  The project will modify the shape of the channel. 
If any of these three (3) situations will result from the project, the applicant shall be required to obtain a permit from the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, issued pursuant to Illinois Revised Statutes Chapter 19, Section 70. The village engineer shall not approve issuance of a building permit unless the applicant has obtained either a Section 70 permit or a "waiver of permit required" from the Division of Water Resources. 
For development proposals located in a flood fringe, "AO Zone" or "AH Zone," identified as such on a special flood hazard area map or in a lakefront floodplain, ponding area, area of sheet flow, or other special flood hazard areas not subject to overbank flooding from an identified channel, the requirements of this subsection 4.09(G)(1) shall not apply. 
(2)  No development in the special flood hazard area shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the floodplain elevation unless such materials are stored in a storage tank or floodproofed building constructed according to the requirements of section 4.09(H), protection of buildings, of this ordinance. 
(3)  Utilities standards shall be in conformance with section 4.09(K), utility standards, of this ordinance. 
(H)  Protection of buildings. In addition to the damage prevention requirements of section 4.09(G), prevention of increased damages, all buildings to be located in the special flood hazard area shall be protected from flood damage below floodplain elevation. This building protection requirement applies to the following situations: 
(1)  Construction or placement of a new building valued at more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); 
(2)  Improvements made to an existing building that increase the first floor area by more than twenty (20) percent; 
(3)  Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are valued at or more than fifty (50) percent of the value of the building before the damaged occurred. This building protection requirement may be met by any one of the following methods: 
(1)  A building may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following:

Editor's note- It should be noted that Ord. No. 2013-3694, adopted August 26, 2013, adopted various provisions of the DuPage County, Countywide Stormwater and Flood Plain Ordinance. Further, Section 3 of Ord. No. 2013-3694 states that: "In order to assure that the provisions of the existing ordinances of the municipality and those which may be adopted in the future are consistent with, and at least as stringent as, the DuPage County Stormwater Management Plan and the County Ordinance, the Corporate Authorities do hereby adopt by reference the following provisions of the County Ordinance:   Articles 1-18, in their entirety   Appendices A, B, and C, in their entirety   Exhibits 1 and 2, in their entirety   Schedules A and B, in their entirety    The provisions adopted by this section shall be in full force and effect and shall supersede any other ordinances of the municipality with which they are inconsistent or which are less stringent than the terms of this Ordinance. The DuPage County Countywide Stormwater and Flood Plain Ordinance is attached hereto as Appendix A." 

4.10. - Stormwater detention.[3] 
(A)  A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all commercial-industrial developments, for all multiple-family residential developments, for all single-family developments and single-family residences. 
(B)  The release rate of stormwater from all developments requiring detention shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state. A release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of three (3) years frequency with a runoff coefficient of zero point fifteen (0.15) will be acceptable unless the applicant can show by detailed calculations which are acceptable to the village engineer that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater. 
(C)  Storm sewer systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass the flow, through the development, from all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency assuming that the land is in a fully developed state under present zoning or any proposed zoning under the comprehensive plan, adopted April 9, 1979. The bypass flow rate shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than zero point three five (0.35). An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the village and has been constructed. 
(D)  The live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of one hundred-year frequency rainfall, as published by the U.S. Weather Bureau for this area. The detention volume required shall be that necessary to temporarily store the runoff of a one hundred-year rainfall, for any and all durations, from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate. 
(E)  Where any portion of the proposed development is a floodplain as defined in section 4.09, the volume shall be added to the volume of storage computed in accordance with paragraph (D) above. 
(F)  All detention facilities located on private property shall be privately maintained by the property owner. 
(G)  Where it is not practical for the property owner to construct a retention facility on his own property he may combine his requirements with those of another property owner to construct a joint facility or he may contract with the Village of Roselle to furnish the necessary storage. The cost of the storage would be eight thousand dollars ($8,000.00) per acre foot or the actual cost of the storage facility. 
(H)  The stormwater may be stored in a pond or in a basement or other underground storage area. Roofs may not be used for storage. Preliminary stormwater storage plans, including the concept and site plan details, shall be approved by the plan [planning and zoning] commission. 
(I)  In the event the downstream sewers are inadequate to receive the release rate hereinabove provided, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream sewers and additional detention as determined by the village engineer shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers. 
(J)  Plans, specifications and calculations for stormwater detention facilities in compliance with the plans approved by the plan commission as required herein, shall be submitted to the village engineer for approval prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(K)  Stormwater management facilities: 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide uniform standards by which stormwater detention/retention facilities should be designed and constructed in a manner which is functional and aesthetically pleasing. It is the goal of the Village of Roselle to combine stormwater detention/retention ponds where practical in one large facility in lieu of numerous scattered locations. 
(2)  Detention ponds shall be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. The facility must be designed so that it is maintainable. An approved method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be provided to a positive gravity outlet. 
(3)  The combination of storage water from the one hundred-year storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of seventy-two (72) hours. Maximum depth of planned stormwater storage facilities shall not exceed four (4) feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the village. Parking lots may not be used for storage if the maximum depth is greater then six (6) inches. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be one and one-half (11/2) percent and maximum slopes shall be six (6) to one (six (6) units horizontally to one unit vertically). Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to natural land contours as practical and a six (6) to one side slope or less shall be used where possible. If slopes greater than six (6) to one are necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions, approvals shall be obtained from the village engineer and suitable erosion control provided in addition to the protection required to insure public health, safety and welfare. Pit type detention ponds with vertical side slopes are strictly prohibited. 
(4)  Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. If periodic maintenance of the proposed outlet control structure will be necessary adequate service drives must be provided at an elevation above the design high water level. Ingress/egress easements must be provided for any service drive. Each stormwater storage area shall be provided witha method of emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the one hundred-year frequency storm occurs or the outlet structure fails. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without attention. Any overflows from the emergency overflow must be directed to a natural surface channel through a drainage easement. No obstructive structures may be constructed within the overflow drainageway. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features of the outlet control structure and emergency overflow facility. 
(5)  Both the outlet control structure and emergency overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect public health, safety and welfare. Stormwater velocities shall be kept to a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outlet structure will not be permitted without complete protection for public safety. When excessive velocities greater than the maximum permissible velocity or the nonerodible velocity will occur, an approved maintainable method to stabilize the channel must be submitted to the village engineer for approval. 
(6)  A maintenance plan for each detention pond must be submitted for approval. The plan must indicate areas which require continual maintenance on a regular basis and unusual items which occur on an infrequent basis. The plan must provide for periodic inspection of all facilities on a regular basis of not less than annually or after all major storm events. The maintenance plan must be submitted along with the construction plans for the detention pond. 
(7)  Retention ponds shall be designed with all of the items required for a detention pond except that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive outlet shall be eliminated. The following additional conditions shall be complied with: 
a.  Water surface shall not exceed one-tenth ( 1/10 ) of the tributary drainage area. 
b.  Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action. This protection must be provided from a minimum of one foot above the design highwater level to one foot below the design normal water level. The method of shoreline protection must be approved by the village. The maintenance plan must address the frequency for repairing the shoreline protection system. The shoreline protection system must be inspected not less than annually. 
c.  Minimum normal water depth shall be four (4) feet. If fish life is desirable, a minimum of one-third ( 1/3 ) of the pond area shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet deep. 
d.  Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. 
e.  Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features. 
f.  Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided. Design calculation to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared and approved by the village engineer. 
g.  In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for purposes of storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the evapotranspiration demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of excess stormwater runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the one hundred-year storm runoff. 
h.  The design of retention ponds shall consider the inflow of sediment from upstream areas. A method for capturing sediment in a method and location which is maintainable shall be considered during design. The need and frequency for removing sediment shall be addressed in the maintenance plan. 
(8)  Plans, specifications and all calculations for stormwater runoff control as required hereunder shall be submitted to the village engineer for review and approval prior to the approval of a final plat, in the case of subdivisions and planned unit developments, or issuance of a building permit, in the case of commercial or industrial construction. 
(9)  Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for stormwater runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or drainage construction on the project site. 
(10)  The construction of the stormwater control system shall be accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage capacity can be increased to provide benefit to the village negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible. 
(11)  The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the stormwater runoff control system shall give consideration to providing groundwater recharge to compensate for the reduction in percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and roofed over. Specific design calculations and details shall be provided with the final plans and specifications presented for village review. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of existing topography are examples of possible recharge methods. 
(12)  During the construction phases of land development, facilities shall be provided to prevent the erosion and washing away of the earth. Silting of downstream areas can be prevented through the strategic use of stilling basins, sodding of runoff channels, and by limiting the period of time during which the earth is stripped of vegetation. 
(13)  Final engineering plans prepared by a registered professional engineer shall show complete details for all of the items covered in this section and shall be submitted for review and approved prior to the start of construction. 
(14)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any property which has been improved, graded or developed in accordance with final engineering plans approved pursuant to this section or upon which a control structure has been installed or a by-pass channel or stormwater storage area has been constructed in accordance with such engineering plans, to alter or change any structure, grade, contour line, by-pass channel or stormwater storage area in contravention of such approved engineering plans; to alter or remove any control structure required by such approved engineering plans; to not perform the maintenance items in accordance with the approved maintenance plan; or to allow the property to remain in a condition which does not conform to such approved engineering plans in any respect. 
(15)  Enforcement. The village engineer is hereby authorized and directed to enforce all of the provisions of this chapter [appendix]. Upon presentation of proper credentials, the village engineer and his duly authorized representatives may enter at reasonable times upon any property within the village to investigate or ascertain the condition of the subject property in regard to any aspect regulated by this section. 
(16)  Duty of property owner. It shall be the duty of the owner of any property required to be improved or developed in conformance with final engineering plans approved pursuant to this section to bring such property into compliance with said engineering plans within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the village engineer that a determination has been made that the said property does not conform to final engineering plans under which said property was improved or developed. 
(17)  Variations. Because of the unique characteristics and existing intense development of a property, it is recognized that strict compliance with the stormwater detention regulations may create a particular hardship on the property owner. The owner of property may petition the village board for a variation from the stormwater detention regulations. No variation shall be granted except after a public hearing before the village board.

4.17. - Adult business uses. 
(A)  Declaration of policy. In the development and execution of these sections regulating and limiting the location of adult business uses, it is recognized that adult uses, by virtue of their nature, have serious objectionable characteristics which can have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas to them. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary purpose of these regulations is to control the concentration or location of these uses to the fullest extent allowable by law, in order to eliminate such adverse secondary effects. It is not the intent of these sections to deny adults access to sexually oriented materials and services or to deny the providers of such materials and services their market in a manner that is inconsistent with law. 
(B)  Restrictions on the location of adult business use. No adult business use shall be maintained (1) within two hundred (200) feet of any R zoning districts or uses as provided for under this ordinance; (2) within two hundred (200) feet of the property line of another adult business use; (3) within five hundred (500) feet of a church, school, library, park, or other publicly operated recreational facility. 
    The distances provided for in this section shall be measured by following a straight line without regard to intervening structures or public rights-of-way from a point on the property upon which the proposed adult business use is to be located that is nearest the property or the land use district boundary line from which the proposed use is to be separated.

9.03. - ORI-HC High Cube Subdistrict. 
    Intent. The ORI-HC High Cube Subdistrict is intended to provide for a unified development of mixed office, research and light or medium industrial uses, in a campus-like setting, which will promote and maintain desirable economic activities. Such activities shall not create appreciable nuisances or hazards but shall provide a pleasant, hazard-and-nuisance-free environment. The campus-like setting adds many unique concepts to the Office Research District. The purpose is to allow for large scale development for structures which (1) are adequately served by public improvements, (2) have access to arterial streets, and (3) will be separated from surrounding areas by substantial landscape buffering. The distinguishing feature of the High Cube Subdistrict is that structures provide for high bulk, open, free span structures typically associated with storage, warehousing and distribution facilities. As a result, the landscaping treatment required herein, at times, deviates from the standards of landscaping set forth in section 4.14 of this ordinance to provide landscaping for a large tract of property rather than smaller, scattered sites. 
(A)  General conditions. 
(1)  The minimum net development area to be located in this district shall be twenty (20) acres. 
(2)  Residential units shall not be allowed. Watchmen's dwellings shall be permitted only as accessory uses on the premises where employed. 
(3)  All business, servicing or processing, except for off-street parking and off-street loading, shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings, unless otherwise indicated hereinafter. 
(4)  Processes and equipment employed, and goods processed or sold, shall be limited to those which are not objectionable by reason of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, noise, vibrations, refuse matter, or water-carried waste. The performance standards specified in section 10.01 shall apply where appropriate to all uses in the ORI-HC District. 
(5)  All outside storage areas of goods, materials, or products shall be screened with a solid eight-foot fence (no chain link) and storage material not to exceed fence height. Maximum storage area may not exceed twenty (20) percent of proposed building footprint area. Storage shall be permitted in the rear of structures only. 
(6)  The permitted retail uses in the ORI-HC District shall be located within a building or structure containing a permitted use. 
(7)  No lot, parcel, or tract of land shall be used, and no building or structure shall be erected, altered or remodeled for any of the following uses: abattoirs; acid manufacture; arsenals; crematories; creosote treatment or manufacture; fat rendering; fertilizer manufacture; fireworks or explosive manufacture or storage; dumping or reduction of garbage, dead animals, offal or refuse; ore reduction; petroleum processing or refining; pyroxylin manufacture; synthetic polymers manufacturing; gutta percha manufacture or treatment; salt works; sauerkraut manufacture; soap manufacture; smelters; stock yards or slaughter of animals or fowl; tallow, grease or lard manufacture or treatment; tanning, curing or storage of rawhides or skins; tar distillation or manufacture; or cement concrete of asphaltic concrete batch mixing plants. 
(8)  No activities involving the storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products which decompose by detonation shall be permitted, except such as are specifically licensed by the Village of Roselle. Such materials shall include, but shall not be confined to: all primary explosives such as lead azide, lead styphnate, fulminates, and tetrocene; all high explosives such as TNT, RDX, HMX, PETN and picric acid; propellants and components thereof such as nitro-cellulose, black powder, boron dydrides, hydrazine, and its derivatives; pyrotechnics and fireworks such as magnesium powder, potassium chlorate and potassium nitrate; blasting explosives such as dynamite and nitroglycerine; unstable organic compounds such as acetylides, tetrazoles, perchloric acid, perchlorates, chlorates, hydrogen peroxide in concentrations greater than thirty-five (35) percent; and nuclear fuels, fissionable materials, and products and reactor elements such as Uranium 235 and Plutonium 239. 
(9)  Any use established in the ORI-HC District hereafter shall be operated in such a manner as to comply with applicable performance standards as hereinafter set forth governing noise, smoke, particulate matter, toxic or noxious matter, odors, fire and explosive hazards, or vibration, glare or heat. No use already established on the effective date of this ordinance shall be so altered or modified as to conflict with such applicable performance standards. Recognized testing may be required by the zoning administrator.

(A)  Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of this ordinance shall apply as follows: (1) For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective date of this ordinance, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by this ordinance. Where a use contains legal nonconforming parking and/or loading, and the total square footage of the building or the structure on the property is increased by twenty (20) percent or less, the parking space standards of this ordinance shall apply to the increased square footage, and the parking standards applicable at the time the legal nonconforming parking status occurred shall be applicable to the remainder of the building or structure. Where the total square footage of a building or structure is increased by more than twenty (20) percent, all parking shall conform to this ordinance. 
(B)  Damage or destruction. When a property is legally non-conforming as to parking and/or loading and the use or the improvement is damaged and repaired or replaced with an identical intensity of use or identical improvement, the minimum parking standards applicable at the time the use became legally nonconforming may continue. When a property is legally nonconforming as to parking and/or loading and the use of the building is changed, parking and/or loading standards shall be as described in this ordinance. 
(C)  Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the establishment of additional off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land, buildings or structures provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement, and operation of such facilities are adhered to.

SECTION 12.00. - SPECIAL USE-PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

12.01. - Purpose. 
    Planned unit developments, whether for residential, business, office-research or industrial, are unique and substantially different from conventional subdivisions and therefore require administrative processing as "special uses" in this ordinance. Planned unit developments are complex and of a different character than other special uses, requiring the establishment of more specific procedures, standards, and exceptions in order to guide the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission and to facilitate appropriate action of the village board of trustees. 
    Planned unit developments allow greater design flexibilities than is permitted by the standard regulations for land developments where the planned development would better utilize the topographic and natural character of the site and would produce a more economical and stable development while encouraging the conservation of natural features. 
    Planned unit developments are generally intended to provide for projects incorporating a single type of use or a variety of related and complementary uses which are planned and developed as a unit. Such development may provide for a wide range of development techniques and ownership methods, including conventional subdivisions, cluster developments, condominium ownership of land and buildings, or other ownership techniques. The entire development shall be controlled by means of a planned unit development ordinance and site plan which establishes densities and the approximate location of buildings and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping with the land use policies of the Roselle comprehensive plan. 
    The following objectives may be obtained through the use of the planned unit development procedure: 
(1)  To ensure that the future growth and development which occurs is in accordance with the adopted comprehensive plan and planning policies of the Village of Roselle; 
(2)  To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving and integrating the natural environmental and landscape features of the property into land development; 
(3)  To encourage developers to use a more creative approach to site design by recognizing and respecting the natural limitations and constraints of sites;

a.  The zoning board of appeals shall not vary the provisions of this ordinance as authorized in this section, unless it shall have made findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it in the following specific cases: 
1.  That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located; 
2.  That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; or 
3.  That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
b.  For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the zoning board of appeals shall also take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence: 
1.  That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out; 
2.  That the conditions upon which the petition for variation are based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning classification; 
3.  That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property; 
4.  That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; 
5.  That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
6.  That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
c.  The zoning board of appeals may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and to implement the general purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
(2)  Guidelines for variations. Variations from the regulations of this ordinance may be decided by the zoning board of appeals in accordance with the standards set forth in this section: 
a.  To permit up to a twenty (20) percent reduction in the front, side or rear yard required by this ordinance; 
b.  To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot be less than eighty (80) percent of the required area and width; 
c.  To permit the same off-street parking spaces to qualify as required spaces for two (2) or more uses, provided that the maximum use of such facility by each user does not take place during the same hours of the day or on the same days of the week; 
d.  To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or twenty (20) percent of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater; 
e.  To increase by not more than twenty-five (25) percent the maximum distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; 
f.  To allow any use to exceed by no more than twenty (20) percent of the floor area ratio, ground floor area and lot coverage imposed by the applicable regulations; 
g.  To allow any use to exceed the building height imposed by the applicable regulations by no more than twenty (20) percent but in no case shall the building height exceed five (5) stories; 
h.  To reduce the applicable landscape requirements by not more than twenty-five (25) percent of any quantitative requirement; 
i.  To extend the period of time a nonconforming use may continue or remain; 
j.  To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this section, when a lot of record or a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on the effective date of this ordinance, is, by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by any authorized governmental body or by reason of a conveyance under threat of an eminent domain proceeding, reduced in size so that the remainder of said lots does not conform with one or more of the regulations of the district in which said lot of record or zoning lot or structure is located; or 
k.  To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this section, and only where the board of zoning appeals makes specific factual findings of exceptional site, circumstances or conditions such variations shall require a favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the members of the zoning board of appeals then holding office. 
(F)  Variation: Terms of relief. The terms of relief granted shall be specifically set forth in a conclusion or statement separate from the findings of fact. 
(G)  Zoning board of appeals action. The zoning board of appeals may approve variations from the regulations of this ordinance, in accordance with the provisions of sections 13.09(F)(1) and 13.09(F)(2).

(A)  Purpose. The development and execution of the zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the village into districts, within any one of which the use of land and buildings and structures, as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories: 
(1)  Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected with a public interest, or 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect of their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(B)  Authority. Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the president and board of trustees in accordance with the Illinois Revised Statutes as amended, and the regulations and conditions set forth in this ordinance for special uses.

(1)  Legal description and common address of subject property; 
(2)  Current plat of survey locating lot lines and all existing structures; 
(3)  Proof of ownership or disclosure of beneficial trust;

e.  The relationship of the proposed zoning classification to the official comprehensive plan of Roselle, adopted on August 22, 2016. 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend the approval of a proposed special use unless it finds that: 
a.  The approval of such special use is in the public interest and not solely for the interest of the applicant; 
b.  That the proposed use at that particular location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the interest of public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or community; 
c.  That such use will not under the circumstances of the particular case be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property values or improvements in the vicinity; and 
d.  That the proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions specified in this ordinance for such use, and with the stipulations and conditions made a part of the authorization granted by the village board of trustees. 
(H)  Site plan review by the planning and zoning commission. See section 13.12. 
(I)  Conditions may be placed on a special use approval by the village that may limit construction, scheduling, location, operation and variations to minimum standards of this code as may be deemed necessary, and that protect and promote the special use criteria in section (G) above.

(K)  Effect of denial of special use. After a public hearing no application for special use which has been denied by the village board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of condition found to be valid by the planning and zoning commission and the village board. 
(L)  Repeal of special use. In any case where a special use has been granted, and where no development has taken place within two (2) years, the planning and zoning commission may recommend to the village board that such zoning be affirmed or repealed, and changed to its most appropriate zoned district classification in accordance with the procedures under this ordinance. 
(M)  Minor changes to an approved special use may be approved according to the procedures in section 13.12. 
(Ord. No. 1576-87,  1, 6-22-87; Ord. No. 1720-88,  3, 7-11-88; Ord. No. 2094-91, ㎣ 13, 14, 6-24-91; Ord. No. 2016-3858,  1, 8-22-16)

Sec. 4.03. - Dedication of park lands and school sites or for payments in lieu of dedication. 
    As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a final plat of a planned unit development, or upon issuance of building permit(s) proposing any type of residential use, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents or the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the corporate authorities of the village in accordance with the following criteria and formula. 
(A)  Criteria for requiring park and recreation land dedication. 
1.  Requirements and population ratio: The final estimated population of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be five and five-tenths (5.5) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of final estimated population. The required five and five tenths (5.5) acres may be allocated by the board of trustees in its discretion, based upon the following criteria: 
2.  Location. The Roselle Comprehensive Plan shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
Types of Recreation Area Size Range Minimum Acres per 1,000 Population a) Playlot Minimum of 8,000 square feet Not applicable b) School Park 
(Neighborhood Playground) Minimum park of 8 acres 1.25 c) Neighborhood Park Minimum of 5 acres 1.00 d) District Wide Park Minimum of 10 acres 1.25 e) Community Park Minimum of 15 acres 2.00 _____Total 5.5 acres of land per 1,000 persons  
3.  Required improvements. Each park site shall be located to front on an improved street. At least ten (10) percent of the perimeter of the site shall have lineal contiguity to a public street.

vi.  Topsoil shall be spread no later than the placement of topsoil on the first lot adjacent to the park site. 
vii.  A portion of each park site shall have soil to permit the construction of tennis courts, park buildings, or playgrounds, unless otherwise agreed. Such sites shall have a uniform soil bearing capacity of at least three thousand (3,000) psi based on soil boring data provided by the developer. 
d.  Shape: 
i.  Park sites shall be rectangular or nearly rectangular in shape. 
ii.  Non-usable areas and dead spaces shall be minimized. 
e.  Seeding: Fine grading and seeding shall be completed so that an acceptable stand of grass can be maintained prior to conveyance. 
5.  Special requirements for park sites which include storm water detention or retention areas. 
a.  Adequate overflow channels or structures shall be provided meeting all the requirements of the various agencies having jurisdiction over such water improvements. 
b.  At least sixty (60) feet of space shall be provided between static water lines of ponds and the back or side lots of the adjacent subdivision. 
c.  There shall be at least a twenty-foot suitable roadway access around the impoundment at high water level, wide enough for maintenance and emergency equipment. 
d.  On all park sites which include storm water detention areas, the following regulations will apply: 
i.  Minimum bottom surface area two hundred seventy-five (275) feet square or with one side curved (ball diamond) or a rectangle two hundred (200) feet wide by three hundred seventy-five (375) feet long (football/soccer field) with design of the entire area to be aesthetically pleasing and approved by the appropriate park district and the village. 
ii.  No more than fifty (50) percent of such park site shall hold water during a "100 year rainfall". 
iii.  At least fifty (50) percent of the available high ground within such park site shall be of sufficient size and quality to provide adequate recreational facilities, playgrounds, picnic areas, etc, unless otherwise agreed. 
iv.  Detention areas shall be so under-drained that there will be no surface water standing on such areas within twenty-four (24) hours after a "100-year rainfall". 
v.  Detention areas within parks shall be graded and seeded and an acceptable stand of maintainable grass established prior to dedication of the area to the appropriate park district. 
vi.  A "low-flow" drainage system will be incorporated into the design of the system so that the detention facility holds water only for those rainfalls in excess of a "10-year" storm. 
vii.  Detention areas nay not exceed a maximum difference of elevation of four (4.0) feet between the lowest inlet elevation and the designated overflow point. 
e.  On all park sites which include water retention, the following regulations will apply: 
i.  No more than fifty (50) percent of such park site shall hold water during a "100-year rainfall". 
ii.  At least fifty (50) percent of the site must be high ground of sufficient size and quality to provide adequate recreational facilities. 
iii.  The lake contours must be designed for aesthetic quality and recreational function (i.e. ice skating, fishing, etc.) as well as for hydraulic quality. 
iv.  Rip rap shall be provided above and below the static water level to protect the banks, and sodded above that point to the high water level (to be determined for each condition).

vi.  Retention areas may not exceed a maximum of four (4.0) feet difference of elevation between normal pool elevation and the designated overflow point. 
vi.  The developer shall provide necessary engineering calculations indicating that satisfactory aerobic conditions will be maintained. If aerobic conditions are unacceptable it shall be the responsibility of the developer to install electrical aerobic devices. 
6.  Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the subdivision or apartment development, a portion of the park and recreational area in subdivisions may, at the option of the board of trustees, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the board of trustees based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the subdivider as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(B)  Criteria for requiring school site dedication. 
1.  Requirements and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites or the amount of money to be donated in lieu thereof. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the (2) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the (3) said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. 
2.  School classification and size of school site: Classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School Classification Grades Maximum Number of Students for Each Such School Minimum Number of Acres of Land for Each School Site for Such Classifications Elementary Schools, Grades Kindergarten through 5th (K-5) 600 Students 11 acres Junior High Schools, Grades 6th through 8th (6-8) 900 Students 19 acres High Schools, Grades 9th through 12th (9-12) 2300 Students 60 acres  
3.  Location: The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
4.  Condition of site and required improvements: Each proposed school site shall be located to front on one or more public streets. At least ten (10) percent of the perimeter of the site shall have lineal contiguity to a public street. However, in no event shall such required access onto a public street be less than five hundred (500) feet in length. The requirements of section 4.03(A)4., above, regarding site topography and soil shall apply as conditions to the dedication of school sites. 
(C)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites: Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be used solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or for the improvements to any existing school site which already serves such needs. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, the village or other public body designated as trustee above shall refund such contribution to the owners of record of all lots, except lots dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this section, in the subdivision for which such contribution was made. The refund shall be paid to the person who is the owner of record on the day which is the tenth (10th) anniversary of the receipt of such contribution. The amount of the refund due to each lot owner shall be equal to the amount of the original contribution, together with accrued interest thereon, divided by the total number of lots in the subdivision (excluding only those lots which were dedicated pursuant to this section) for which such contribution was made. 
1.  Fair market value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value exclusive of any sales costs, commission and profits of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such land in and surrounding the village is no less than one-hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000) per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village by the park district, school district or others. 
2.  Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee: There will be situations in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have to be dedicated; or, A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
3.  [Payment of cash contributions.] Payment of cash contributions shall occur upon the issuance of a building permit. 
(D)  Density formula: The table of population density is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction. This table or the latest dated revision shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu of unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Population per Dwelling Unit listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the board of trustees based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider and from other sources which may be submitted to the board of trustees by the park districts, school district, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.

1.  Reservation of additional land: Where the comprehensive plan of the Village calls for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular proposed subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivided contribution shall, if so determined by the board of trustees, be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
2.  Combining with adjoining developments: Where the subdivision is less than forty (40) acres, public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or school sites without hardship on a particular subdivider. 
3.  Improved sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefore. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition of improved sites may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school sites and construction of school facilities thereon. 
4.  Title to sites: All sites shall be conveyed to the village or other public bodies as designated either by warranty or trustee's deed. The subdivider shall be responsible for conveying good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any agricultural roll back taxes which might be extended or levied against such sites, for any tax years or periods prior to the time of conveyance. Sites shall be conveyed when building permits are issued for twenty-five (25) percent of the number of numerically approved or anticipated principal uses for the entire subdivision. Conveyance shall be subject to condition of title and site being acceptable to village or other public body. 
5.  Title insurance, survey, assessment plats: Each deed or other instrument conveying land to the village, school district or park district shall be accompanied by (1) a written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do business in Illinois to insure the grantee's title to such real estate in an amount equal to its value computed pursuant to section 4.03(C)1., subject only to then current general real estate taxes, covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not prohibit the use of the subject real estate for school or park use, utility easements located within twenty (20) feet of the boundary lines of the subject real estate, and drainage ditches, feeders, laterals, and underground pipe or other conduit, and acts done or suffered by or judgment against grantee; (2) a current boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a licensed Illinois Land Surveyor to be in compliance with the Illinois Land Survey Standards; and (3) except in instances where the real estate is to be conveyed is a lot in a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be conveyed can be assigned its own permanent index number for exemption purposes. 
(E)  Hold harmless: Any school district or park district seeking dedications of land or money in lieu of land dedications under this ordinance shall enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the village which requires the school district or park district to defend, hold harmless and indemnify the Village against any and all demands, claims, actions, or causes of action brought against the village challenging any aspect of the requirements of section 4.03 et seq. of the Roselle Subdivision Ordinance as it pertains to dedication of land or money in lieu of dedications specifically for the benefited school district or park district. 
(F)  TIF district dedications or donations: The amount of land dedication or money in lieu of land dedication required by this ordinance shall not be applicable to residential developments in a tax increment financing district except to the extent that they are negotiated by the corporate authorities of the village in a tax increment financing agreement.

Particular attention shall be given to width and location of streets, lot sizes and arrangements, as well as, but not limited to local requirements such as parks and playgrounds, schools and recreation sites, and other public uses. 
(B)  Conformity with comprehensive plan. The planning and zoning commission should especially require that all divisions conform to the provisions and conditions of the official comprehensive plan. (Ordinance No. 2016-3858, adopted August 22, 2016, and as amended from time to time.) Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision does not conform to the provisions of the comprehensive plan. 
(C)  Area plan required. Where a tract of land proposed for a division is part of a larger, logical subdivision unit in relation to the village as a whole, the planning and zoning commission may, before granting approval, request that the subdivider, if he owns such tract, submit a plan for the entire area or neighborhood to be used by the planning and zoning commission as an aid in judging the proposed plan. The village engineer will make available, to the subdivider, any village information that is available concerning the area for which the plan is to be developed. 
(D)  Preservation of natural features. In all divisions, due regard shall be given to the preservation of natural features such as large trees, water courses, wetlands, wildlife habitats, historical sites or structures and similar features. 
(Ord. No. 2016-3858,  1, 8-22-16) 
SECTION 6.00. - SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES 
    The preparation of a subdivision for platting may be preceded by an initial investigation and shall go through three (3) phases: pre-application, preliminary plat, and final plat, all in accordance with the procedure as follows: 

Sec. 6.01. - Pre-application. 
(A)  Initial investigation. Prior to the preparation of a sketch plan and preliminary plat, it is suggested that the subdivider meet informally with village personnel to investigate the procedure and standards of the village with reference to this subdivision regulation ordinance and with the proposals of the comprehensive plan as they affect the area in which the proposed subdivision is located. At the subdivider's request, the zoning administrator shall organize and schedule a preapplication conference with appropriate village staff. The subdivider is encouraged to meet with the planning and zoning commission to discuss his ideas informally prior to the sketch plan phase. 
(B)  Sketch plan. 
(1)  Applicability. Any parcel of land larger than four (4) acres in area may be required to receive sketch plan approval prior to the submission of a preliminary plat of subdivision. 
(2)  Action by the subdivider. The subdivider shall submit to the zoning administrator five (5) copies of the sketch plan and all accompanying documentation in accordance with the submittal deadlines established by the community development department. The documentation shall include: 
a.  Written notification. Written notification in the form of a letter of intent from the subdivider to the planning and zoning commission establishing the subdividers intent to develop the land. 
b.  General subdivision information. General subdivision information that shall describe or outline the existing conditions of this site and the proposed development. This information shall include data on existing covenants, land characteristics, and available community facilities and utilities. Information describing the subdivision proposal shall include the number of residential lots and units broken down by type, square footage of buildings, and bedroom count; typical lot width and depth; business areas; school, playground and park areas; other public areas; street improvements; and soil boring test results. 
c.  Sketch plan. A plan prepared on reproducible medium that shall show in simple sketch form the proposed layout of streets, lots and other features in relation to existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a free hand sketch made directly on a print of the topographic survey. The sketch shall include all property owned or controlled by the applicant and those properties adjacent to or considered to be contiguous to the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan shall include the existing topographic data and contours of not more than two (2) foot intervals. Such topographic data for all or part of the plan may be provided at one foot intervals when determined necessary by the village engineer. This shall be attached to U.S.G.S. topographic data. The sketch plan should show: 
1.  Proposed name of subdivision, date and north point; 
2.  Location by township, range, section and parcel number; 
3.  Names and addresses of the subdivider and owner; 
4.  Names and addresses of the site planner, designer, engineer or surveyor who prepared the subdivision layout; 
5.  Adjacent property or property across an adjacent street, along with structures, roadways or significant features; 
6.  The location of any floodplain and wetland. 
d.  Tentative engineering proposals. Tentative engineering proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, stormwater drainage, and street improvements. 
(C)  Action by the planning and zoning commission. Upon written report by the zoning administrator and village engineer, the planning and zoning commission shall review the general subdivision information and specifically consider the following: 
(1)  Zoning verification. Check the existing zoning of the tract and advise the subdivider if a zoning change is necessary or desirable. 
(2)  Public facility impact. Determine the adequacy of existing or proposed schools, parks, and other public spaces in the vicinity of the proposed subdivision with the authorized public bodies involved. 
(3)  Site inspection. Inspect the site or otherwise determine its relationship to major streets, utility systems, and adjacent land uses, and determine any unusual problems with regard to topography, utilities, flooding, etc. 
(4)  School and park sites. Advise the developer of the potential acreage allotment, or funds in lieu thereof, to be donated and utilized for public school and park sites. 
(5)  Comprehensive plan conformity. Advise the developer of the comprehensive plan which delineates the land use areas. 
(6)  Location of floodplains and wetlands. Advise the developer of the need for a special use hearing if the proposed subdivision is located on a floodplain or wetland area as identified in the Village of Roselle Zoning Ordinance and any U.S. or state official regulatory maps. 
(7)  Subdivider advised. The planning and zoning commission, after checking the proposed sketch plan, shall advise the subdivider at that time or no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting following the presentation of the sketch plan as to the apparent adequacy of the proposed plan and shall apprise the subdivider of any requirements the village might have that should be incorporated into the design of the subdivision. At this stage, the subdivider should expect that the planning and zoning commission may require major alterations to be made in the plan if it is found necessary. 
Sec. 6.02. - Preliminary plat. 
(A)  Action by the subdivider. The subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat. Said plat shall include all of the property owned or controlled by the applicant and those properties adjacent to or considered to be contiguous to the proposed subdivision together with improvements, plans, and other supplementary material as specified shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, with written application for approval. Accompanying this preliminary plat and an application for approval shall be five (5) copies of the preliminary plat, a reduced eleven-inch by seventeen-inch print of the plat and all accompanying documentation. The required filing fee shall accompany the application. These documents are due in accordance with the submittal deadlines established by the community development department. 
(B)  Action by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall cause copies of the preliminary plat to be distributed to the appropriate village departments. The preliminary plat and any comments shall be received by the Village of Roselle Planning and Zoning Commission not less than five (5) days prior to a regular meeting of the planning and zoning commission. 
(C)  Action by the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission, zoning administrator and the village engineer shall review the preliminary plat for compliance with these regulations and other ordinances of the Village of Roselle. 
(1)  Planning and zoning commission recommendation. Within ninety (90) days of the date of application for subdivision, the planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation of approval or disapproval of the plat. The planning and zoning commission will forward its recommendation to the board of trustees including any conditions of approval, the reasons for disapproval and the roll call vote. If such plat is disapproved, the zoning administrator shall notify the subdivider in writing within ten (10) days of the date of disapproval specifying with particularity the aspects which fail to conform to village ordinances, including the official map. A recommendation of the planning and zoning commission to disapprove a preliminary plat shall not prohibit the subdivider from seeking the board of trustees approval of the proposed plat. If portions of the preliminary plat submittal are revised as a result of planning and zoning commission deliberations, copies of the revised documents shall be required for submittal to the board of trustees. Any revised drawings must be submitted to the zoning administrator no later than seven (7) days before the meeting of the board of trustees at which the petitioner requests action on his plat. 
(2)  Statement of agreement and conditions (underlying subdivision agreement). A statement of agreement and conditions summarizing approval given by the village, conditions placed upon the subdivider, commitments made by the subdivider and any other agreement or variance which is part of the applicant's preliminary plat approval shall be prepared in a form that can be executed by the village and the applicant. 
(D)  Action by the board of trustees. 
(1)  The planning and zoning commission shall forward all recommendations regarding preliminary plats to the board of trustees which may accept, modify or reject the recommendations. The board of trustees may impose such special conditions and approval of a preliminary plat as it deems necessary to insure conformity with the comprehensive plan or the requirements of village ordinances. If the board of trustees rejects a recommendation to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat or substantially modifies a preliminary plat, it shall cause a written report to be submitted to the planning and zoning commission at its next available meeting describing the rejection or substantial modification. Substantial modifications shall be those satisfying the criteria of a "major change" as defined in this ordinance. Within thirty (30) days thereafter the planning and zoning commission shall submit its comments regarding the board of trustees' report to the board of trustees who, thereafter, within thirty (30) days of its next regularly scheduled board meeting shall accept, modify or reject the preliminary plat, unless such date is mutually extended as agreed by the subdivider and board of trustees. Upon final rejection of a preliminary plat, the board of trustees shall cause a written statement setting forth the reasons for the disapproval to be submitted to the subdivider. An approved preliminary plat is tentative and only involves the general acceptability of the layout as submitted. 
(2)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum period of one year, unless, upon application of the developer, the board of trustees grants an extension. The application for said extension must be received prior to expiration and shall not require an additional filing fee or the submittal of additional copies of the preliminary plat. 
(E)  Changes. Changes to an approved preliminary plat may be approved according to the procedures in section 6.05. 
(Ord. No. 2106-91,  2, 8-12-91; Ord. No. 2457-95,  1, 3-13-95) 
Sec. 6.03. - Final plat. 
(A)  Action by the applicant. The applicant shall prepare the original drawing, one transparency print, five (5) copies, and one reduced eleven-inch by seventeen-inch copy of the final plat which shall also contain all required signed certification and agreements, other than the signed certifications of approval by the planning and zoning commission and the board of trustees, and application for development approval plus all supporting information in accordance with these regulations. Final plat documents shall be submitted to the zoning administrator in accordance with the submittal deadlines established by the community development department. 
(B)  Final plat application deadline. Application for approval of a final plat shall be made not later than one year after approval has been granted for the preliminary plat. If, after one year from preliminary plat approval, no submission of a final plat in conformance with the procedures contained herein has occurred, the preliminary plat is declared void by the board of trustees. 
(C)  Approval in phases. If desired by the subdivider, the final plat may be submitted in stages. A staged final plat may constitute only the portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that time. If the development is in stages, all staged final development plats shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved and to all requirements of these regulations. If, after one year from the approval of the most recent staged final plat, the subdivider has failed to submit an additional staged final plat, the preliminary plat, as it applies to the unsubdivided area, shall be declared void by the board of trustees. In that case, the subdivider shall be required to return to the preliminary plat phase of the subdivision process before submitting any further staged final plats. 
(D)  Action by the zoning administrator. If any final plat is substantially similar to an approved preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall refer one copy of the final engineering plans and specifications prepared in accordance with this ordinance to the village engineer in sufficient time to complete review prior to the board of trustees' consideration. Final plats will not be presented to the board of trustees until the final engineering plats and specifications have been reviewed and approved by the village engineer. After final engineering has been approved by the village engineer, the zoning administrator shall refer the final plat, together with any other complete documents required by this ordinance, to the board of trustees not less than fourteen (14) days prior to a regular meeting of the board of trustees. At that meeting, the board of trustees shall vote to approve or reject the final plat of subdivision, unless such date is mutually extended as agreed by the subdivider and board of trustees. Any final plat which is a substantial modification from an approved preliminary plat shall be referred by the zoning administrator to the planning and zoning commission for hearings in conformance with paragraph 6.02(D)(1) of this ordinance. Final plats of subdivision for a planned unit development shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for its review and recommendations as provided in the zoning ordinance. 
(E)  Statement of agreement and conditions (underlying subdivision agreement). The village staff will review and recommend on all supporting documents, engineering and financial surety. A statement of agreement and conditions shall be completed which summarizes and includes all agreements between the subdivider and the board of trustees. 
(F)  Action by the board of trustees. If, and when, the board of trustees is satisfied with the final plat and the subdivision improvement agreement, along with all improvements, conditions, documents and financial surety hereinafter noted, pertaining to said subdivision, the trustees shall by motion, approve said plat and subdivision improvement agreement and authorize and direct the president and village clerk to sign the plat for, and in the name of the village; and the clerk shall attach thereto the corporate seal. Such approval or denial shall be made within thirty (30) days of its next regularly scheduled board meeting following receipt of final plat by the zoning administrator, unless such date is mutually extended as agreed by the subdivider and board of trustees. 
(G)  Recording of final plat. At the expense of the subdivider, the village clerk shall cause the final plat and statement of agreement and conditions to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds DuPage or Cook County, Illinois. Said final plat after recording shall be returned to the office of the village clerk and a copy thereof shall be maintained on file and a copy shall be sent to the subdivider. 
(H)  Changes. Changes to an approved preliminary plat may be approved according to the procedures in section 6.05. 
(Ord. No. 2106-91,  3, 8-12-91; Ord. No. 2457-95, ㎣ 2-4, 3-13-95) 
Sec. 6.04. - Combined preliminary final plat approval. 
(A)  In order to qualify for combined preliminary final plat approval, the parcel proposed for subdivision must be less than three (3) acres in size and proposed for not more than five (5) lots not involving any new streets. 
(B)  The preliminary and final plat may be filed and approved simultaneously if all requirements for each independent review are met. The simultaneous submission does not abrogate the village's preparation of plans in their final form and is done at the subdividers expense. 
Sec. 6.05. - Changes. 
(A)  The village president may decide whether a change is major or minor. 
(B)  Major changes to preliminary and final plats and statement of agreement and conditions may be approved according to same procedures for new plats in sections 6.01-6.04. 
(C)  Minor changes to preliminary and final plats and statement of agreement and conditions may be approved or denied by the village president. 
(D)  The applicant may appeal the ruling of the village president regarding a plat to the board of trustees who, at a public hearing, may approve or deny the change.
