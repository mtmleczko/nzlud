If the customer fails to pay the undisputed portion of the bill, the utility may discontinue the customer's service pursuant to proper notice and the utility's published policy on discontinuance of service;

Such rates shall be presumed just and reasonable and shall continue in effect until the presumption is adequately rebutted through evidence received at a hearing before the authority or its designated hearing officer. A utility choosing not to adopt the FPSC approved rates must apply to the authority to establish or change rates, fees and charges, rules and regulations or conditions of service. During the pendency of the application to initially establish rates, the authority may impose rates different from those requested. If final rates are established which are lesser than those initially imposed, the authority may order a refund of the excess. If final rates are greater than those initially imposed, the authority may impose surcharges to equal the difference. In any application to the authority to establish or change rates, fees and charges, it will be the utility's burden to demonstrate through a preponderance of the evidence presented to the authority that the requested rates, fees, or charges are fair, just, and reasonable. The initial application for rate approval shall specify the proposed tariff, set forth the relief requested, and be accompanied by a complete written transcript of any testimony expected to be submitted in support of the pleadings and shall be accompanied by the documentary evidence expected to be offered by the utility. An application to change rates, fees, charges, rules and regulations, or conditions of service shall describe in detail any changes requested, the current tariff, and current tariff modified with the requested changes highlighted.

(10)  A detailed statement of rate case expenses in accordance with subsection (1); 
(11)  Rate base and rate of return in historical form for the prior three fiscal years, and for the test year and the pro forma year, at existing and proposed rates;

(g)  In determining rates, the authority: 
(1)  Shall consider the value and quality of service and the cost of providing the service; 
(2)  Shall include in the cost of providing service, at a minimum, debt interest, working capital, maintenance, depreciation, tax, and reasonable and prudent operating expenses incurred in the operation of all property used and useful in the public service; 
(3)  Shall not include contributions-in-aid-of-construction (CIAC) in the rate base of any utility; 
(4)  Shall not reduce rate base by any accumulated depreciation on CIAC;

(h)  In fixing rates, the authority may determine the prudent cost of providing service during the period of time the rates will be in effect following the entry of a final order relating to the rate request of the utility and may use such costs to determine the revenue requirements that will allow the utility to recover its prudently-incurred costs. The authority may disallow from rates any costs that it determines are not prudent and reasonable. 
(i)  An application for rate approval must be accompanied by a fee as set by the authority.

The proposed order shall state a reason or statement of good cause for granting its consent, including its judgment that the incurrence of anticipated rate case expense and other associated costs do not justify the withholding of its consent. The authority shall provide a copy of the proposed order granting consent to the utility and all interested persons who have requested notice. The proposed order will become final unless a person whose interests are substantially affected files a petition for formal evidentiary hearing in the form provided by Rule 28-106.201, Florida Administrative Code within 14 days of issuance of the proposed order. 
(k)  The authority may withhold consent to the operation of any rate request or any portion thereof by a vote to that effect within 60 days after the date of filing of the rate request, or within a shorter period established by rule of the authority. The order shall state a reason or statement of good cause for the withholding of consent. The authority shall provide a copy of the order to the utility and all interested persons who have requested notice. Such consent shall not be withheld for a period longer than eight months following the date of filing. In the event that the authority withholds consent to the operation of any rate request or any portion thereof, the authority shall hold a public hearing to determine just and reasonable rates, fees, or practices to be changed thereafter. 
(l)  Rate case expenses. 
(1)  The authority shall determine the reasonableness and prudence of rate case expenses and shall disallow all rate case expenses that are determined not to be reasonable and prudent. No rate case expense determined to be unreasonable or imprudent shall be paid by the consumer. 
(2)  To minimize rate case expense and protect its customers from increased rates, the utility filing for rate approval is encouraged to utilize in-house employees to handle its rate case. If the utility elects to secure outside consulting services for the rate case, it must demonstrate that utilizing outside consulting services is more cost-effective than utilizing in-house employees. 
(3)  The amount of rate case expense determined by the authority pursuant to the provisions of this chapter to be recovered through a utility's rate shall be apportioned for recovery over a period established by the authority. 
(m)  Rate investigations. For any rates charged that exceed those charged by an investor-owned electric utility providing electric service within the town, on its own motion or on a written customer complaint signed by a person applying for or receiving utility services, or by request of the utility itself, the authority may investigate to determine if the rates charged or collected by a utility, or if the utility's practices affecting the rates, are unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or non-compensatory, or are in violation of this chapter, or rule of the council or the authority. If it appears that any change in rates or practices may be appropriate, the authority shall hold a public hearing to determine just and reasonable rates, fees, or practices to be charged or performed thereafter. Public notice of the public hearing shall be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the town at least ten days before the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the utility and to the complainant, if any, at least 30 days before the date of the hearing. 
(n)  Affiliated transactions. The authority may review transactions with affiliates of a utility or contractually related entities of a utility to determine the appropriateness of the costs incurred and the economic value received from such transactions. 
(Ord. No. 520, § 1, 9-25-15) 
Sec. 55.06. - Fees. 
(a)  Regulatory fee. Each utility opting not to adopt rates and charges approved by the FPSC for any investor-owned electric utility serving customers within the town shall pay a regulatory fee to the authority in quarterly installments.

(Ord. No. 460, § 1, 2-24-2000) 
Sec. 91.41. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to recognize the unique characteristics of the sea turtle nesting cycle and to prevent or minimize the hazards adversely impacting nesting females and their hatchlings from any of all the following: coastal construction activity; beachfront lighting; beach/dune preservation, stabilization and restoration projects; mechanical beach cleaning; and other coastal activities disruptive to the nesting cycle. 
(Ord. No. 460, § 2, 2-24-2000) 
Sec. 91.42. - New development. 
(a)  It is the policy of the town to minimize artificial beachfront lighting and to minimize impacts to sea turtles and their nesting habitat resulting from coastal construction activities. To meet this intent, all coastal construction within the corporate limits of the town for which a building permit is issued on or after the effective date of the article shall comply with conditions set forth in this section. 
(b)  Within the jurisdictional boundaries of the town, the following lighting standards shall apply: 
(1)  Both public and private balcony and exterior lighting fixtures installed within direct line-of-sight of the beach shall be designed/positioned such that: 
a.  The point source of light or any reflective surface of the light fixture is not directly visible from the beach; and 
b.  Areas seaward of the primary dune are not directly or indirectly illuminated. 
(2)  Outside lighting shall be held to the minimum necessary for safety and security. 
(3)  Only low-intensity recessed or louvered lighting, or other appropriate low-intensity lighting, shall be used on beach access points, dune crossovers, beach walkways, piers, or any other structure designed for pedestrian traffic on or seaward of the primary dune. This lighting shall meet the same criteria for other types of exterior lights as set forth in subsection (b)(1) above. 
(4)  Facility design and site plans shall incorporate, as appropriate, the use of hedges, native dune vegetation, and/or other physical barriers (e.g., privacy fences, walls, etc.) to shield vehicular lighting from the beach. 
(5)  Temporary security lights at construction sites shall be mounted no more than 15 feet above the ground. In no case shall such lights directly illuminate any area of the beach. 
(c)  The following general standards shall apply to all coastal construction within jurisdictional boundaries of the town: 
Coastal construction occurring seaward of the primary dune during any portion of the nesting season shall be conducted during daylight hours except in emergency situations as approved by FWC or other agency having jurisdiction. 
(d)  Permanent exterior lighting resulting from coastal construction approved by the town prior to the effective date of this article shall be considered as existing development and standards set forth in 91.43 shall apply. 
(e)  Interior lighting visible from beach. The town does not intend to regulate the interior lighting of dwellings, but recommends that beachfront residents be mindful of the potentially adverse effects of their interior lighting. Beachside stairwells or lighted common areas of oceanfront units should utilize a cover, shield or window filming to diminish lighting that can be seen from the beach. Should interior lighting be so bright and so positioned as to illuminate the beach, it can create a false beacon for sea turtle hatchlings. Although the light is produced within a dwelling, that light can have consequences outside those confines. 
(Ord. No. 460, § 3, 2-24-2000) 
Sec. 91.43. - Existing development, including publicly owned lighting. 
(a)  It is the policy of the town that existing development comply with all beachfront lighting provisions of this article. To meet this intent, the following criteria shall apply to all public and private artificial exterior lights within jurisdictional boundaries of the town: 
(1)  No exterior point source of light shall be directly visible from ground level on any area of the beach; and 
(2)  No point source of light shall directly illuminate any area of the beach seaward of the primary dune. 
(b)  Within six months of the effective date of this article, exterior artificial lighting associated with existing structures that does not comply with criteria set forth in paragraph (a) above shall be modified with one or a combination of the options listed below: 
(1)  Permanently remove the fixture; 
(2)  Disconnect the point source of light; 
(3)  Reposition the fixture so the point source of light is no longer visible from the beach; 
(4)  Replace fixtures having exposed point sources with fixtures containing recessed point sources; 
(5)  Replace nondirectional fixtures with directional fixtures; 
(6)  Replace fixtures having transparent or translucent coverings with fixtures having opaque coverings; 
(7)  Affix a shield covering an arc of at least 180 degrees and extending an appropriate distance below the bottom edge of the fixture to the ocean side of an existing fixture so the light source is no longer visible from the beach; 
(8)  Replace pole lamps with low-profile luminaries; 
(9)  Plant or improve vegetation buffers between the light source and the beach to screen light from the beach; 
(10)  Construct a structural barrier to shield the light source from view; and/or 
(11)  Replace high-intensity floodlights or parking lot lights with low-pressure sodium-vapor lights. 
(c)  Permanent modifications to existing lights not conforming to standards set forth in paragraph (a) above are preferred. Temporary modifications used to bring lights into compliance with paragraph (a) must remain in effect throughout the entire nesting season each year. 
(Ord. No. 460, § 4, 2-24-2002) 
Sec. 91.44. - Prohibition of activities disruptive to sea turtles.

    Periodic nighttime lighting inspections shall be performed from the beach to determine the extent of compliance with section 4 of this article. These inspections shall be initially performed during March, 2000 by the town or a qualified person appointed or contracted by the town. Thereafter, the inspections shall be conducted at least annually until existing beachfront lighting has been brought into compliance. Inspections shall include both public and private properties within jurisdictional boundaries. 
(Ord. No. 460, § 9, 2-24-2002) 
Sec. 91.49. - Enforcement and penalty. 
    If any of the provisions of this article are being violated, the property owner or perpetrator of such violations shall be notified by written warning from the town manager's office, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering any action necessary to correct it. Enforcement action may result from inspections conducted pursuant to section 91.48 above or from public complaint. Each person who commits, attempts to commit, conspires to commit, or aids and abets in the commission of any act declared herein to be in violation of this article, whether individually or in connection with one or more persons, or as a principal, agent or accessory, shall be guilty of such offense. Any person found guilty of violating any provisions of this article, after a first written warning from the town manager's office, shall be punished in accordance with section 10.99 of this Code.

ARTICLE III. - PERMITS 

Sec. 98.25. - Permits available. 
    The following permits with stated limitations shall be available upon proper application to the tree protection officer and compliance with this chapter. 
(a)  Tree removal permit. A tree removal permit shall not authorize the destruction of a mangrove unless the criteria governing mangrove alteration is satisfied. 
(b)  Land clearing permit. A land clearing permit does not authorize the removal or destruction of protected trees, nor does it authorize any alteration to a mangrove.

(Ord. 306, 12-20-84) 
Sec. 98.26. - Criteria for issuing permits. 
    The following criteria shall be satisfied prior to issuance of a tree removal, mangrove alteration, or land clearing permit, respectively. 
(a)  Criteria for issuing a tree removal permit. In determining whether or not a permit required by this chapter should be issued, the tree protection officer shall consider the following criteria. 
(1)  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, insect attack, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures, and interference with utilities services. 
(2)  The necessity of removing a tree to construct proposed improvements in order to allow reasonable economic use of the property. 
(3)  The topography of the land where the tree is located and the effect removal of the tree would have on erosion, soil moisture retention, increased or decreased flow or diversion in the flow of surface waters, and the impact on overall surface water management. 
(4)  The number and density of trees existing on-site. 
(5)  The relative significance or uniqueness of the tree as a historic or specimen tree. 
(6)  The impact on the natural environment, including ground and surface water stabilization, water quality and aquifer recharge, ecological impacts, noise buffer, air quality, and wildlife habitat. 
(7)  The ease with which the applicant can alter or revise the proposed development or improvement in order to accommodate existing mangrove or trees. 
(8)  The economic hardship which would be imposed upon the applicant should the permit not be granted. 
(9)  If, during the review process, the tree protection officer determines any tree to be a tree of special concern as defined in this chapter, then a permit shall not be issued, if the tree is found to be outside the approved building structures perimeter, or in an area in which a swimming pool, spa, deck, driveway, roadway, detached building, or other approved construction is located or is to be located, referenced as the building area. In the event the tree of special concern is located outside the building area, then the request for the issuance of the tree removal permit shall be submitted to the planning, zoning and variance board to determine whether the permit should be granted. The planning, zoning and variance board shall determine whether the location of any improvement can be reasonably made without the necessity of removing the tree of special concern. If a reasonable alternative exists to adjust the building area, then the permit may be denied. 
(b)  Criteria for issuing a mangrove alteration permit. In determining whether or not to issue a permit, as required by this chapter to alter a mangrove, the tree protection officer shall consider not only tree removal criteria of division (a) above, but shall also consider the following criteria and incorporate them as conditions of the permit if issued. A violation of any of these provisions shall be deemed to be unlawful and subject to all penalties provided for herein. 
(1)  At least 50 percent of the original canopy of any mangrove trees shall be continuously retained. 
(2)  White mangroves and buttonwood shall not be trimmed at all at a distance less than three feet above the natural ground elevation. 
(3)  On red mangroves, no prop roots shall be damaged, removed, or buried by fill or other means. 
(4)  Red mangroves may be hedged down to a minimum height of six feet, providing the limitations in divisions (1) and (7) are not exceeded. Notwithstanding, juvenile red mangroves may be hedged down to a minimum height of three feet, providing the limitations in division (7) are not exceeded. 
(5)  On a black mangrove of ten feet or less in height there shall be no cutting or trimming below the lowest two living lateral limbs, unless a significant canopy area is left at the top of the tree. Further, no pneumatophores shall be damaged or removed nor shall they be buried by fill or other means. 
(6)  No large mangrove cuttings shall be discarded into any estuary, marsh, river, or adjacent water course. 
(7)  Pruning, removal, and relocation of mangroves shall be prohibited between December 1 and February 15. 
(8)  All cuts shall be made cleanly and at the base of the branch or limb cut, except when done with respect to the shaping of a hedge. 
(9)  A mangrove alteration permit shall not authorize removal of any mangrove unless the applicant replaces or relocates that number of mangroves necessary to revegetate an area approximately equal to the area destroyed, on the same development site. The applicant must provide an affirmative program satisfactory to the tree protection officer to assure survival of the replaced or relocated mangroves and to stabilize the shoreline from which mangroves were removed. The approved program shall be considered an express condition of the permit. 
a.  Notwithstanding the above provision, pursuant to F.S. § 403.817(2), no owner of land which is part of an authorized government mosquito control program as referenced in F.S. § 403.817(2) shall experience a property loss or gain because of vegetative changes due to mosquito control activities conducted on his property, provided these activities are or have been undertaken as part of a governmental mosquito control program. 
b.  In such cases where mangrove alteration, removal, and/or replacement permits are requested as part of a program to dredge or fill a mosquito impoundment area, the town may mandate partial restoration and/or replacement of mangroves and/or estuarine plants in order to stabilize shorelines in the impacted area. The town shall assure that related dredge and fill activities provide for and/or preserve a continuance in the circulation and flushing action of waters impacting wetlands. To this end, dredge and fill activities surrounding mangrove alteration shall not create isolated wetlands. 
(c)  Replanting and hedging program. Notwithstanding the criteria of division (b) above, the property owner/applicant may elect a replanting and hedging program, under the direction and control of the tree protection officer, and under which juvenile mangroves may be hedged several times each year and maintained at a height after periodic hedging of three feet without a permit. Such routine hedging shall be restricted to the new growth on mangrove hedges not exceeding 18 inches in height. If new growth is allowed to exceed 18 inches, subsequent trimming shall require a permit. As a mandatory and integral part of any routine hedging of mangroves, hedged material (clippings) shall be left atop the hedged mangroves until leaf drop from the hedge material (clippings) has occurred. The dropped leaves shall then become part of the estuary food chain. 
(d)  Criteria for issuing a land clearing permit. In determining whether or not to issue a permit to clear or grub land as required by this chapter, the tree protection officer shall consider whether the applicant has or is complying with all tree and land clearing provisions of this chapter and shall base a decision regarding issuance of a permit on the following criteria. 
(1)  The minimum necessary vegetation removal on the property for purposes of land surveying or land preparation for development or other economic uses. 
(2)  Whether visual access is necessary to comply with the tree survey requirements in section 98.29(c). 
(3)  Whether the applicant has provided protective barriers around all protected trees on the site or will utilize light machinery, which does not penetrate or severely compact the soil, for clearing understory vegetation in protected areas. 
(4)  The impact upon natural and manmade systems including erosion and surface water management and other impacts identified in section 98.26(a). 
a.  To this end the applicant shall provide a reasonable written plan for controlling erosion which may be expected to occur as a result of the proposed clearing or grubbing. 
b.  The plan shall incorporate some or all of the following measures necessary to achieve soil stabilization, prevent erosion, and promote efficient surface water management, including: temporary seeding and mulching, sodding, diversion berms, interceptor ditches, sediment barriers, sediment basins, and related appurtenances or devices. 
c.  All provisions of an erosion control plan shall be incorporated as express conditions of the land clearing permit issued and a violation of any of the conditions or provisions of the plan shall be considered a violation of this chapter, and subject to all enforcement provisions. 
(e)  Required written supportive documents. The tree protection officer may require written elaboration of a proposed plan prior to issuance of any type of permit herein required by this chapter in order to clarify the nature and design of measures intended by the applicant.

ARTICLE I. - FLORIDA-FRIENDLY FERTILIZER USE 

Sec. 101.01. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and permitting requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This article requires the use of best management practices (BMPs), which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. 
    These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on the town's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, canals, estuaries, creeks, and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the town residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

Sec. 157.01. - Short title. 
    The provisions contained in this chapter shall constitute the coastal construction code for construction within the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands in the town and shall be referred to as the "coastal code." 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Sec. 157.02. - Purpose; conflicting regulations. 
(a)  The purpose of the coastal code is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of the town which front on the Atlantic Ocean. These standards are intended to specifically address design features which affect the structural stability of the beach, dunes, and topography of adjacent properties. The coastal code is site specific to the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands as defined herein and is not applicable to other locations. 
(b)  In the event of a conflict between this chapter and other chapters of this code, the requirements resulting in more restrictive design shall apply. No provisions in this chapter shall be construed to permit any construction in any area prohibited by local city, county, or state regulation. 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Sec. 157.03. - Scope. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this coastal code shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands in the town. 
(1)  The new construction of, or improvement to major structures, nonhabitable major structures, and minor structures as defined in § 157.04. 
(2)  Construction which would change or alter the character of the shoreline (excavation, grading, paving). The coastal code does not apply to minor work in the nature of normal beach cleaning or debris removal. 
(b)  Effect on existing structures. The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to existing structures, structures under construction, or structures for which a valid and unexpired municipal or county building permit was issued prior to the adoption of the coastal code. 
(c)  Multi-zone structures. For structures located partially in the coastal building zone, the requirements of the coastal code shall apply to the entire structure. 
(d)  Construction seaward of mean high water. Structures or construction extending seaward of the mean high water line which are regulated by F.S.A. § 161.041, (groins, jetties, moles, breakwaters, seawalls, revetments, beach nourishment, inlet dredging, and the like), are specifically exempt from the provisions of this chapter. In addition, the coastal code does not apply to piers, pipelines, or outfalls which are regulated pursuant to the provisions of F.S.A. § 161.053. 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Sec. 157.04. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    Beach. The zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low water line to the place where there is marked change in materials or physiographic form, or to the line of permanent vegetation, usually the effective limit of storm waves. Beach is alternatively termed shore. 
    Breakaway wall or frangible wall. A partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces, but will fail under hydrostatic, wave, and runup forces associated with the design storm surge. Under these conditions, the wall shall fail in a manner such that it breaks up into components that will minimize the potential for damage to life or adjacent property. 
    Building support structure. Any structure which supports floor, wall, or column loads, and transmits them to the foundation. The term shall include beams, grade beams, or joists, and includes the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles, columns, or footings. 
    Coastal barrier islands. Geological features which are completely surrounded by marine waters that front upon the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean and are composed of quartz sands, clays, limestone, oolites, rock, coral, coquina, sediment, or other materials, including soil disposal, which features lie above the line of mean high water. Mainland areas which were separated from the mainland by artificial channelization for the purpose of assisting marine commerce shall not be considered coastal barrier islands. 
    Coastal building zone. All the land in the town. 
    Column action. The potential elastic instability in piles or columns resulting in axial or lateral bending of the member due to compressive stress. 
    Construction. The carrying out of any building, clearing, filling, or excavation or the making of any material change in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land. When appropriate to the context, construction refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. 
    Design storm. The 100-year storm event, including a storm surge equivalent to the base flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Dune. A mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized, lying landward of the beach, and deposited by natural or artificial means. 
    Major structure. Includes but is not limited to residential buildings including mobile homes, commercial, institutional, industrial, and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones. 
    Mean high water line. The intersection of the tidal plane of mean high water with the shore. Mean high water is the average height of high waters over a 19-year period. (See F.S.A. § 177.27(15)) 
    Minor structure.

ARTICLE II. - COASTAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 157.20. - Compliance required. 
    Construction within the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands shall meet the requirements of this chapter. All structures shall be designed so as to minimize damage to life, property, and the natural environment. Assistance in determining the design parameters to minimize this damage may be found in the reference documents listed in § 157.27. 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Cross reference- Penalty, § 10.99. 
Sec. 157.21. - Permit application. 
    Applications for building permits for all construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands shall be certified by an architect or professional engineer registered in the state. The certification shall state that the design plans and specifications for the construction are in compliance with the criteria established by this coastal code and shall include a copy of all design calculations, which shall be submitted to the Department of Buildings. 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Sec. 157.22. - Major structures. 
(a)  Foundations. All major structures shall be anchored to their foundations in such a manner as to prevent flotation, collapse, uplift, or lateral displacement. Foundation design and construction shall consider all anticipated loads resulting from design storm conditions, including wave, hydrodynamic, hydrostatic, and wind loads acting simultaneously with dead loads. Erosion computations for foundation design shall account for all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces, including localized scour due to the presence of structural components. 
(1)  Pile foundations shall be required for buildings located in Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Map "V" (velocity) zones, the easternmost 250 feet of the "C" flood zone or where impacted by wave action, other than single-family residences. 
a.  Pile dimensions, spacing, and embedment shall be designed consistent with the requirements of the site, taking into account all vertical, lateral, erosion, and scour-producing forces. 
b.  Piles shall be driven to a penetration which achieves adequate bearing capacity taking into consideration the anticipated loss of soil above the design grade. 
c.  In addition to the normal foundation analysis, the pile foundation analysis shall consider piles in column action, where appropriate, from the bottom of the support structure to the design grade. 
d.  Consideration shall also be given to the degree of exposure to wave attack and the resulting impact loads on lateral or diagonal bracing between piles. 
(2)  Monolithic foundations may be permitted in Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Map "A" or "B" zones or in locations not impacted by wave action. 
a.  Monolithic foundations may be used if soil conditions permit and if located at an elevation which minimizes their effect on the beach and adjacent properties. Due consideration shall be given to their vulnerability to erosion under design storm conditions. 
b.  In the event that a monolithic foundation is used, the maximum elevation of the top of the slab is to be below the design scour depth (see Chapter 5.28, Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 4th edition, 1984) unless positive methods are provided to prevent scour. 
c.  Other types of spread footings such as running footers or pads may be permitted when positive methods are provided to prevent scour. 
(b)  Understructures. No substantial walls or partitions shall be constructed below the level of the first finished floor. This does not preclude the construction of the following. 
(1)  Stairways. 
(2)  Shearwalls essentially perpendicular to breaking waves. 
(3)  Shearwalls essentially parallel to breaking waves which do not exceed a maximum of 20% of the building length. 
(4)  Wind or sand screens constructed of fabric or wire mesh. 
(5)  Light open lattice partitions with individual wooden lattice strips no greater than three-fourths-inch thick or three inches wide. 
(6)  Elevator shafts. 
(7)  Breakaway or frangible walls. 
(8)  Substantial building walls constructed above the wave action and storm surge expected under design storm conditions. 
(c)  Building and floor elevations. The minimum elevation for the underside of the building support structure (excluding foundation) shall be above the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed on the storm surge with dynamic wave setup expected under design storm conditions. The elevation of the storm surge with dynamic wave setup shall be either the elevation established by the State Department of Natural Resources Coastal Construction Control Line Study or the base flood elevation for the specific area established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as determined by the design engineer. 
(d)  Erosion and design grade. The elevation of the soil surface to be used in the design of foundations, calculation of pile reactions, and bearing capacities shall not be greater than that which would result from the erosion reasonably anticipated as a result of design storm conditions. Calculation of the design grade shall take into account localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Erosion computations for foundation design shall consider all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces. 
(e)  Wave force design. 
(1)  Calculations for wave forces resulting from design storm conditions on building foundations and superstructures may be based upon the minimum criteria and methods prescribed in the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Design Manual, NAVFAC DM-26, U.S. Department of Navy; Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Department of the Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Department of the Army Coastal Engineering Research Center Technical Papers and Reports; the Technical and Design Memoranda of the Division of Beaches and Shores, State Department of Natural Resources; or other professionally recognized methodologies which produce equivalent design criteria. 
(2)  Breaking, broken, and nonbreaking waves shall be considered as applicable. Design wave loading analysis shall consider vertical uplift pressures and all lateral pressures to include impact as well as dynamic loading and the harmonic intensification resulting from repetitive waves. 
(f)  Hydrostatic loads. Calculations for hydrostatic loads shall consider the maximum water pressure resulting from a fully peaked, breaking wave superimposed upon the design storm surge with dynamic wave setup. Both free and hydrostatic loads shall be considered. Hydrostatic loads which are confined shall be determined using the maximum elevation to which the confined water would freely rise if unconfined. Vertical hydrostatic loads shall be considered both vertically downward and upward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of major structures such as floors, slabs, roofs, and walls. Lateral hydrostatic loads shall be considered as forces acting horizontally above and below grade on vertical or inclined surfaces. Hydrostatic loads on irregular or curved geometric surfaces shall be determined by considering the separate vertical and horizontal components acting simultaneously under the distribution of the hydrostatic pressures. 
(g)  Hydrodynamic loads. Hydrodynamic loads shall consider the maximum water pressures resulting from the motion of the water mass associated with the design storm. Full intensity loading shall be applied on all structural surfaces above the design grade which would affect the flow velocities. 
(h)  Design conditions. 
(1)  Foundations for all major structures shall be designed for the horizontal and vertical pressures generated by wave forces between the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed upon the storm surge and the stable soil elevation of the site. 
(2)  All major structures shall be designed to withstand 140 m.p.h. windspeeds. Horizontal wind velocity pressures shall not be less than the values given below.

Sec. 157.25. - Location of construction. 
    Construction, except for elevated walkways, lifeguard support stands, piers, beach access ramps, gazebos, and coastal or shore protection structures, shall be located a sufficient distance landward of the beach to permit natural shoreline fluctuations and to preserve dune stability. Construction, including excavation, may occur to the extent that the natural storm buffering and protection capability of the dune is not diminished. 
(Ord. 336, 2-27-86) 
Sec. 157.26. - Public access. 
    Where the public has established an accessway through private lands to lands seaward of mean high tide or water line by prescription, prescriptive easement, or any other legal means, development or construction shall not interfere with the right of access unless a comparable alternative accessway is provided. The developer shall have the right to improve, consolidate, or relocate these public accessways so long as they are: 
(1)  Of substantially similar quality and convenience to the public; 
(2)  Approved by the local government; and 
(3)  Consistent with the coastal management element of the local comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to F.S.A. § 163.3178.

Sec. 160.10. - Reserved. 
Sec. 160.11. - PRD: planned residential district. 
(A)  Purpose. The primary purpose of the Planned Residential District (PRD) is to permit land under unified control to be planned and developed as a whole (as a single operation or an approved series of operations) with a greater amount of flexibility by removing some of the detailed restrictions of conventional zoning. PRD are recognized as serving the public interest and are encouraged for the following reasons: 
(1)  To allow diversification of uses, structures and open spaces when not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting properties; 
(2)  To reduce improvement costs through a more efficient use of land and a smaller network of utilities and streets than is possible through application of standards contained in conventional land development regulations and site designs; 
(3)  To conserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging the preservation and improvement of scenic and functional space; 
(4)  To provide maximum opportunity for application of innovative site planning concepts to the creation of aesthetically pleasing environments for living on properties of adequate size, shape and location; 
(5)  To ensure that development will occur according to limitations of land use, site design, population density, building coverage, improvement standards and construction phasing authorized through the approval of a master development plan; and 
(6)  To ensure that development will be consistent with the intent of the comprehensive plan and this Code. 
(B)  Unified control. All land included for the purpose of development within a PRD shall be under the control of the applicant (an individual, partnership, company or corporation, or group of individuals, partnerships, companies or corporations). The applicant shall present satisfactory legal documents to constitute evidence of the unified control of the entire area. The applicant shall agree in the application for rezoning to the following: 
(1)  To proceed with the proposed development according to the provisions of these regulations, and conditions attached to the rezoning of the land to PRD and the approved master development plan; 
(2)  To provide agreements, contracts, covenants, deed restrictions and sureties acceptable to the town for completion of the development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning to PRD, and for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated or maintained at public expense; 
(3)  To bind their successors in title to any commitments made under the above. All agreements and evidence of unified control shall be examined by the planning, zoning and variance board and no rezoning of land to PRD classification shall be adopted without a certification by the town Attorney that such agreements and evidence on unified control meet the requirements of these regulations; 
(4)  If the developer elects to administer common open space through an association or nonprofit corporation, said organization shall conform to the applicable laws of the State of Florida.

A map depicting the area shall be maintained in the office of the town clerk. For properties located partially within the jurisdictional boundary, the requirements of this chapter shall apply to the entire property. 
    Light fixture. The structural mechanism which, or within which, the point source of light is attached. 
    Low-profile luminaire. A light fixture set on a base where the point source of light is no higher than 48 inches off the ground and is designed in such a way that light is directed downward from hooded light source. 
    Motorized vehicle. Includes, but is not limited to, any self-propelled, wheeled, tracked or belted conveyance. 
    Nesting season. The period from March 1 through October 31 each year during which sea turtles emerge from the ocean to nest and hatchlings emerge from nests to enter the ocean. 
    Permit holder. Any qualified individual, group or organization possessing a current and valid permit from FWC to conduct activities related to sea turtle conservation and recovery. 
    Person. Any individual, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, syndicate, fiduciary, company, corporation, group or other entity or unit, or federal, state, county or municipal government. 
    Point source of light. The actual exterior light source such as the bulb, fluorescent tube, lamp, etc. from which light emanates. 
    Pole light. Any light fixture set on a base or pole where the point source of light is higher than 48 inches off the ground. 
    Primary dune. Dune means a mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized, lying landward of the beach and deposited by natural or artificial means. 
(B)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to recognize the unique characteristics of the sea turtle nesting cycle and to prevent or minimize the hazards adversely impacting nesting females and their hatchlings from any or all of the following: coastal construction activity; beachfront lighting; beach/dune preservation, stabilization and restoration projects; mechanical beach cleaning; and other coastal activities disruptive to the nesting cycle. 
(C)  New development. 
(1)  Minimize artificial light. It is the policy of the town to minimize artificial beachfront lighting and to minimize impacts to sea turtles and their nesting habitat resulting from coastal construction activities. To meet this intent, all coastal construction within the corporate limits of the town for which a building permit is issued on or after the effective date of the article shall comply with conditions set forth in this section. 
(2)  Lighting standards. In the town's jurisdictional boundaries, the following lighting standards shall apply: 
(a)  Both public and private balcony and exterior lighting fixtures installed within direct line-of-sight of the beach shall be designed/positioned such that: 
(i)  The point source of light or any reflective surface of the light fixture is not directly visible from the beach; and 
(ii)  Areas seaward of the primary dune are not directly or indirectly illuminated. 
(b)  Outside lighting shall be held to the minimum necessary for safety and security. 
(c)  Only low-intensity recessed or louvered lighting, or other appropriate low intensity lighting, shall be used on beach access points, dune crossovers, beach walkways, piers or any other structure designed for pedestrian traffic on or seaward of the primary dune. This lighting shall meet the same criteria for other types of exterior lights as set forth in subsection (2)(a) above. 
(d)  Facility design and site plans shall incorporate, as appropriate, the use of hedges, native dune vegetation and/or other physical barriers (e.g., privacy fences, walls, etc.) to shield vehicular lighting from the beach. 
(e)  Temporary security lights at construction sites shall be mounted no more than 15 feet above the ground. In no case shall such lights directly illuminate any area of the beach. 
(f)  Permanent exterior lighting resulting from coastal construction approved by the town prior to the effective date of this article shall be considered as existing development and standards set forth in section (D) below shall apply. 
(g)  The town does not intend to regulate the interior lighting of dwellings, but recommends that beachfront residents be mindful of the potentially adverse effects of their interior lighting. Beachside stairwells or lighted common areas of oceanfront units should utilize a cover, shield or window filming to diminish lighting that can be seen from the beach. Should interior lighting be so bright and so positioned as to illuminate the beach, it can create a false beacon for sea turtle hatchlings. Although the light is produced within a dwelling, that light can have consequences outside those confines. 
(3)  General standards for coastal construction. Coastal construction occurring seaward of the primary dune during any portion of the nesting season shall be conducted during daylight hours except in emergency situations as approved by FWC or other agency having jurisdiction. 
(D)  Existing development, including publicly owned lighting. 
(1)  Beachfront lighting criteria. Existing development must comply with all beachfront lighting provisions of this section. To meet this intent, the following criteria shall apply to all public and private artificial exterior lights within jurisdictional boundaries of the town: 
(a)  No exterior point source of light shall be directly visible from ground level on any area of the beach; and 
(b)  No point source of light shall directly illuminate any area of the beach seaward of the primary dune. 
(2)  Required timing of lighting modifications. Exterior artificial lighting associated with existing structures that does not comply with criteria set forth in section (D)(1) above shall be immediately modified with one or a combination of the options listed below: 
(a)  Permanently remove the fixture; 
(b)  Disconnect the point source of light; 
(c)  Reposition the fixture so the point source of light is no longer visible from the beach; 
(d)  Replace fixtures having exposed point sources with fixtures containing recessed point sources; 
(e)  Replace non-directional fixtures with directional fixtures; 
(f)  Replace fixtures having transparent or translucent coverings with fixtures having opaque coverings; 
(g)  Affix a shield covering an arc of at least 180 degrees and extending an appropriate distance below the bottom edge of the fixture to the ocean side of an existing fixture so the light source is no longer visible from the beach; 
(h)  Replace pole lamps with low-profile luminaries; 
(i)  Plant or improve vegetation buffers between the light source and the beach to screen light from the beach; 
(j)  Construct a structural barrier to shield the light source from view; and/or 
(k)  Replace high-intensity floodlights or parking lot lights with low-pressure sodium-vapor lights. 
(3)  Permanent and temporary lighting modifications. Permanent modifications to existing lights not conforming to standards set forth in section (D)(1) above are preferred. Temporary modifications used to bring lights into compliance with section (D)(1) must remain in effect throughout the entire nesting season each year. 
(E)  Prohibition of activities disruptive to sea turtles. To protect sea turtles and their hatchlings, the following activities are prohibited on or seaward of the primary dune during the nesting season (March 1-October 31): 
(1)  The operation of motorized vehicles, except in cases of emergency or as otherwise approved by FWC or the town; 
(2)  Horseback riding; and 
(3)  Campfires. 
(F)  Standards for beach access points. To increase general public awareness of the need for protecting sea turtles and to alert the public to possible penalties resulting from the molestation of sea turtles or the destruction of their nests and eggs, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Permanent sea turtle information signs. Permanent sea turtle information signs shall be posted by the town at all public beach access points provided with dune crossovers. The signs shall be standardized by the town and positioned to be conspicuous to persons accessing the beach. 
(G)  Beach/dune preservation, stabilization or restoration. All coastal construction within jurisdictional boundaries associated with beach/dune preservation, stabilization or restoration projects shall comply with the following conditions: 
(1)  Coastal construction activities occurring seaward of the primary dune during any portion of the nesting season shall be conducted during daylight hours except in emergency situations as approved by FWC or the town. 
(2)  Restored and stabilized dunes shall be vegetated with authorized native, salt-tolerant plants suited to the beach/dune environment and irrigated by a temporary sprinkler system which does not broadcast water seaward of the toe of the primary dune. 
(H)  Standards for mechanical beach cleaning. A permit is required from the FDEP and the town for all beach cleaning activities to remove debris from the beach through the use of motorized vehicles or other mechanical means. In addition, beach cleaning activities shall comply with the following conditions: 
(1)  Beach cleaning shall be conducted only during daylight hours; 
(2)  Any person engaging in mechanical beach cleaning activities during any portion of the nesting season shall satisfy all local, state and federal laws prior to engaging in such activities; and 
(3)  All beach cleaning operations shall be coordinated through the appropriate state agency to ensure that these operations do not interfere with state sanctioned scientific studies of sea turtles nesting activities. 
(I)  Compliance inspections. Periodic nighttime lighting inspections shall be performed from the beach to determine the extent of compliance with this article. The inspections shall be conducted at least annually until existing beachfront lighting has been brought into compliance. Inspections shall include both public and private properties within jurisdictional boundaries. 
(J)  Enforcement and penalty. If any of the provisions of this article are being violated, the property owner or perpetrator of such violations shall be notified by written warning from the town code enforcement officer, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering any action necessary to correct it. Enforcement action may result from inspections conducted as provided above or from public complaint. Each person who commits, attempts to commit, conspires to commit or aids and abets in the commission of any act declared herein to be in violation of this article, whether individually or in connection with one or more persons, or as a principal, agent or accessory, shall be guilty of such offense. Any person found guilty of violating any provisions of this article, after a first written warning from the town code enforcement officer, shall be punished in accordance with section 10.99 of the Town Code of Ordinances. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition to any other remedies, civil or criminal, violations of this article may at the option of the town be enforced by the code enforcement board, which may impose administrative fines and liens in accordance with the town's code enforcement board ordinance. 
(K)  Local approvals not exclusive. Approvals required pursuant to this article shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any federal, state, regional or other local approvals which may be required for the same or similar activities. Similarly, compliance with provisions of this article does not excuse any person from having to comply with other applicable federal, state, regional or local laws.

(3)  Location. These landscaped areas shall be located to most effectively relieve the monotony of large expanses of paving and contribute to the orderly circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Landscaped areas, wall structures and walks shall require protection from vehicular encroachment of overhang through appropriate wheel stops or curbs. A minimum of two and one-half feet shall be provided between the wheel stop and the landscape feature or the same distance of sod between the curb and the wall, walk or landscaping. 
(4)  Exceptions. In other vehicular use areas where the stringent application of this section will seriously restrict the area's function, the required landscaping may be situated close to the perimeter of the paved area, including those perimeters which may be adjacent to a building on the site. The required interior landscaping which is relocated as provided herein shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 163.07. - Intersection visibility. 
(A)  Unobstructed vision. When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way or when the subject property abuts the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way, all landscaping within the triangular areas described in (B) below shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between three feet and six feet. Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in a manner so that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility area shall be allowed, provided they are so located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except required grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any accessway pavement. 
(B)  Visibility triangle. The triangular areas referred to in (A) above are as follows: 
(1)  Intersection with one public R/W. The areas of property on both sides of an accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and the public right-of-way, with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two other sides; and 
(2)  Intersection with two or more public R/W. The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way with two sides of the triangular area being 30 feet in length along the abutting public right-of-way lines, measured from their point of intersection, and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 163.08. - Water conservation.

(1)  Single-family detached dwellings. The landscape plan submitted prior to certificate of occupancy shall reflect the drainage plan approved in conjunction with the plat approval. 
(2)  Site plans. The landscape plan accompanying a site plan shall clearly indicate that the design of the building and landscape has considered water detention, swales and/or run-off via structural drains. Surface water management systems shall be designed and constructed to (a) detain with filtration or retain, as a minimum, run-off from a 25-year frequency, 24-hour design storm and (b) assure that post development run-off from the site shall not exceed pre-development rates, as required in sections 168.02.4(B)(4) and 168.04(I)(5). 
(D)  Sod limitations and other xeriscape requirements. 
(1)  Sod requirements. The grassed area shall not exceed 50 percent of the landscaped area excluding right-of-way and easements. Grass areas shall be designed to maintain a minimum width of four feet except at the point of termination. 
(2)  Xeriscape. Ninety percent of all plantings introduced to the site shall consist of drought-tolerant species as recognized by the town building official. Other species may be used if authoritative sources are provided to establish that the species are drought-tolerant. The landscape design shall consider and locate plants in zones according to their water needs. 
(3)  Tree placement. Tree locations shall provide a minimum of 50 percent shade profile of building structures and hard paved surfaces, excluding approved pool and recreational paved deck areas. These trees shall be placed within 25 feet of the structure or hard paved surface to project the maximum shade profile. Shading of outdoor air conditioning units (in a ten-foot radius thereof) shall be required. 
(4)  Installation. All introduced landscape plantings shall be installed by industry accepted horticultural and nursery practices to aid in establishment of the plant. 
(E)  Irrigation systems. 
(1)  Zones. The irrigation system shall have zones designed to calibrate water application within each zone in accordance with the needs of the plantings. Emphasis shall be placed on a system supplying water at an acceptable rate to reduce run-off Irrigation zoning shall separate the grass areas independent from planting areas. Matched precipitation rates are required within each zone (100 percent coverage with 90 percent overlap). 
(2)  Special zones. Plantings determined by the town building official to be high water usage plants (e.g. azalea and annuals) must be irrigated separately from other areas. Elevated planters must be irrigated separately of all other areas, including enclosed planters with extended sides and/or bottoms. High water usage plants in these elevated or enclosed planters will not require additional separation. 
(3)  Timers. Irrigation controller units shall sequence turf and planting zones. Where more than one controller unit is installed, one unit shall control grass zones and one unit shall control planting zones. 
(4)  Sensors. Moisture sensors shall be installed with each irrigation system controller unit. This equipment must be approved by the town building official. All equipment shall be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and maintained in proper working order.

(7)  Protected trees. Trenching for the installation of sprinkler lines within the protected area of a protected tree is prohibited. Tunneling is acceptable to reduce adverse impact to the tree's roots. Irrigation lines may be surface installed within the protected area. 
(F)  Temporary suspension of landscaping requirements. 
(1)  Conditions of temporary suspension. Landscaping installation pursuant to the provisions of this section may be temporarily suspended in individual cases by the town building official in one of the following cases: 
(a)  Freeze. After a freeze when required landscape materials are not available; or 
(b)  Drought. During a period of drought when the use of water is restricted by a governmental authority; or 
(c)  Natural disaster. As declared by the town manager. 
(2)  Surety bond required. The suspension of planting shall be conditioned upon the provision by the applicant of a bond or similar surety which, in the opinion of the town, is sufficient to guarantee compliance with the minimum planting requirements of this section. 
(G)  Final inspection. Failure to comply with this section can result in the withholding of the certificate of occupancy or prosecution before the code enforcement board. Final approval rests with the town building official. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 163.09. - Fences, walls and hedges. 
(A)  Residential districts. The following provisions apply only between the building setback lines and the property lines. 
(1)  Rear yard. Walls, fences or hedges placed in the area from the rear of the dwelling to the rear lot line shall not exceed six feet in height, except on riverfront or oceanfront property, in which case the walls, fences or hedges shall not exceed four feet in height. Walls, fences or hedges may be built up to the side and rear property line. 
(2)  Side yard. Walls, fences or hedges placed in the area of the side yard shall not exceed six feet in height. The walls, fences or hedges may be built up to the side yard property line and shall not extend beyond the building line of the single-family or multifamily dwelling. 
(3)  Front yard. Walls and fences (but not hedges) placed in the area of the front yard shall not exceed four feet in height. The walls or fences may be built up to the side or front property line. Any such wall or fence shall be landscaped on the street side. 
(4)  Measuring height. If the elevation of the lot at the time of platting is below the minimum finished floor elevation as required by town ordinance, the wall, fence or hedge height will be measured from the town required minimum finished floor elevation. If the elevation of the lot at the time of platting is above the minimum finished floor elevation as established by town ordinance, the grade from which the height of a wall, fence or hedge is to be measured shall be the elevation of the ground at the time of platting. In no event will more than six feet of wall, fence or hedge be visible from any direction. 
(5)  Fencing. Fencing shall be planted with landscape material not less than 18 inches in height so that the fence shall be covered in a reasonable period of time. This restriction of height and landscaping does not apply to tennis, temporary construction or agricultural fencing. Fences abutting a street or adjacent residence or residential lot shall have the required landscape material planted on the street side, adjacent residence or residential lot side of the fence as appropriate. 
(6)  Construction and maintenance. Concrete block walls shall be smoothly troweled, stuccoed and painted. All other types of walls and fences shall be finished in accordance with standard building practices. All walls and fences shall be maintained in good repair and kept structurally sound.

(8)  Walls along A1A. In cases of walls and fences running parallel and adjacent to nonresidential properties or A1A, walls may be a maximum of six feet in height. The planning, zoning and variance board and town council shall approve the design of all such walls or fence as a part of the site plan or subdivision process. Unbroken wall expanses shall not be permitted; off-sets, variety of materials, landscaping, etc. shall be used to avoid this. Hedges running parallel and adjacent to nonresidential properties or A1A shall be unrestricted in height, provided however hedges shall not be permitted that cause a traffic hazard. 
(9)  Buffer between single-family and multi-family districts. Where single-family districts abut multi-family districts, single-family homeowners may construct a buffer fence or wall. 
(10)  Design review. All walls and fences shall be designed and constructed so as to present a finished and attractive appearance to the outside or neighboring property. Any new single-family detached house shall have any proposed wall or fence reviewed by the design review committee. Any fence or wall proposed for an existing single-family detached lot shall require site plan approval. 
(11)  Utility easements. No wall, fence or hedge shall be erected within town utility easements unless prior approval is obtained from the town council. 
(B)  Nonresidential district buffers. 
(1)  Screening wall. A six-foot unpierced wall or fence shall be provided in nonresidential districts where the boundary line districts are adjacent to or across a street or alley from residential districts. The wall shall screen all parking. 
(2)  Buffer strip alternative. 
(a)  Wherever in this chapter an unpierced wall or fence is required, a buffer strip of not less than ten feet in width may be permitted in lieu of the required unpierced wall or fence upon a finding by the town council during site plan review that the buffer strip would provide equal or greater protection to the residential district from any adverse effects from the use of the nonresidential district. 
(b)  Whenever in this chapter a buffer strip is permitted, it shall be landscaped within 30 days from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the use which requires the buffer strip, and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials to provide a suitable screen equal in characteristics to a wall. 
(C)  Gateposts. Any gate post or entrance post at any entry or exit to or from residential development shall not exceed eight feet in height. Any wall attached to or made a part of the gate post or entrance post shall not exceed six feet in height with a taper from the gate post or entrance post for a distance not to exceed four feet in the beginning of the wall. 
(D)  Traffic hazard. Wherever in this chapter an unpierced wall or fence is required, the town council may reduce the required height or may waive the requirement where the wall or fence is required to be erected within 40 feet of a street right-of-way if the town council finds that the construction of the wall or fence as required would constitute a traffic hazard.

Chapter 164 - SIGNS 

Sec. 164.01. - Intent. 
    It is hereby determined that street graphics are a necessity within the town to generally inform the public as to regulations, hazards, locations and activities. Signs are also necessary to substitute for house numbering and identification of businesses. Uncontrolled signs however can create hazards, confusion, poor aesthetics, loss of business, loss of tax revenues, clutter and garishness; adversely affect the stability and value of property; produce degeneration of property with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the safety, health, and welfare of the town; and destroy the proper relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services. It is therefore found that all commercial and development identification signs within the town should be reviewed for their effect upon the town through the planning, zoning and variance board. It is further found that display cases fall within the same character as signs and shall be governed by these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 164.02. - Illuminated signs. 
    Signs which are illuminated from within or are backlit are prohibited.

Sec. 164.05. - Construction signs. 
    Whenever a building permit has been issued for the construction, alteration or repair of a structure and work is in progress on the site pursuant to the permit, contractors or architects engaged in the work during the time the work is going on may display on the site their sign, provided that: 
(1)  No individual sign displayed on the building site shall be of an area larger than six square feet; 
(2)  No individual contractor or architect shall display more than one sign on any building site at any given time; and 
(3)  The total area of construction signs displayed at any one time on the building site, considered together, shall not exceed ten square feet. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 164.06. - Real estate signs. 
(A)  Size and allowable copy. Signs that indicate that the premises are for sale or for rent are limited to one sign for each property frontage involved.

(1)  That the property is for sale, lease or exchange by the owner or his agent; 
(2)  The owner's or agent's name; 
(3)  The owner's or agent's address and telephone number; or 
(4)  When appropriate to the occasion, the words "open house" or "inquire within." 
(B)  Temporary real estate signs. Temporary signs may be made of the same material permitted for permanent signs, and in addition may be made of less durable materials and woods such as pasteboard. In no event shall temporary signs be self-illuminated, luminescent, fluorescent or have any characteristics which will make them glow or shine. These signs shall be removed upon agreement of sale, exchange or lease. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 164.07. - Signs in commercial districts. 
(A)  Design review. Except for signs authorized in section 164.06, all signs and display cases in commercial districts shall be subject to design approval by the planning, zoning and variance board at the time of site plan review. The following criteria shall be used: 
(1)  Its compatibility with the architecture of the building and the location on the site; and 
(2)  The extent to which it would create confusion to the public or to police and fire response calls in emergencies, or tend to degrade the character of the town due to the garishness of its design. 
(B)  Design standards. 
(1)  A building with 40 feet or less frontage on a public way may have one ground sign not exceed ten square feet and ten square feet of wall signs.

Sec. 164.08. - Signs on residential lots. 
(A)  Residential district signs. Allowable signs on individual lots in residential districts include the following: 
(1)  House name signs and occupants' name plates. These are signs which, by their nature and wording, identify either the house or its occupant or both, and which essentially take the place of house numbers. These signs may include pictorial and decorative designs as well as words, and may be in a shape or form, but shall not exceed two square feet in area.

Chapter 165 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT AND DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 165.01. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(A)  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Florida has in F.S. ch. 163 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    Therefore, the town does ordain as follows: 
(B)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(C)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which resulting damage causes and increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  See also chapters 496 and 509. 
(D)  Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 165.02. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Addition (to an existing building). Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction.

(7)  Impact on flood levels. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(i)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(B)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in section 165.03(B) or section 165.04(C)(11), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 165.05(B)(3). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and use structural components that have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the town building official as set forth in section 165.04(C)(9). 
(3)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
(a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
(i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
(iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
(b)  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
(c)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 165.03(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Prohibit encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(b)  If section 165.05(B)(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 165.05; and 
(c)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 165.05(A)(2), and the elevation standards of section 165.05(B)(1) and the encroachment standards of section 165.05(B)(4)(a) are met. 
(5)  Coastal high hazard areas (V zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 165.03(B) are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  All building shall be located landward of the Florida coastal construction control line as established in 1987 and as subsequently amended, of the mean high tide, unless otherwise approved by the state department of environmental protection; 
(b)  All buildings shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with section 165.05(B)(5)(h); 
(c)  All buildings or structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns; 
(d)  All pile and column foundations and structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values shall equal or exceed the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design-specifications and plans for construction are incompliance with the provisions contained in section 165.05(B)(5)(b), (c) and (d). 
(f)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction, prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects or wave deflection. The town building official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect and/or soil scientist which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
(i)  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
(ii)  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
(iii)  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(g)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage; 
(h)  Lattice work or decorative screening shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway under abnormally high tides or wave action without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used and provided the following design specifications are met: 
(i)  No solid walls shall be allowed; and 
(ii)  Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only. 
(i)  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, such enclosed space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises; 
(j)  Prior to construction, plans for any buildings that will have lattice work or decorative screening must be submitted to the town building official for approval; and 
(k)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with lattice work or decorative screening, as provided for in section 165.05(B)(5)(h) and (i). 
(C)  Standards for streams without established flood elevation and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 165.03(B), where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principals; and 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 165.04(C)(11). 
(D)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) which are greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres. 
(E)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 165.03(B) are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings shall: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.

(C)  Consideration by council. 
(1)  Board report. No preliminary plans shall be considered for action by the council until they have been reviewed by and recommendations made by the planning, zoning and variance board. The council will consider the board's recommendations and then act for preliminary approval, postponement or disapproval. Disapproved plans may be revised and resubmitted to the board. 
(2)  Review criteria. The council, in studying the preliminary plat, will take into consideration the requirements of the community and the best use of the land being subdivided. Particular attention will be given to the width, arrangement and location of streets, lot sizes and arrangement, as well as requirements for school sites, public building sites, parkways and highways. Adequate street connections will be required to ensure free access to, and circulation for, adjoining subdivisions and lands. 
(3)  Waivers. In cases where the proposed subdivision plat is a re-subdivision of portions of an existing subdivision or a plat in connection with abandonment of a portion of existing public streets and property, on or nearby property which unduly affects the planning and development of the subject property, the council shall have the right to vary the strict application of this chapter in appropriate cases in a manner so as to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter. 
(4)  Public hearings. At a scheduled meeting the council shall receive reports on the preliminary plat to determine its conformance to this chapter. The subdivider and any other persons shall have the right to be heard by the council, either in person or by letter. 
(5)  Council action. The council may approve the preliminary plat if found to be in conformance with this chapter or may disapprove the plat when not found to be in conformance. Any modifications requested by the council must be made to the preliminary plat before approval thereof. Approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute tentative council approval of the subdivision as to the character and intensity of development, the general layout and the approximate dimensions of streets, lots and other proposed features. 
(6)  Effect of approval. The following limitations are placed on the preliminary plat approvals given by the council: 
(a)  The approval of the council shall have full force and effect for a period of 12 months from the date of approval. An extension may be granted by the board; 
(b)  If no final plat has been filed for the area covered by the preliminary plat before the approval period has elapsed, the approval shall be deemed revoked. If final plats are filed for only a portion of the preliminary plat, the approval on the remaining portions shall be deemed revoked unless an extension of time has been granted by the council; and 
(c)  If a final plat is submitted on which changes have been made from the preliminary approval, the town building official shall review the plat to determine the changes and their effect on the area of the plat and the applicable ordinances. The town building official shall determine whether any changes are of so great a significance that they would be resubmitted to the planning, zoning and variance board. In any case of doubt, the plan should be resubmitted for approval by the board.

(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 166.14. - Improvements. 
    By the presentation of the final plat for approval and recording, the subdivider thereby agrees to maintain in good condition all improvements required to be placed on the land pursuant to this chapter for a period of one year from the date the plat is recorded or the performance bond is released, whichever is later. To maintain in good condition means that at the end of the period mentioned, the improvements shall be in a condition so that they meet the requirements of this chapter as it existed at the time of final approval of the plat. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Chapter 167 - ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 

Sec. 167.01. - Wetlands. 
(A)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Whereas, pursuant to F.S. ch. 373, wetlands and surface waters are protected because they often serve as spawning, nursery and feeding habitats for many species such as fish and wildlife; and because they often provide important flood storage, detrital production, nutrient cycling, navigation and recreation and water quality functions; 
(2)  Whereas, a wide array of biological, physical and chemical factors affect the functions of wetlands and surface water systems such as streams, rivers and estuaries, the State of Florida has declared the maintenance of water quality standards in wetlands and other surface water systems to be critical in sustaining their many functions; 
(3)  Whereas, the State of Florida has declared the Indian River Lagoon as a priority water body in need of restoration and special protection, and has established a goal to attain and maintain the water and sediment quality needed to support a macrophyte-based (seagrass) system, endangered and threatened species, fisheries and recreation in the lagoon; 
(4)  Whereas, protection of littoral and wetland vegetation along the Indian River Lagoon shoreline prevents soil erosion, reduces turbidity levels detrimental to water quality and protects life and property from potential flood waters; and 
(5)  Whereas, protection and maintenance of wetlands in Indian River Shores supports federal and state goals to achieve no net loss of wetlands as well as to create and restore wetlands to increase the quantity and quality of the wetland resource base. 
(6)  Therefore, the town shall work in concert with state and federal regulatory agencies having jurisdiction to implement protection standards that preserve wetlands and associated adjacent uplands; and when a state agency having jurisdiction deems mitigation appropriate for compensating a project impact, the town shall coordinate with the state agency to assure that the overall mitigation complies with the "no net loss" state policy. 
(B)  Definitions and abbreviations.

(a)  Investigation and wetland boundary determinations: 
(i)  The town building official shall forward all applications for rezoning and/or development potentially impacting a wetland to the town manager. Upon receipt of the applicant's technical data, the town manager or designee shall review the development pursuant to the town's Land Development Code, including wetland boundaries and wetland impacts and coordinate the same with the applicant. The applicant shall ensure that SJRWMD communications regarding wetland delineation and impact assessment are delivered to the town expeditiously in order to facilitate the resolution of issues impacting field investigations, wetland boundary delineations and wetland impacts, including wetland buffers and planned upland improvements. The intent is that the analysis of wetlands by the town and the SJRWMD occur concurrently and that the town review the findings of the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) and any other agencies having jurisdiction and coordinate issues of mutual concern. 
(ii)  The town manager or designee shall coordinate resolution of wetland issues with other public agencies having jurisdiction in the impacted area in order to resolve issues surrounding disputed boundaries as well as any disputed results of wetland assessments, needed site plan or preliminary plat revisions, and potential mitigation strategies. The town staff shall incorporate recommendations of the town and the SJRWMD regarding any such issues into its technical development review and submit the same to the planning, zoning and variance board. The town council shall render final decisions on site plans, including wetland issues, based on recommendation of the planning, zoning and variance board and consideration of technical findings. 
(b)  Wetland management determinations and development stipulations: 
(i)  Technical report and coordination with agencies having jurisdiction. The town manager or designee shall coordinate technical issues concerning wetland development petitions or requests for exceptions based on information provided by the applicant, public agencies having jurisdiction over the wetlands and findings and recommendations of the town's consultant as appropriate. Where a proposed land use or development activity is deemed appropriate, the technical report shall stipulate recommended conditions necessary to preserve the function of wetlands. Such stipulated conditions shall be predicated on consideration of the developer's application and supportive technical analysis and shall reflect the consideration of performance standards and criteria cited in this chapter. 
(ii)  Conditions and limitations. The town council may place conditions on any exception or development approval as herein provided including, but not limited to, required mitigation and the dedication of a conservation easement to the town in order to assure that wetlands are perpetually preserved and conserved. Wetlands shall be subject to all applicable land development regulations of the federal and state permitting agencies as well as regulations contained in the town of Indian River Shores Comprehensive Plan and Code of Ordinances. 
(iii)  Disputes, appeals and reconciliation. The applicant shall submit a copy of the SJRWMD letter of determination within ten days of its issuance. Upon the town's receipt of the state's formal wetland delineation and impact assessment, including any proposed mitigation strategy, the town council will accept or appeal the state agency's formal wetland delineation determination, site plan assessment and mitigation strategy, if any. If the town council appeals the state agency's formal determination, the basis for the appeal shall be based on the review and written comment submitted by the town's environmental expert, who shall be a professional environmental engineer, limnologist, soil scientist or biologist with demonstrated experience in protecting the physical and biological functions of wetlands from potential adverse impacts of development. 
Upon the town council's decision to appeal a formal wetland delineation impact assessment, including any proposed mitigation strategy occurring pursuant to section 167.01(I)(3) herein, the town manager shall submit a written appeal to the state agency in the time prescribed by law. Review of a development order or permit application for property containing or abutting wetlands shall not commence until conclusion of the appeal process. 
(D)  Wetlands development restricted and buffer required. Development in or on wetlands is prohibited except for projects compliant with the provisions of this section 167.01, including compliance with permitting requirements of state and federal agencies having jurisdiction, which shall be demonstrated by duly issued permits from such agencies. The town shall require that tidal wetlands be protected by requiring upland buffers with a minimum width of 25 feet. The town may require an increase in such specifications on a case by case basis if, after considering recommendations of the town staff and/or biologist, hydrologist, soil scientist or other similar environmental expert knowledgeable in coastal wetland ecosystems and associated hydrology, the town council determines that an increased buffer is required to protect a particular habitat, wetland and/or water resources against potential adverse impacts. 
(1)  Wetland density transfers. The town comprehensive plan assigns a density of one unit per five acres to wetlands whose location and extent are determined and confirmed by a state agency. Density may be transferred from a wetland ("sending area") to a contiguous upland under unity of title ("receiving area"). The upland "receiving area" shall not be separated from the wetland "sending area" by submerged land, public land (including rights-of-way) or any other land that is not under unity of title. No density credits shall be assigned to submerged land. The maximum density within the receiving upland shall not exceed one and a half times the density delineated on the future land use map. A proposed plan involving any density transfer shall demonstrate compatibility with development within 200 feet of the perimeter of the subject site; shall be compliant with all applicable rules and regulations of the federal government, state and the town including, but not limited to, site plan review considerations, availability of infrastructure and preservation of adjacent environmentally sensitive areas; and shall require approval as a conditional use including compliance with conditional use criteria stated herein. 
(2)  Character of wetland buffer; conservation easement. Buffers shall remain in an undisturbed condition, except for drainage features such as spreader swales and discharge structures, provided the construction or use of these features does not adversely impact wetlands. Existing vegetation within the upland buffer shall be preserved and no turf or ornamental grass species shall be allowed. Within required vegetative buffers any exotic species as specified in section 163.04(D) shall be removed and replaced with native ground and understory species and native trees species approved by the town council. A vegetated berm, swale or other approved run-off control device shall be installed on the upland side of the buffer. No impervious surface shall be permitted therein. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, a conservation easement shall be submitted to the town and recorded with the clerk of the circuit court for all remaining wetland areas within the subject lot. 
(3)  Exemptions. The following are exempt from the provisions of section 167.01: 
(a)  Any development, construction or use initiated according to any valid building permit or site plan development order issued or approved by the town prior to the original effective date of this ordinance;

(F)  Town review of development plans. As part of the development review process during review of the preliminary plat or site plan as appropriate, the town shall coordinate its review of development adjacent to the Indian River Lagoon and/or wetlands with state and federal agencies having jurisdiction over development impacts to wetlands, including the submerged land, habitat and surface waters, including the SJRWMD, DEP and the FFWCC. The common objective shall be to protect and conserve the beneficial functions of these resources. At the time an applicant submits an application for permit approval by a state or federal agency having jurisdiction over a proposed development impacting wetlands, habitat, surface water management systems or submerged lands within the town limits, the applicant shall concurrently file a copy of such application, including all supportive narrative and graphic information, with the town manager. The applicant shall submit to the town manager all subsequent updates and/or revisions to applications as well as documents pertaining to predispositions, conditions and actions of the agencies having jurisdiction. 
(G)  Procedure for evaluating permit applications. The procedure for evaluating development with potential wetland impacts commences with a determination of whether the proposed development yields no net adverse impacts to wetlands, habitat and water quality. Secondly, if the development is found to have adverse wetland impacts a determination shall be made regarding whether the adverse impacts to the wetland system, water quality, unique habitats and other factors surrounding the public interest can be eliminated or reduced by revisions to the applicant's plans. Thirdly, if any adverse impacts which remain after practicable design modifications have been made, the adverse impacts must be mitigated. 
(H)  Criteria applied in determining "no net adverse impacts." As part of the development review process, during review of the preliminary plat or site plan as appropriate, the applicant shall provide reasonable assurances that the proposed development will not impact the values of wetland and other surface water functions so as to cause adverse impacts to fish, wildlife and listed species, including their abundance, diversity and their habitat. Where habitats for listed species are present, the applicant may be required to provide a wildlife survey of listed species and provide information regarding site characteristics, the range and habitat needs of listed species potentially impacted, and whether the proposed development will adversely impact the listed species, including their habitat. Survey methodologies employed to inventory the site must provide reasonable assurances regarding the presence or absence of the subject listed species. When assessing the value of functions that any wetland or other surface water provides to fish, wildlife and listed species, the applicant shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  Condition. Whether the wetland or other surface water is in a high quality state or has been the subject of past alterations in hydrology, water quality or vegetative composition; 
(2)  Hydrologic connection. The nature and degree of offsite connection that may benefit off-site water resources through detrital export, base flow maintenance, water quality enhancement or the provision of nursery habitat; 
(3)  Location and uniqueness. The location and relative rarity of the wetland or other surface water and its floral and faunal components in relation to the surrounding regional landscape; 
(4)  Fish and wildlife utilization. Use of the wetland for resting, feeding, breeding, nesting or denning by fish and wildlife, particularly those which are listed species; and 
(5)  Water quantity impacts on established hydroperiod. The applicant must provide reasonable assurance that the development will not change the hydroperiod of a wetland and water resources so as to adversely affect wetland functions or other surface water functions to include the following as applicable: 
(a)  Whenever portions of a system, such as constructed basins, structures, stormwater ponds, canals, and ditches, could have the effect of reducing the depth, duration or frequency of inundation or saturation in a wetland or other surface water, the applicant must perform an analysis of the drawdown in water levels or diversion of water flows resulting from such activities and provide reasonable assurance that these drawdowns or diversions will not adversely impact the functions that wetlands and other surface waters provide to fish and wildlife and listed species. 
(b)  Increasing the depth, duration or frequency of inundation through changing the rate or method of discharge of water to wetlands or other surface waters or by impounding water in wetlands or other surface waters must also be addressed to prevent adverse effects to functions that wetlands and other surface waters provide to fish and wildlife and listed species. Different types of wetlands respond differently to increased depth, duration or frequency of inundation. Therefore, the applicant must provide reasonable assurance that activities that have the potential to increase discharge or water levels will not adversely affect the functioning of the specific wetland or other surface water subject to the increased discharge or water level. 
(c)  Whenever portions of a system could have the effect of altering water levels in wetlands or other surface waters, applicants shall be required to monitor the wetland or other surface waters to demonstrate that such alteration has not resulted in adverse impacts; or calibrate the system to prevent adverse impacts. Monitoring parameters, methods, schedules and reporting requirements shall be specified in permit conditions. 
(6)  Public interest considerations. If the development is anticipated to significantly degrade, the applicant must provide assurances that the activity is clearly in the public interest by demonstrating that the positive impacts significantly outweigh the negative impacts, including: 
(a)  Whether the development will adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare or the property of others; 
(b)  Whether the development will adversely affect the conservation of fish and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species, or their habitats; 
(c)  Whether the development will adversely affect navigation or flow of water or cause harmful erosion or shoaling; 
(d)  Whether the development will adversely affect the fishing or recreational values or marine productivity in the vicinity of the activity; 
(e)  Whether the development will be of a temporary or permanent nature; 
(f)  Whether the development will adversely affect or will enhance significant historical and archaeological resources; and 
(g)  The current condition and relative value of functions being performed by areas affected by the proposed development. 
(7)  Evaluate impacts to quality of receiving waters. The applicant must provide assurances that the short and long term impacts of the proposed development will not adversely affect the quality of receiving waters and demonstrate compliance with applicable state water quality standards. Reasonable assurances regarding water quality must be provided both for the short term and the long term, addressing the proposed construction, alteration, operation, maintenance, removal and abandonment of the system. 
(8)  Assess secondary impacts to water resources. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed development will not cause adverse secondary impacts to the water resources. The town may require above minimum standard buffers in order to ensure that secondary impacts to the habitat functions of wetlands are protected, especially habitat for listed species. 
(9)  Consider cumulative impacts. A development shall not cause unacceptable cumulative impacts upon wetlands and other surface waters. Cumulative impacts are considered unacceptable when the proposed development, considered in conjunction with the past, present and future development activities, is anticipated to result in a violation of state water quality standards or cause significant adverse impacts to functions of wetlands and water resources. 
(I)  Uniform mitigation methodology. If adverse wetland impacts cannot be eliminated by adjustments to the plan, the adverse wetland impacts must be appropriately mitigated. Standards to determine the amount of mitigation needed to offset adverse impacts to wetlands shall follow the uniform mitigation assessment method established in Florida Statutes and Florida Administrative Codes. Applicants are encouraged to consult with SJRWMD staff in pre-application conferences and involve the town manager or designee to identify appropriate mitigation options. The town shall require that any off-site mitigation occurs within the town's municipal limits unless the applicant in concert with the district demonstrates to the town's satisfaction that no combination of sites meeting the state mitigation requirements exist within the town. In the latter case, the town's preference shall be that the mitigation occur on a site within Indian River County that lies within the town's regional watershed and that such off-site mitigation would improve and/or protect water quality of the Indian River and meet district mitigation requirements. 
(1)  Wetland mitigation assessment. Any property owner, developer or entity proposing to adversely impact a wetland (hereinafter "applicant") shall prepare a wetland mitigation assessment report. The report shall be prepared in written and illustrative form and shall comply with the state's uniform mitigation assessment methodology as set forth in Florida Statutes and Florida Administrative Codes. If the proposed mitigation site is not located within the town, the applicant must provide written documentation demonstrating why a mitigation site located within the town limits could not be obtained. 
(2)  Use of experts for wetland assessment. Wetland mitigation assessments shall be performed by a professional specializing in biology, hydrology, soil science or related environmental expert knowledgeable in coastal wetland ecosystems and associated hydrology. A development applicant or property owner is responsible for retaining an environmental expert at the applicant's own expense to perform the required wetland mitigation assessment. 
(3)  Review of wetland mitigation assessment . The wetland mitigation assessment report shall be submitted to the town manager. The town shall retain the services of a professional biologist, hydrologist, soil scientist or other similar environmental expert knowledgeable in coastal wetland ecosystems and associated hydrology (hereinafter "environmental expert"). Upon review of the wetland mitigation assessment report for consistency and compliance with the state's uniform mitigation assessment methodology, the town's environmental expert shall prepare and submit written recommendations to the town manager recommending that the town council deny, accept or accept with conditions appropriate wetland mitigation. The cost to the town for the services of its environmental expert shall be borne by the applicant. Prior to the hiring of the environmental expert, the town manager may require a deposit from the applicant to pay for the services of the environmental expert. 
(4)  Reconciliation and consistency with state agency wetland mitigation requirements. If the state agency requires a greater amount of mitigation than that required by the town, the amount required by state agency shall apply. If mitigation requirements imposed by the town for wetland impacts of an activity regulated under this section 167.01 cannot be reconciled with mitigation requirements approved under a permit for the same activity issued by the state agency, the state agency mitigation requirements shall be followed. 
(5)  Monitoring requirements for mitigation areas. Applicants shall monitor the progress of mitigation areas until success can be demonstrated. Mitigation success will be measured in terms of whether the objectives of the mitigation can be realized. The success criteria to be included in permit conditions will specify the minimum requirements necessary to attain a determination of success. The mitigation shall be deemed successful when all applicable water quality standards are met, the mitigation area has achieved viable and sustainable ecological and hydrological functions and the specific success criteria contained in the permit are met. If success is not achieved within the time frame specified within the permit, remedial measures shall be required. Monitoring and maintenance requirements shall remain in effect until success is achieved. 
(J)  Permitted uses in wetlands. The uses identified below shall be permitted within tidal or non-tidal wetlands denoted on a duly approved site plan; however, all physical improvement must have been included in the approved site plan submitted pursuant to chapter 168 of the town's Land Development Code, regardless of the zoning district. In addition, the application shall demonstrate compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. Zoning district provisions shall govern permitted uses on converted uplands denoted on a duly approved site plan, including receipt of required permit approvals by other agencies having jurisdiction over wetland issues. These federal, state and local approvals must be granted before any site work begins: 
(1)  Passive recreation; 
(2)  Elevated boardwalks (non-covered) used to reach duly approved boat docks within the Indian River Lagoon or its tributaries, provided that such boardwalks shall not be wider than four feet; 
(3)  Open space; 
(4)  Restricted access ways for essential public service; 
(5)  Bird sanctuary; and 
(6)  Accessory uses to the above. 
(K)  Conditional uses. Any development having a potential impact on wetlands shall require conditional use approval, including compliance with conditional use criteria stated herein. Conditional use review procedures shall be the same as for site plan review. A proposed conditional use must demonstrate compliance with the following conditional use criteria which shall be applied by the town to determine whether a proposed conditional use is suitable for the site and whether it is appropriately designed to avoid potential land use incompatibility as well as potential adverse impacts. The criteria shall be used to achieve smooth transition in land use including density, intensity, appearance, size, height, mass and design amenities. The intent is to ensure that conditional uses shall only be permitted on specific sites where the proposed use may be adequately accommodated without generating adverse impacts on properties and land uses within the immediate vicinity. The use must be compatible with the character of the surrounding area. The specific site shall have sufficient land area to accommodate the proposed type of use including its scale, mass, density and/or intensity, as well as requisite project amenities, infrastructure, parking and internal vehicular and pedestrian circulation; provide adequate screening and buffering; and avoid or successfully mitigate adverse environmental conditions, nuisance impacts and other adverse impacts. A proposed conditional use shall only be considered if a site plan is submitted and is demonstrated to comply with site plan review criteria established in chapter 168 of the town's Land Development Code, "Development Review Procedures," as with chapter 166 of the town's Land Development Code, "Subdivisions," if subdivision of land is proposed. All conditional uses shall be reviewed based on criteria established herein and within respective zoning districts. The use must be found to comply with the following: 
(1)  Traffic generation and access. Traffic generation and access for the proposed use shall not adversely impact adjoining properties and the general public safety and shall meet concurrency management level of service standards; 
(2)  Off-street parking, loading and service areas. Off-street parking, loading and service areas shall meet zoning district standards and shall be landscaped and buffered based on standards of the town's Land Development Code; 
(3)  Required yards, screening or buffering and landscaping. Required yards, screening or buffering and landscaping shall be consistent with the district regulations, and the town shall reserve the right to require more restrictive buffers and landscaping to mitigate potential adverse impacts. If the town determines that buffers and landscaping cannot mitigate the potential adverse impacts, the conditional use shall be denied; 
(4)  Architecture and signage. The character of architectural and signage improvements shall have a unified theme and shall incorporate decorative features and harmonious colors and scale; 
(5)  Size, location or number of conditional uses. Size, location or number of conditional uses in an area shall be limited so as to maintain the overall character of the district in which said conditional uses are located; 
(6)  Factors impacting scale and intensity of conditional uses. The size and shape of the site, the proposed access and internal circulation and the urban design enhancements must be determined by the town to be adequate to accommodate the proposed scale and intensity of conditional use requested. The site shall be of sufficient size to accommodate urban design amenities such as screening, buffers, landscaping, open space, off-street parking, efficient internal traffic circulation, infrastructure and similar site plan improvements needed to mitigate potential adverse impacts of the proposed use including its design, mass, height and scale; 
(7)  Avoid adverse impacts to adjacent land uses. The applicant shall demonstrate that the conditional use shall incorporate mitigative techniques needed to prevent adverse impacts to adjacent land uses and public facilities; 
(8)  Compatibility.

(5)  Violate or fail to observe any of the requirements or provisions set forth herein pertaining to the protection of dune and shoreline vegetation. 
(D)  Exemptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the following activities shall be lawful without application for, or issuance of, a tree removal or land clearing permit. None of these exemptions shall apply to any mangrove; nor shall they apply to dune vegetation. Burden of proving entitlement to any particular exemption shall lie with the person claiming use of the exemption in the event the exempted activity ever becomes subject to an enforcement proceeding. 
(1)  Limited pruning (excluding mangroves). This includes the limited pruning and trimming of any tree or other vegetation as necessary for the clearing of a path not to exceed four feet in width to provide physical access or view necessary to conduct a survey or site examination for the preparation of subdivision plats, site plans or tree surveys, provided the clearing or removal is conducted under the direction of a state registered surveyor or engineer. 
(2)  Restricted landscape maintenance. This includes routine landscape maintenance such as trimming or pruning of vegetation which is not intended to result in the eventual death of a plant, mowing of yards or lawns or any other landscaping or gardening activity which is commonly recognized as routine maintenance or replacement. This exemption shall be construed to allow routine maintenance of dune vegetation growing seaward of the coastal construction control line, provided the person owning the property, or his agent, first provides sufficient documentation evidencing express permission for such activity from the bureau of beaches and coastal systems of the department of environmental protection of the state. 
(3)  Work by utility service. This includes the removal, trimming, pruning or alteration of any tree or vegetation in an existing utility easement or right-of-way provided the work is done by or under the control of the operating utility company and the company has received all necessary licenses or permits to provide utility service within the easement. 
(4)  Minor alteration to preserve existing access. This includes the removal, pruning, trimming or alteration of any tree or vegetation for the purpose of maintaining an existing access to a property with minimum necessary alteration to natural vegetation. 
(5)  Damaged trees. Any tree which has been destroyed or damaged beyond saving by natural causes or causes not covered by other sections of this chapter, or which constitutes an immediate peril to life, property or other trees, may be removed without a permit. 
(E)  Permits. The following permits with stated limitations shall be available upon proper application to the tree protection officer and compliance with this chapter: 
(1)  Tree removal permit. A tree removal permit shall not authorize the destruction of a mangrove unless the criteria governing mangrove alteration is satisfied; 
(2)  Land clearing permit. A land clearing permit does not authorize the removal or destruction of protected trees, nor does it authorize any alteration to a mangrove; and 
(3)  Mangrove alteration permit. No mangrove shall be altered unless the tree protection officer has issued appropriate permits based on a determination that all criteria governing both tree removal and mangrove alteration permits has been satisfied. 
(F)  Criteria for issuing permits. The following criteria shall be satisfied prior to issuance of a tree removal, mangrove alteration, or land clearing permit respectively: 
(1)  Retaining native plant materials. In any case, at least 25 percent of any native plant community shall be retained on a lot except for new development where 15 percent may be retained if another 20 percent of native canopy is planted, and any regionally endangered species is preserved; 
(2)  Tree removal permit criteria. In determining whether or not a permit required by this chapter should be issued, the tree protection officer shall consider the following criteria: 
(a)  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, insect attack, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with utilities services; 
(b)  The necessity of removing a tree to construct proposed improvements in order to allow reasonable economic use of the property; 
(c)  The topography of the land where the tree is located and the effect removal of the tree would have on erosion, soil moisture retention, increased or decreased flow or diversion in the flow of surface waters and the impact on overall surface water management; 
(d)  The number and density of trees existing on-site; 
(e)  The relative significance or uniqueness of the tree as a historic or specimen tree; 
(f)  The impact on the natural environment including ground and surface water stabilization, water quality and aquifer recharge, ecological impacts, noise buffer, air quality and wildlife habitat; 
(g)  The ease with which the proposed development or improvement can be accomplished while accommodating existing mangrove or trees; and 
(h)  The economic hardship which would be imposed upon the applicant should the permit not be granted. 
    If during the review process the tree protection officer determines any tree to be a tree of special concern as defined in this chapter, then a tree permit shall not be issued if the tree is found to be outside the approved building structures perimeter or in an area in which a swimming pool, spa, deck, driveway, roadway, detached building or other approved construction is located or is to be located (hereinafter referenced as the "building area"). In the event the tree of special concern is located inside the building area, then the request for the issuance of the tree removal permit shall be submitted to the planning, zoning and variance board to determine whether the permit should be granted. The planning, zoning and variance board shall determine whether the location of any improvement can be reasonably made without the necessity of removing the tree of special concern. If a reasonable alternative exists to adjust the building area, then the permit may be denied. 
(3)  Mangrove alteration permit. In determining whether or not to issue a permit to alter a mangrove, the tree protection officer shall consider not only tree removal criteria above, but shall also consider the following criteria and incorporate them as conditions of the permit if issued. A violation of any of these provisions shall be deemed to be unlawful and subject to all penalties provided for herein. 
(a)  At least 50 percent of the original canopy of any mangrove trees shall be continuously retained. 
(b)  White mangroves and buttonwood shall not be trimmed at all at a distance less than three feet above the natural ground elevation. 
(c)  On red mangroves, no prop roots shall be damaged, removed or buried by fill or other means. 
(d)  Red mangroves may be hedged down to a minimum height of six feet, providing the limitations in (a) and (g) of this subsection are not exceeded. Notwithstanding, juvenile red mangroves may be hedged down to a minimum height of three feet, providing the limitations in (g) of this subsection are not exceeded. 
(e)  On a black mangrove of ten feet or less in height, there shall be no cutting or trimming below the lowest two living lateral limbs, unless a significant canopy area is left at the top of the tree. Further, no pneumatophores shall be damaged or removed nor shall they be buried by fill or other means. 
(f)  No large mangrove cuttings shall be discarded into any estuary, marsh, river or adjacent water course. 
(g)  Pruning, removal and relocation of mangroves shall be prohibited between December 1 and February 15. 
(h)  All cuts shall be made cleanly and at the base of the branch or limb cut, except when done with respect to the shaping of a hedge. 
(i)  A mangrove alteration permit shall not authorize removal of any mangrove unless the applicant replaces or relocates that number of mangroves necessary to re-vegetate an area approximately equal to the area destroyed on the same development site. The applicant must provide an affirmative program satisfactory to the tree protection officer to assure survival of the replaced or relocated mangroves and to stabilize the shoreline from which mangroves were removed. The approved program shall be considered an express condition of the permit. 
(j)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, vegetative changes due to mosquito control activities undertaken as part of a governmental mosquito control program shall not be considered an ordinance violation. 
(k)  Where mangrove alteration, removal and/or replacement permits are requested as part of a program to dredge or fill a mosquito impoundment area, the town may mandate partial restoration and/or replacement of mangroves and/or estuarine plants in order to stabilize shorelines in the impacted area. The town shall assure that related dredge and fill activities provide for and/or preserve a continuance in the circulation and flushing action of waters impacting wetlands. To this end, dredge and fill activities surrounding mangrove alteration shall not create isolated wetlands. 
(4)  Replanting and hedging program. Notwithstanding the criteria of (F)(2) above, the property owner/applicant may elect a replanting and hedging program under the direction and control of the tree protection officer and under which juvenile mangroves may be hedged several times each year and maintained at a height after periodic hedging of three feet without a permit. Such routine hedging shall be restricted to the new growth on mangrove hedges not exceeding 18 inches in height. If new growth is allowed to exceed 18 inches, subsequent trimming shall require a permit. As a mandatory and integral part of any routine hedging of mangroves, hedged material (clippings) shall be left atop the hedged mangroves until leaf drop from the hedge material (clippings) has occurred. The dropped leaves shall then become part of the estuary food chain. 
(5)  Land clearing permit. In determining whether or not to issue a permit to clear or grub land as required by this chapter, the tree protection officer shall consider whether the applicant has or is complying with all tree and land clearing provisions of this chapter and shall base a decision regarding issuance of a permit on the following criteria: 
(a)  The minimum necessary vegetation removal on the property for purposes of land surveying or land preparation for development or other economic uses; 
(b)  Whether visual access is necessary to comply with the tree survey requirements herein; 
(c)  Whether the applicant provided barriers around all protected trees on the site or will use light machinery that does not penetrate or severely compact the soil for clearing protected area understory vegetation; and 
(d)  The impact upon natural and manmade systems including erosion and surface water management and other impacts identified in (F)(2) above. 
(e)  To this end the applicant shall provide a reasonable written plan for controlling erosion which may be expected to occur as a result of the proposed clearing or grubbing as follows: 
(i)  The plan shall incorporate some or all of the following measures necessary to achieve soil stabilization, prevent erosion and promote efficient surface water management, including temporary seeding and mulching, sodding, diversion berms, interceptor ditches, sediment barriers, sediment basins and related appurtenances or devices; and 
(ii)  All provisions of an erosion control plan shall be incorporated as express conditions of the land clearing permit issued and a violation of any of the conditions or provisions of the plan shall be considered a violation of this chapter, and subject to all enforcement provisions. 
(G)  Approval or denial of permit. 
(1)  LDC compliance prior to issuance of permit. The tree protection officer shall only issue a tree removal, mangrove alteration or land clearing permit upon a finding that all applicable requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. No permit shall be granted if the tree protection officer determines that any one of the following conditions exists: 
(a)  Ability to reasonably shift location of proposed improvements. The applicant can reasonably shift the location of the structure, building or improvement which he wishes to construct on the site while maintaining the existence of the subject trees or mangroves and still permitting the construction of the building or improvement on the site; 
(b)  Ability to reasonably modify design concept. The applicant can reasonably modify the design of a structure, building or other improvement which he wishes to construct on the site while maintaining the existence of the trees or mangroves proposed to be removed and still permit construction of a substantially similar building on the site; or 
(c)  Land clearing or removal generates substantial adverse impact. The land clearing or the removal of the subject trees or mangroves will have a substantial adverse impact on the urban and natural environment. 
(2)  Permit denial. If the tree protection officer denies the removal permit, he or she shall set forth with particularity his reasons for the denial in writing. 
(3)  Visible permit maintained on site. A copy of all permits issued pursuant to this chapter shall be maintained on site. Such permits shall be made visible on site for inspection and shall be contained within a protective cover. 
(H)  Replacement or relocation of trees. As a condition to granting a permit, the applicant shall be required to relocate or replace a tree being removed at the applicant's expense. The specifications regulating the replacement of trees are cited below: 
(1)  Characteristics of replacement trees. The replacement tree or trees shall have at least equal shade potential, screening properties or other characteristics comparable to that of the tree or trees requested to be removed. 
(2)  Size of replacement trees. The replacement tree or trees are to be made according to a standard of one inch diameter at breast height (DBH) total replacement for each one inch DBH removed, unless otherwise agreed upon by both the tree protection officer and the applicant. Any number of trees may be utilized to meet the inch-for-inch requirement provided acceptable spacing and design are maintained. 
(3)  Tree species. Relocated or replacement trees shall include only species defined as protected trees under this chapter. 
(4)  Minimum standards for replacement trees. All replacements must have a minimum overall planted height of 12 feet, four inch caliper at the time of planting, 25 feet apart, Grade "A" or better. 
(5)  Transplanting and maintenance requirements. All trees transplanted pursuant to this chapter shall be maintained in a healthy, living condition. Any trees which die shall be replaced by the applicant. The tree protection officer shall retain jurisdiction to insure compliance with this section. 
(6)  Waivers of replacement tree specifications. 
(a)  The tree protection officer may waive the size or minimum standards specifications if the applicant can demonstrate that the current market conditions are such that replacement tree or trees meeting these specifications are not readily available. 
(b)  Similarly, the number of required replacements may be waived by the tree protection officer if the tree protection officer determines that the remaining numbers of trees to be preserved on-site are of sufficient number and quality to substantially comply with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(c)  Substitute trees allowed under this waiver provision must have the approval of the tree protection officer. 
(I)  Information required for application. Application for issuance of any permit required by this section shall be made in writing to the town building official on a form provided by the town. The form shall request all information necessary to evaluate a particular application including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  A statement as to the applicant's interest in the property and reasonable proof of ownership; 
(2)  A legal description of the property and a boundary survey or accurate scaled drawing thereof; 
(3)  A tree survey indicating all trees and including those trees that are intended for removal, relocation or alteration in any way and those which will be left undisturbed. A written explanation shall be included with the tree survey identifying those criteria in section 167.02(E) through (H) which justify issuance of the requested permit; and 
(4)  If land clearing is intended, an erosion control plan as described in section 167.02(F), together with reasons for clearing or grubbing of the site. 
The application shall be submitted and processed concurrently with site plan or subdivision approval, as the case may be, when the approvals are otherwise required to make use of the property. The site plan or subdivision preliminary plat shall be prepared in a manner to allow ready comparison with the tree survey to assess whether the cited criteria have been met. All items shown shall be properly dimensioned, scaled and referenced to the property lines, easements and setback or yard requirements. If known, existing and proposed site elevations and major contours shall be included. An administrative fee to offset the cost of evaluating the application shall be collected in an amount determined by resolution of the town council. A copy of the State Tree Protection Manual for builders and developers will be issued to each applicant for use as a guide to development. 
(J)  Inspection. The filing of an application shall be deemed to extend permission to the tree protection officer to inspect the subject property if necessary for purposes of evaluating the application. 
(K)  Period of review. 
(1)  For those applications which are not being processed concurrently with site plan or subdivision approval, the planning, zoning and variance board shall have 31 calendar days following receipt of a completed application within which to make a determination on whether a permit shall be issued as requested. 
(2)  If the permit is not issued, the board shall state in writing the reasons for denial and advise the applicant of any appeal remedies available. 
(3)  For good cause, the tree protection officer may request an extension, the period to be determined by the board, in which to make a determination, provided the extension is requested prior to expiration of the initial 31-day period. 
(L)  Permit expiration. 
(1)  Any permit issued hereunder shall remain valid for a term of 30 days and may be renewable for a second period of 30 days upon request to the tree protection officer. 
(2)  The tree protection officer may require reapplication and full review in those renewal cases where site conditions have changed substantially from the date of issuance of the initial permit as a result of natural growth of trees and vegetation or high winds, hurricane, tornado, flooding, fire or other act of God. 
(3)  If a permit required by this chapter has been issued concurrently with site plan or subdivision approval, then the permit shall run concurrently with the site plan or subdivision approval and shall be renewed together therewith. 
(M)  Tree trimming. The National Arborist Association standards for pruning, guying, fertilizing, lightning protection and spraying for shade and ornamental trees is hereby adopted by reference for the town as fully as if set out at length herein.

This light machinery shall not penetrate or severely compact the soil in clearing understory vegetation within protected areas whether or not protective barriers are in place. 
(4)  Marrings. Signs, building permits, wires or other attachments of any kind shall not be permitted to be attached to any protected tree. Guy wires designed to protect trees are excluded from this prohibition. 
(P)  Administration and enforcement. 
(1)  Local permit not exclusive. It is the intent of this chapter that permits or approvals required hereunder shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any federal, state, regional or other local approvals which may be required for the same or similar activities. Compliance with provisions of this chapter does not excuse any person for noncompliance with other applicable federal, state, regional or local laws. 
(2)  Variances and appeals. A variance from any of the substantive requirements of this section or an appeal of any administrative determination made by the tree protection officer may be obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in this code. The planning, zoning and variance board of the town shall be the board to which all variance requests or appeals are made. 
(Q)  Remedy. Any violation of this section is also subject to prosecution before the code enforcement board in accordance with applicable law and subject to penalties allowable under sections 30.80 through section 30.82 of the town Code of Ordinances. In addition to either of the foregoing remedies, the town or any aggrieved party having a substantial interest in the protections provided by this chapter may apply directly to a court of competent jurisdiction for mandatory or prohibited injunctive relief. In any enforcement proceeding, the adjudicating body may consider mitigating measures voluntarily undertaken by the alleged violator, such as replacement or relocation of trees or vegetation or other landscape improvements, in fashioning its remedy. The adjudicating body may also require such restorative measures. The violator shall be assessed any costs associated with administering the violation, including but not limited to contracted consultant fees as well as any public costs associated with improvements underlying required replacement and/or relocation of trees, vegetation or other landscaping improvements. If a landowner and/or other person or entity found in violation of this chapter fails to comply with mandated penalties, the town may deny issuing the subject violator any additional permits provided for in this chapter until the subject violator complies with assessments, penalties and any other corrective measures imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(R)  Penalty. A violation of any provision of this section shall be punishable upon conviction by a fine not to exceed $500.00, or by imprisonment in the county jail up to 60 days or both a fine and imprisonment. The destruction or alteration of each tree or plant under this section shall be considered a separate offense. The destruction of an historic or specimen tree, mangrove or any dune vegetation contrary to this chapter shall receive the maximum penalty provided by law.

Sec. 168.02. - Concurrency Management System (CMS). 
Sec. 168.02.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Concurrency is a finding that public facilities and services necessary to support a proposed development are available, or will be made available, concurrent with the impacts of the development. The CMS is intended to provide a systematic process for the review and evaluation of all proposed development for its impact on concurrency facilities and services as required by the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulations Act, F.S. chapter 163, Part II, and Rule 9J-5.0055, FAC. 
    Facilities in the town that are subject to these regulations include: 
(1)  Potable water; 
(2)  Recreation; 
(3)  Sanitary sewer; 
(4)  Public school facilities; 
(5)  Solid waste; 
(6)  Drainage; and 
(7)  Transportation. 
    The purpose of this CMS is to ensure that development orders and permits are conditioned on the availability of concurrency facilities and services that meet adopted level of service requirements identified in this CMS. The CMS is also intended to describe the requirements and procedures for determining consistency of proposed development with the town comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.2. - Consistency with town comprehensive plan. 
    All development applications shall demonstrate compliance with town comprehensive plan as well as with all applicable provisions of the town Land Development Code (LDC). Further, development applications shall demonstrate that specified concurrency facilities shall be available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development of those facilities. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.3. - Definition of concurrency management terms. 
    The following definitions shall apply to concurrency management rules and regulations: 
    Building permit. For purposes of the concurrency management ordinance, a duly issued permit that may authorize the construction of a new building, expansion of floor area, an increase in the number of dwelling units contained in an existing building or a change in use. 
    Capacity. Refers to the availability of a public service or facility to accommodate users expressed in an appropriate unit of measure, such as gallons per day or average daily trips. 
    Capacity, available. Capacity that can be reserved or committed to future users for a specific public facility. 
    Certificate of occupancy. A document issued by the town allowing the occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure or use has been constructed or may be used in compliance with all the applicable municipal codes and ordinances. 
    Concurrency facilities. Public facilities and services for which a level of service must be met concurrent with the impacts of development or an acceptable deadline as mandated in the comprehensive plan pursuant to F.S. ch. 163, and 9J-5.0055, FAC, shall include: 
(1)  Potable water; 
(2)  Recreation; 
(3)  Sanitary sewer; 
(4)  Public school facilities; 
(5)  Solid waste; 
(6)  Drainage; and 
(7)  Transportation. 
    Concurrency management system. The procedure and process that the town uses to ensure that no development order or building permit is issued by the town unless the necessary concurrency facilities are available or are assured to be available consistent with the town comprehensive plan. The procedure and process is also intended to ensure that sufficient capacity for concurrency facilities is available to meet and maintain adopted levels of service. As part of the CMS, the town shall operate and maintain a concurrency management monitoring system. 
    Concurrency status report. A status report prepared by the town identifying available concurrency facility capacity. The status report shall be produced, modified and adjusted from time-to-time as a result of the reservation of capacity or other act that alters the availability of concurrency facility capacity. 
    Design capacity. The potential or suitability for holding, storing or accommodating the demands upon a concurrency facility. 
    Developer's agreement. An agreement between the town and another party associated with the development of land, including but not limited to agreements associated with development orders. 
    Development order. Any order or permit granting, denying or granting with conditions an application for a preliminary or final development approval order, a final development order, a development permit or any other official action of the town which permits the development of land. 
    Development order, final. This shall mean the last discretionary act of the town before development can commence. The last discretionary act shall occur through an act of official authorization and with recorded documentation from the town thereby approving the final development plans for a proposed development project. The issuance of a final development order after the effective date of the ordinance adopting the comprehensive plan shall occur only if the site plan, design and construction plans and other prerequisite plans and conditions comply with the goals, objectives, and policies established in the comprehensive plan, the Land Development Code and the Building Code. Approval of a final subdivision plat by the town council shall not permit construction activity until a duly authorized building permit has been granted based on submittal of required building plans deemed by the town building official consistent with the town's Land Development Code and adopted Building Code. 
    A building permit shall be deemed a final development order. A certificate of occupancy may be deemed a final development order where an application for a proposed change of use for an existing structure is submitted which does not require any approval of buildings or other structures. All other development orders shall be deemed an initial development order since they do not (1) authorize construction for which a building permit is required or (2) authorize a change of use for which an initial or new certificate of occupancy (C.O.) is required. Final development orders shall include the town's final approval of the following development procedures: 
(1)  Final subdivision plat approved subsequent to the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan; 
(2)  Building permit; and 
(3)  Developments of Regional Impact (DRI) approval, where applicable. 
    Development order, preliminary. Any official action of the town or other public entity with duly authorized jurisdiction that has the effect of approving required plans with or without conditions prior to the issuance of a final development order (i.e., building permit) for construction on land located within the corporate limits of the town. A "preliminary development order" may document duly authorized approval of such requirements as amended comprehensive plan future land use map designations, rezonings, site plans, preliminary subdivision plans, final plats, concurrency determinations or other preliminary development approvals required by the town's Land Development Code prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
    Level of service. An indicator of the operational efficiency by a concurrency facility provider. 
    Level of service standard. The adopted volume of demand required for each concurrency facility to achieve acceptable operational efficiency. 
    Vested rights. A development order shall be deemed "vested" and not subject to requirements of concurrency management if development circumstances meet criteria for common law or statutory vesting as defined below. All "non-vested" development or development orders are subject to all requirements of this CMS. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.4. - General procedures and level of service standards. 
(A)  General CMS procedures purpose and intent. The concurrency management system (CMS) shall apply to all development activity in the town except development exempted pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180 and a one or two family house (on a lot in ownership separate from adjacent lots). Concurrency public facilities and services may be determined to be adequate to serve the needs of a proposed development after the applicant has demonstrated that traffic circulation, recreation, drainage, potable water, solid waste and sanitary sewer public facilities and services and public school facilities will be available to meet the established level of service standards for the proposed development consistent with F.S. ch. 163 and the concurrency management provisions of this chapter. All applicants for a concurrency determination shall be responsible for providing documentation signed by a duly authorized official of each concurrency facility service provider that identifies the provider's (1) estimated measure of demand generated by the proposed development (2) estimated measure of available capacity to meet the demand and (3) commitment to provide the needed services with or without stated conditions. Applicants for conditional concurrency determinations (see section 168.02.5(C)(2)) shall provide best available estimates from the service provider. Applicants for a final concurrency determination (see section 168.02.5(C)(3-4)) shall provide authorized final commitments to provide the service together with any conditions that may apply to the commitment. 
(B)  Level of service standards. New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service as established in the town comprehensive plan: 
(1)  Streets. "C" for all roads except "D" during peak tourist season. 
(2)  Sanitary sewers. Two hundred, fifty-five gallons per day per dwelling unit (113 gallons per capita per day). 2,500 gallons day per commercial acre (i.e. equivalent to 22 gallons per capita per acre per day). 
(3)  Solid waste. Twenty-one pounds per capita per week (or three pounds per capita per day). 
(4)  Drainage. 25-year, 24-hour design storm; post-development conditions shall not increase the amount or rate of run-off beyond predevelopment conditions. 
(5)  Potable water. Residential-450 gallons per dwelling unit per day (200 gallons per capita per day). Commercial-2,500 gallons per day per gross acre (i.e. equivalent to 22 gallons per capita per acre per day).

(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.5. - Applicability, exemptions and review procedures. 
(A)  Applicability of concurrency determinations. All preliminary and final development orders required to (1) construct a new building or residential unit (2) expand an existing use or (3) increase the intensity of a use, shall comply with concurrency management requirements of section 168.01, unless specifically exempted by Florida Statutes. No development order shall be approved unless an approved concurrency determination has been rendered or a determination is made that the development proposed is exempt from concurrency review. All redevelopment or additional development of previously improved lands shall be subject to a concurrency determination for the additional capacity needed to serve the net additional dwelling units as well as the net additional square footage of non-residential area. 
(B)  Exempt property. Determinations of exemption from concurrency review shall be made by the town manager or his designee. Exemptions may be based on vested rights determinations, application of de minimis criteria or determinations that there will be no increase in density or intensity. For school concurrency, also reference section 168.02.8(E)(2). Applications for single-family dwellings will be processed through the town's concurrency management system and exempted dwellings shall receive an approved concurrency determination. Exemption from concurrency review shall not affect any obligation to pay applicable impact fees and utility capacity charges. Appeals of determinations shall follow the procedures of section 165.04(D). 
Exempt property includes: 
(1)  Development found by the town attorney to have vested rights with regard to any effected roadway segments or infrastructure capacity reservations; both state statute and common law shall be considered; 
(2)  Permits for single-family homes deemed as "de minimis" under F.S. § 163.3180(5). Development of one single family dwelling on a legal lot of record as of July 1, 2008 which is on a lot in single and separate ownership from adjacent lots. This exemption shall apply to the permitting of a single-family dwelling on a lawfully created lot or parcel of record that meets minimum size requirements and is not subject to a plat notice which states that there is no guarantee of concurrency for development of the lot. This de minimis exemption will not apply if: 
(a)  The lawfully created lot or parcel does not meet minimum size requirements and has not received a duly approved variance authorizing the single-family dwelling, thereby ensuring that the lot or parcel is of sufficient size to accommodate a single-family dwelling while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public; or 
(b)  The impacts of the proposed new single-family dwelling will exceed the adopted level-of-service standard for any affected designated hurricane evacuation routes assigned to the town by the county emergency preparedness center, or successor agency; 
(3)  Any development or redevelopment which clearly causes no increase in square footage or increase in intensity of use. Where the proposed development or redevelopment of existing residential or nonresidential buildings will increase the square footage or the number of dwelling units respectively, only the net increase shall be subject to concurrency review; 
(4)  Modification of a vested final subdivision plat that does not create additional lots or units; 
(5)  Replacement of existing residential units unless there is an increase in number of units; and 
(6)  Any development orders, including land use amendments and rezoning applications, which do not increase density or intensity of use. 
(C)  Review procedures and fees. Each development application requiring a conditional or final concurrency review will be placed in a queue and shall be evaluated in the order in which it was received. The town manager or designee shall make a determination that concurrency requirements are satisfied for the type of development order under review. If the town manager elects to have a town consultant review for concurrency, the applicant shall bear the costs for the fees charged by the consultant and such fees shall be commensurate with the contracted fee schedule approved by the town in the consultant's contract. 
(1)  Demand and supply analysis. The applicant's calculated demand for each application will be compared to available capacity for each facility respectively per section 168.02.6 and section 168.02.7. Concurrency determinations relating to public school facilities shall be analyzed by the school district in accordance with section 14 of the adopted "Interlocal Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency," as may be amended from time to time. The county school district must review residential development applications that are not exempt to ensure that sufficient capacity is available to accommodate the demand represented by the application. The applicant, through an enforceable development agreement or proportionate fair-share mitigation agreements with the town, the county and/or the school district, may mitigate deficiencies in order to satisfy the concurrency review. Regulations for proportionate fair-share mitigation for transportation facilities are provided in section 168.03.1. Regulations for proportionate fair-share mitigation for public school facilities are provided in section 168.03.2. 
(2)  Conditional concurrency determination. A conditional concurrency determination shall be required concurrent with review of an application for approval of a preliminary development order for an amended comprehensive plan future land use map designation, a rezoning, a site plan, preliminary subdivision plan, final plat or a lot split, whichever occurs first. Approval of a conditional concurrency application shall not guarantee the applicant availability of capacity but rather is a preliminary analysis indicating that at the current time capacity is available with or without conditions. Any concurrency determination delivered prior to town approval of all building requirements shall be considered a conditional concurrency determination. Upon the town's approval of an application for a conditional concurrency determination, the town shall ensure that the records used to monitor the concurrency management system are appropriately updated including available capacity, encumbered capacity and committed but unencumbered capacity, as may be required. The monitoring system shall be coordinated with each concurrency facility provider. For instance, approval of conditional concurrency reviews shall cause a reduction in "available" capacity and cause an increase in "committed but unencumbered capacity." 
(3)  Final concurrency determination. Final concurrency determinations must be obtained prior to issuance of a building permit to construct (1) a net addition to the dwelling unit (2) a net addition to the available floor area for a nonresidential use or (3) an increased density or intensity for a specific use. An application for a final concurrency determination can only be approved after the applicant has completed all requirements for a building permit including final engineering, architectural and landscape architectural plans, and payment of requisite fees, including impact fees as applicable. Final concurrency determinations shall be rendered concurrently with building permit approvals. Approval of final concurrency reviews shall cause a reduction in either "available" capacity or "committed but unencumbered" capacity and shall cause an increase in "encumbered capacity." 
(a)  Final concurrency must occur prior to the release of a building permit. In order to obtain a building permit for a new building, expansion of a use or increase in the intensity of use, the applicant must have a valid final concurrency approval. A final concurrency approval is valid for 12 months from approval. Upon issuance of the building permit, the final concurrency approval shall be valid as long as the building permit is active. 
(b)  Final concurrency determinations for single-family dwellings . Applications for single-family dwellings shall be evaluated to determine if the application (1) is exempt from concurrency requirements pursuant to criteria listed in section 168.02.5(B) and (2) if not exempt, does the application comply with adopted levels of service standards for each concurrency facility identified in section 168.02.06. No building permit shall be issued for a single-family dwelling that has not first received a valid final concurrency approval for the concurrency facilities identified in section 168.02.4(B). Only a final concurrency review is required for such single-family dwellings. 
(c)  Final concurrency determinations for proposed subdivision plats or replats. When a new non-exempt, final plat application is filed to create single-family lots, the following notice shall appear on the face of the final plat: "No building permit will be issued for development of any lot or tract unless and until an approved concurrency determination for development of the lot or tract is obtained. The town does not guarantee that adequate capacity will exist at the time when an applicant or applicant's successor chooses to apply for and obtain an approved concurrency determination." 
In addition to the notice on the face of the final plat, a separate but similar "off-plat" notice (i.e., a stand-alone document that is not written on the plat) shall be prepared by the applicant in a manner approved by the town attorney. The applicant shall have the off-plat notice recorded in the county public records at the time that the final plat is recorded. A copy of the off-plat notice shall be attached to and recorded as an exhibit to the first deed that conveys each lot or tract to a party other than the subdivision developer. This deed exhibit requirement shall not apply to any lot or tract conveyed with a single-family residential unit already constructed on the lot at the time of conveyance. 
(4)  Approved concurrency determinations. The applicant shall meet all the requirements for approval of all required concurrency facilities in order to be eligible for approval of the concurrency portion of a development application. No concurrency approval will be issued until the potable water service, sanitary sewerage service, transportation, drainage, solid waste disposal and recreation requirements are met together with school concurrency requirements, if applicable. Final concurrency certificates shall be issued at the time of building permit issuance.

Sec. 168.02.6. - Measurement of levels of service. 
(A)  Water and wastewater. Measurement of the water capacity will be based on the design capacities of both the lines serving the property and the Vero Beach potable water supply system. Wastewater capacity will be measured in the same manner. Water demand and sewage generation rates will be based upon Table 168.02.6 (A)-1 and Table 168.02.6 (A)-2 below, or an alternative method acceptable to the Vero Beach director of water and sewer utility.

II. The town retains the authority to require appropriate information to be submitted in accordance with American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards to settle any dispute. 
(B)  Roadways. The standard for measuring highway capacities shall be the Florida DOT table of generalized daily level of service maximum volumes. Capacity may also be measured by engineering studies provided that analysis techniques are technically sound and acceptable to the town engineer or, in the case of a county or state maintained road, the methodology for determining demand and capacity shall be consistent with chapter 910, Indian River Land Development Code (as hereinafter may be amended) and acceptable to the county public works department. In determining capacity, existing volumes plus "committed" trips from approved site plans and recorded plats shall be included. Traffic generation shall be based upon the Institute of Transportation Engineers Manual. Impacts shall be presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot, or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot. 
(C)  Solid waste. Table 168.02.6 (C) may be used to calculate solid waste generation rates. Capacity is determined by the capacity of the county landfill.

(D)  Drainage. Drainage shall be measured based on assumed runoff rates (i.e., St. Johns River water management district or FDOT tables) subject to approval by the town engineer. Typically, this shall be achieved by a combination of on-site detention and French drains. 
(E)  Recreation. Measurement shall be based on data in the town comprehensive plan and latest town population estimate with any necessary interpretation provided by the town manager. 
(F)  Public school facilities. Evaluation of public school facilities levels of service, capacity and demand shall be determined by the county school district. Evaluation of public school facilities supply (capacity) shall be determined by each public school facility (elementary schools, middle schools and high schools), not including charter schools or magnet schools. The supply (capacity) for each school shall be its Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) capacity including the FISH capacity of programmed construction in the first three years of the school district five-year facilities work program. Capacity shall include capacity-producing mitigation guaranteed through any proportionate share mitigation agreements approved in accordance with section 14.8 of the adopted "Interlocal Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency," the public school facilities element of the comprehensive plan, and section 168.03.1. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.7. - Available capacity determination. 
(A)  General formula. For purposes of these regulations, the capacity availability shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
(a)  The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
(b)  The total design capacity of any new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the criteria stated in section 168.02.8 are achieved for each new facility respectively. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
(a)  The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
(b)  The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed site plan or plat by the anticipated completion of other presently approved development projects. 
(B)  Burden of showing compliance on applicant. The burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the applicant. In order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards. 
(C)  Concurrency monitoring system. The town building official shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the town comprehensive plan and town Land Development Code and shall enforce any conditions or stipulations contained in concurrency determinations. All existing and committed development and its impact on facilities subject to level of service standards shall be recorded. Monitoring shall include: 
(1)  A quarterly report of all changes in zoning districts; 
(2)  A quarterly summary of all building permits; 
(3)  A quarterly summary of all permits issued for demolition of buildings; and 
(4)  A quarterly summary of all certificates of occupancy. 
    The county school district shall monitor the status of concurrency for public school facilities on a continuing basis. In accordance with the adopted "Interlocal Agreement of Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency," the county school district shall maintain a database by school service area for existing and programmed school facilities, capacities committed through proportionate share mitigation agreements, Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) capacities, student enrollment, vested students by development project together with the duration of time vested, certificates of occupancy issued for vested residential units by project (subdivision) and available capacity. 
(D)  Concurrency rights reservation and effective period. 
(1)  Timing of capacity reservations. Although conditional concurrency determinations can occur at any stage in the development review process, the compliance will be finally calculated and capacity reserved at time a final development order is required, and/or pursuant to the terms of an enforceable developer's agreement or proportionate fair-share agreement. Applications for development permits shall be chronologically logged upon approval to determine rights to available capacity. 
(2)  Effective period. 
(a)  A building permit application must be submitted within 12 months of site plan approval to preserve the capacity reservation. An extension of one year may be issued by the town council. Only those dwelling units which have received their building permits will have their capacity reserved. 
(b)  Developer agreements as described in chapter 163.3220, the "Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act" or other enforceable development agreement shall have a valid concurrency period not to exceed five years or as may otherwise be provided in the development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.02.8. - Criteria for concurrency and final development orders. 
    A final development order shall not be granted for a proposed development unless the town finds that adequate capacity for concurrency facilities exists at or above adopted level of service in order to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development, or that improvements necessary to bring concurrency facilities up to their adopted level of service will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development. 
(A)  Solid waste and drainage. For solid waste and drainage facilities, the town shall find that the following criteria have been met for a proposed development to be found in compliance with concurrency management requirements: 
(1)  A development order is issued subject to the condition that, at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent, the necessary facilities and services are in place and available to serve the new development; or 
(2)  At the time a development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380 to be in place and available to serve new development at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent (Also reference F.S. § 163.3180(2)). 
(B)  Parks and recreation. For parks and recreation facilities, at a minimum, the town shall find that the following criteria have been met in order for a proposed development to be found in compliance with concurrency management requirements: 
(1)  At the time the final development order is issued, the necessary facilities and services shall be in place or under actual construction; or 
(2)  A final development order is issued subject to the condition that, at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the acreage for the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development shall be dedicated or acquired by the town, or funds in the amount of the developer's fair-share shall be committed; or 
(3)  A final development order is issued subject to the conditions that the necessary facilities and services needed to serve the new development shall be scheduled to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy as provided in the town capital improvements program. 
(C)  Sanitary sewer and potable water services. Prior to the release of a building permit, an applicant or property owner must provide the town manager or designee a notarized letter from the water and sewer service provider stating that the water supplies and potable water and sewer capacities are available and will be reserved for the subject development consistent with the town's adopted level of service standards. A duly authorized agent of the City of Vero Beach water and sewer utility or successor entity serving the town shall provide a letter certifying the following: 
(1)  At the time an occupancy permit or its functional equivalent is issued, the necessary facilities and capacity will be in place and available to serve the new development; or 
(2)  Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of site plan or plat approval and necessary facilities and capacity will be in place concurrent with the impacts of new development; or 
(3)  The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 or an agreement or development order pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. 
(D)  Transportation facilities. For transportation facilities, at a minimum, transportation supply shall be determined on a segment by segment basis and segment capacity will be based either on FDOT's generalized capacity tables or individual segment capacity studies approved by the town engineer or consultant. Transportation supply for each segment is the segment's existing peak hour, peak season, peak direction capacity or the segment's new roadway capacity if facility expansion for the segment is proposed, and if requisite conditions in section 168.02.8(D)(1) below are met. 
(1)  Requisite conditions to achieve concurrency. The town shall ensure that the following standards are met to satisfy concurrency requirements, unless state authorized exceptions are enacted by the town and duly approved by the state (Cross reference § 9J-20055 (4-7), F.A.C.). 
(a)  At the time the final development order is issued, the necessary facilities and services are in place or under actual construction; or 
(b)  A final development order or permit is issued subject to the conditions that the necessary facilities' expansion and services needed to serve the new development are scheduled to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of a building permit as provided in the town five-year capital improvements program. The town's capital improvement program may recognize and include transportation projects included in the first three years of the adopted state department of transportation five-year work program or the Indian River County Capital Improvement Program. The capital improvements element must include the following policies: 
(i)  The estimated date of commencement of actual construction and the estimated date of project completion; and 
(ii)  A provision that a plan amendment is required to eliminate, defer or delay construction of any road or public transit facility or service which is needed to maintain the adopted level of service standard and which is listed in the five-year capital improvements program; or 
(c)  At the time the final development order is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed agreement which requires the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy; or 
(d)  At the time the final development order is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. chapter 380, to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy; or 
(e)  The segment is the subject of a proportionate fair-share agreement. In such case, the segment capacity increase reflected in the proportionate fair-share agreement shall be available only to the parties of said agreement. 
(2)  Exceptions. For the purpose of issuing a final development order, a proposed development may be deemed to have a de minimis impact and is exempt from the transportation concurrency requirements based on the following criteria: 
(a)  The development is exempt if it is for redevelopment of an existing development and the post-development condition has a density and/or intensity equal to or less than the pre-existing development; 
(b)  The development is exempt if the traffic generated by the development would not affect more than one percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facility as determined by the town engineer, provided however, it shall not be exempt if the sum of existing roadway volumes and the projected volumes from approved projects on a transportation facility would exceed 110 percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facility; 
(c)  Existing single family lots shall be exempt from the concurrency management regulations if the lot is a conforming lot or legal non-conforming lot existing prior to 1991 (adoption date of the town comprehensive plan) regardless of the level of the deficiency of the roadway; or 
(d)  Notwithstanding any of the above, no development will be exempt if it would cause the adopted level-of-service standard to be exceeded for any affected designated hurricane evacuation routes. 
(E)  Public school facilities. Evaluation of public school facilities levels of service, capacity and demand shall be determined by the county school district. School concurrency shall be determined for each public school facility (elementary schools, middle schools and high schools), not including charter schools or magnet schools. 
(1)  School facility capacity. Capacity for each school shall be its Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) Capacity including the FISH Capacity of programmed construction in the first three years of the school district five-year facilities work program. Capacity calculations for each school service area shall include capacity-producing mitigation guaranteed through any proportionate fair-share mitigation agreements approved in accordance with § 14.8 of the adopted "Interlocal Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency," the public school facilities element of the comprehensive plan and section 168.03.1 of this chapter. 
(2)  School 25 facility demand; School concurrency exemptions. The county school district shall determine public school facility demand. Demand shall be calculated only for residential development with the following exemptions: 
(a)  All legal, single-family lots of record on July 1,2008. 
(b)  Valid residential developments approved prior to July 1, 2008. Any residential development that received a final site plan approval prior to July 1, 2008 where that approval has not expired and the approval remains valid. 
(c)  Amendments not increasing number of DUs, size or type. Any amendment to any previously approved residential development which does not increase the number of dwelling units or change the dwelling unit structure type, such as single-family or multiple-family dwelling unit. 
(d)  Certain age restricted communities. Any age restricted community with no permanent residents under the age of 18 years old. Exemption of an age restricted community will be subject to a restrictive covenant limiting the age of permanent residents to 18 years and older. Said covenant shall be in a form acceptable to the town attorney and shall be recorded in the public records prior to site plan approval and where no site plan is required prior to the release of a building permit for constructing improvements to a new subdivision or any dwelling unit. 
(e)  School district to issue exemption determination. Upon request by a developer submitting an application for any new residential development, the county school district shall issue a determination as to whether or not the development, lot or unit, is exempt from the requirements of school concurrency. Residential development that fits into one of the four categories referenced above in subsection 168.02.8(E)(2)(a-d) in this section shall be exempt from public school facilities concurrency review. 
(f)  School district procedure for calculating demand. The system demand shall be calculated for each public school facility (elementary schools, middle schools and high schools), not including charter schools or magnet schools, and shall consist of student enrollment as counted for the fall full time equivalent (FTE) students projected to be generated from residential development vested for school concurrency under these school concurrency regulations and students projected to be generated from approved residential developments that fall within exemption categories pursuant to state law, and for which a building permit has been issued. Project demand shall be calculated as students projected to be generated from proposed development projects residential units based on the student generation rates contained in the adopted "Intergovernmental Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency" and the public school facilities element of the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Formula for determining available public school facility capacity. The county school district shall determine available public school facility capacity using the following formula: 
Available school capacity-(school capacity) - (enrollment + vested) 
Where: 
School capacity -Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) capacity, including the FISH capacity of schools programmed for construction in the first three years of the school district five-year facilities work program; 
Enrollment -Student enrollment as counted at the fall FTE; and 
Vested -Students projected to be generated from residential developments approved after the implementation of school concurrency where all school impact fees have been paid, plus students projected to be generated from residential building permits issued since implementation of school concurrency for lots that existed prior to implementation of school concurrency where either (1) no certificate of occupancy has been issued or (2) a certificate of occupancy has been issued since the last fall FTE. 
(a)  At the fall FTE, the vested number of students will be reduced by the number of students represented by the vested residential units that received certificates of occupancy within the previous 12-month period. 
(b)  If a proposed residential development causes the adopted level of service to be exceeded in the school service area in which the proposed residential development is located, the available capacity in the adjacent school service area(s) shall be used. 
(c)  Available capacity determination shall be stated in a School Capacity Availability Determination Letter (SCADL), as required in the adopted "Interlocal Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency". Each SCADL shall state the total number and type of residential units for which school capacity is available and shall be sent to the coordinating agency (community development) and the applicant. 
(4)  Public school facilities concurrency test. The test for public school facilities concurrency shall be a comparison of project demand and available capacity. A project shall be deemed to meet public school facilities concurrency if available capacity exceeds project demand. 
(F)  Concurrency determination assignability and transferability. 
(1)  Concurrency approval runs with land. Concurrency determination shall run with the land and shall transfer to a successor in interest to the original applicant upon written disclosure of such transfer to the town manager. 
(2)  Application for assignability and transferability. The following information shall be disclosed in all applications pertaining to concurrency: 
(a)  Full legal name of the person or business entity acquiring the interest in the property; 
(b)  Nature of the interest; 
(c)  Address of the principal place of business of the successor; 
(d)  Telephone number; 
(e)  Name and address of registered agent if corporation; 
(f)  Name, address and title of officers or agents authorized to transact business with the town; 
(g)  Proof of authorization if other than president or vice-president or general partner; and 
(h)  Name and address of any new design professional for the project if applicable. 
(3)  Burdens on transferee applicant. A transferee applicant must also assume, in writing on a form acceptable to the town attorney, all commitments, responsibilities and obligations of the prior applicant, including all special conditions of the concurrency determination certificate. 
(4)  Suspension of concurrency approval. Failure to make the required disclosure and assumption shall suspend a concurrency approval until such time as proper disclosure and assumption are made. 
(5)  Time constraints unaffected. Transfer of a concurrency approval until concurrency determination shall not toll or modify the calculation of time limits set forth in the concurrency determination approval. Following any transfer, such time limits shall be calculated as if the transfer had not occurred. 
(6)  Not assignable or transferable to other developments. A concurrency determination certificate shall not be assignable or transferable to other developments. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.03. - Proportionate fair-share options to mitigate deficit transportation facilities and public school facilities. 
Sec. 168.03.1. - Proportionate fair-share option to mitigate deficit transportation facilities. 
(A)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program. 
(B)  Findings. The town council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors, and that the town's proportionate fair-share program: 
(1)  Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
(2)  Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of expanding or improving a transportation facility; 
(3)  Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; and 
(4)  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may, in certain circumstances, allow the town to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements budget. 
(C)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to any development project in the town where the project's traffic impact study or the town engineer determines that there is insufficient capacity on one or more segments to satisfy the development project's transportation concurrency requirements. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in section 168.02.5(B). 
(D)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant whose project meets the criteria of section 168.03 may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution pursuant to the following requirements: 
(a)  The proposed development is consistent with the town comprehensive plan and applicable Land Development Code regulations, and 
(b)  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the town's Capital Improvements Element (CIE) includes one or more transportation improvements that, upon completion, will provide sufficient capacity for the deficient segments to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  The town may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program by the developer contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will create additional capacity on the deficient segment sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicant's proposed development, even if the improvement project for the deficient segment is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE where: 
(a)  The town council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate fair-share agreement and corresponding future changes to the five-year CIE, and 
(b)  The town adopts, by ordinance, an amendment adding the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet a developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the town for locally maintained roadways and of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for the state highway system. 
(E)  Application process. 
(1)  Upon identification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of section 168.03.1. 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall attend a pre-application meeting with the town manager or designee to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and related issues. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the town manager or designee that includes an application fee as established by resolution and the following: 
(a)  Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
(b)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(c)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(d)  Project description including type, intensity and amount of development; 
(e)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(f)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); 
(g)  Copy of concurrency application; 
(h)  Copy of the project's Traffic Impact Statement (TIS) or Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA); and 
(i)  Location map depicting the site and affected road network. 
(4)  The town manager or designee shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. Should the application require the town to use the professional services of a consultant, the applicant shall bear all expenses incurred by the town for use of such consultant services. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in section 168.02 and section 168.03.1, then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The town council may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete and eligible, a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the town or the applicant with direction from the town and delivered to the appropriate parties for review. 
(6)  The town manager or designee shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the town council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the town council. 
(F)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ based on the form of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be based on the cumulative number of peak hour, peak direction trips from the complete build-out of the proposed development, or build-out of the stage or phase being approved, that are assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided by the change in the peak hour directional maximum service volume (MSV) of the proportionate share program segment resulting from construction of the proportionate share program improvement, multiplied by the anticipated construction cost of the proportionate share project in the year that construction will occur. 
This methodology is expressed by the following formula: 
Proportionate Fair-Share = S ((Development trips i ) ÷ (SV Increase i )) × cost i ) 
(Note: In the context of the formula, the term "cumulative" does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development.) 
Where: 
S = Sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fair-share mitigation for a project; 
Development Trips i = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment " i " and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; 
SV Increase i =Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment " i "; and 
Cost i =Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment " i ". Cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs including design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur. 
(4)  For purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the town shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. The town shall coordinate the review of impacts to state or county maintained roads with the county public works department. Any county fees associated with review of impacts or needed improvements to state or county maintained roads, including engineering, design and cost estimates, shall be paid by the applicant. 
(5)  If the town has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the county public works director or other method approved by the county public works director. 
(6)  If the town has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the town and at no expense to the town. Said appraisal shall assume no approved development plan for the site. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the town at no expense to the town. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant (based on a town approved appraisal) is less than the town estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant (based on a town approved appraisal) is more than the town estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for the development, then the town will give the applicant traffic impact fee credit for the difference. 
(G)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation payments for a development project shall be applied as a credit toward the traffic impact fees assessed to that development project. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for a proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the traffic impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant must pay the remaining impact fee amount. 
(3)  A proportionate fair-share contribution is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any traffic impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development may not be transferred to any other location. 
(4)  The amount of traffic impact fee (TIF) credit for a proportionate fair-share contribution may be up to but shall not exceed the project's proportionate fair-share amount and will be determined based on the following formula: 
TIF Credit = ((Proportionate fair-share impacted roadways' VMT) ÷ (Total Project VMT)) × (total project traffic impact fee liability) 
Where: 
VMT (Vehicle miles of travel on a link) = (length of link)×(number of trips assigned to that link); and 
Total Project VMT = Total vehicle miles of travel on all links impacted by proportionate fair-share project. 
(5)  A proportionate fair-share impact fee credit shall be applied consistent with the following formula: 
Applicant payment = ((Total project traffic impact fees assessed) + (Proportionate Share Payment)) - (TIF Credit) 
(H)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon executing a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) and satisfying other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive concurrency approval for subject trips. Should the applicant fail to apply for building permits within the timeframe provided for in the town concurrency approval, then the project's concurrency vesting shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply. Once a proportionate share payment for a project is made, other impact fees for the project are paid and all other aspects of the Agreement are fulfilled, no refunds shall be given and trips shall be deemed vested. All vested trips shall run with the land. 
(2)  All developer improvements accepted as proportionate fair-share contributions must be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair-share agreement (unless otherwise provided in the agreement) and be accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. The security instrument shall conform to specifications set by the town council and approved by the town attorney. 
(3)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to the agreement must occur at a date as specified in the agreement. 
(4)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(5)  Applicants may withdraw from a proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the town are nonrefundable. 
(6)  The town may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(I)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the town capital improvements element, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the proportionate fair-share revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that same corridor or sector where the alternative improvement will mitigate the impacts of the development project on the congested roadway(s) for which the original proportionate fair-share contribution was made. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.03.2. - Proportionate fair-share mitigation for public school facilities. 
    The proportionate fair-share mitigation provisions for public school facilities shall apply to any residential development project subject to school concurrency located in Indian River County where the school district has determined that there is insufficient public school facilities capacity to satisfy the development's public school facilities concurrency requirements. The school district shall process for consideration all requests for proportionate fair-share mitigation for public school facilities and shall administer resulting mitigation agreements in accordance with section 14.8 of the adopted "Interlocal Agreement for Coordinated Planning and School Concurrency" and the public school facilities element of the town comprehensive plan.

(F)  Approval period. 
(1)  Commencement of construction. All site plan approvals shall terminate and become null and void automatically without notice if a building permit has not been issued and construction has not commenced within 12 months from the date of approval. For the purposes of this division, construction shall be deemed to have commenced when the developer has built a portion of a structure shown on the plan (for example, the pouring of footers) or has made substantial improvements to the site other than land clearing, filling or grading in accordance with the approved site plan evidencing a good faith effort to diligently pursue construction to completion. 
(2)  Extensions of site plan approval. Site plan approval may be extended one time only for good cause by the town council for a period not to exceed 12 months. All requests for extensions must be in writing on a form supplied by the town and received by the town prior to expiration of the site plan. Upon receiving an extension, all approved site plans shall comply with applicable town regulations as they exist on the date the extension is granted. 
(3)  Abandonment of construction. 
(a)  In cases where construction is abandoned or suspended after commencement, as defined above, the site plan approval shall terminate and become null and void after notice and hearing by the town council. For the purpose of this division, construction shall be considered abandoned or suspended if: 
(i)  The town council finds during the hearing that an active building permit has not been maintained for the construction of a structure in accordance with the approved plan; or 
(ii)  The town council finds during the hearing that construction at a level indicating a good faith effort to proceed with the completion of the project has not occurred for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding the receipt of notice. 
(b)  However, the town council shall not deem this inactivity to constitute project abandonment or suspension if the inactivity is deliberate and entirely consistent with a town council approved schedule for the phasing of a multiphase project. This division shall not operate to invalidate any site plan prior to the end of the initial 12-month period or any authorized extension thereof. 
(4)  Site plan requirement and schedule of phasing; lapses. 
(a)  Any planned multi-phased project to be approved by the town council shall include an approved schedule for the phasing of construction. In addition, if a complete site plan for each phase of the proposed project is not initially submitted, a schedule of future site plan submissions for each successive project phase shall be approved by the town council as part of the initial site plan approval. 
(b)  A person shall be required to request town council approval of an amended schedule of phasing for any planned multi-phase project if the approved schedules for site plan submittal or construction lapses. Upon receiving an approval of an amended schedule of phasing, the site plans for respective future phases shall comply with all applicable town regulations as they exist on the date the amendment is granted. 
(5)  Transfer of site plan approval to run with land. 
(a)  A site plan approval shall run with the land and shall transfer to a successor in interest to the original applicant upon written disclosure of the transfer, including the identity of the successor in ownership. The disclosure shall be submitted to the town manager and shall provide the full legal name of the person or business entity acquiring an interest in the property, the nature of the interest, the address of the principal place of business, the telephone number of the successor in ownership and the name and address of any registered agent of the owner. If the new owner is a corporation, the enclosure shall include the name, address and title of officers or agents authorized to transact business with the town, and the name and address of any new design professional for the project. 
(b)  Upon site plan transfer, the successors in interest shall provide a written acknowledgment and acceptance of all commitments, responsibilities and obligations of the prior developer, including all special conditions of site plan approval. This written acknowledgement shall be in a form acceptable to the town attorney and shall be approved by the town attorney. 
(c)  The following provisions shall also apply to transfer of site plan approvals: 
(i)  Disclosure of requisite information. Failure to make the required disclosure and assumption shall suspend all site plan and zoning approvals until such time as proper disclosure and assumption is made. 
(ii)  Time limits. Transfer of site plan approval shall not toll or modify the calculation of time limits set forth with respect to commencement or abandonment of construction. Following any transfer, the time limits shall be calculated as if the transfer had not occurred. 
(iii)  Transferability exceptions. This provision does not relate to any transfer of space, units, buildings or property to a transferee who intends to occupy the property only after issuance of a certificate of occupancy, unless the transferee is the successor developer, nor to the creation or transfer of a nonpossessory lien or encumbrance. 
(G)  Posting of bonds. 
(1)  Improvement or public facility bond. Upon final site plan approval by the town council, the applicant shall post a bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state in an amount estimated by the mayor or his designee to be equal to the cost of constructing required public facilities. The bond shall be in favor of the town and shall be subject to the condition that all of the improvements will be completed within one year after approval of the site plan. In the event they are not so completed within that time, the town may proceed with the work and hold the applicant and the surety jointly and severally responsible for the cost thereof. As an alternative surety, the applicant may deposit a certified check or cash with the town treasurer or any other bond provisions as the town council deems adequate to insure compliance with this provision. 
(2)  Site restoration bond. See section 168.05. 
(H)  Violations. 
(1)  Failure to comply and continually maintain all approved elements of an approved site plan, including landscape, appearance and other site development features, shall be a violation of this title, subject to the enforcement and penalty procedure of section 168.04(H)(2) below. 
(2)  In the event of a noncompliance with this subchapter, the mayor or the town building official shall have the authority to suspend and revoke any building permit used under this subchapter and to take all actions necessary to halt construction until that time as the provisions herein are complied with. In the event legal action is necessary and costs are incurred by the town in forcing compliance, these expenses shall be borne by the developer or other parties violating the terms of this subchapter. 
(I)  Site plan review criteria. The planning, zoning and variance board and the town council shall use the appropriate foregoing chapters of this title or Code plus the following criteria in reviewing site plans: 
(1)  Appearance of site and structures. The appearance of the site and structures shall be coordinated for the purpose of creating a pleasing and harmonious overall effect. The choice of building and site improvements shall be commensurate with the objectives of the subject use without generating adverse visual impact on surrounding properties or transportation corridors. Architectural style or design is not restricted. Evaluation of the appearance of a project shall be based on the quality of its design and relationship to the impacted area considering the following factors. 
(a)  Urban design . The exterior of buildings and structures including mass, facade and materials shall be in harmony with the site and the impacted area and not gaudy or garish. Awnings or ornamental features shall be designed in a manner harmonious with the building design and shall be of appropriate scale, shape, color scheme and pattern in order to reinforce good design principles. Similarly, awnings or ornamental features shall not use incompatible or extraordinary scale, shapes, color schemes, patterns or other extraordinary features for purposes of attracting attention. 
(b)  Colors. They shall be harmonious with development in the impacted area and not gaudy or garish, with bright or brilliant colors used only for accent. 
(c)  Mechanical equipment. This and other utility hardware other than antennas and stacks on roofs shall be harmonious with the building or they shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from any public ways within the impacted area. 
(d)  Dumpsters. Refuse and waste removal areas shall be screened from adjacent properties and public ways by appropriate fences, walls or hedges. In cases where dumpsters must be located in areas highly visible from any public right-of-way, the planning, zoning and variance board shall be authorized to require an appropriate vegetative or structural screen to shield an unsightly condition. 
(e)  Outdoor uses . All businesses, services or other commercial activities shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings. 
(f)  Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be arranged so as to shield or deflect the light from adjoining properties, beaches and public streets. Chapter 164 of this Code shall control signs and their lighting.

Water, sewer, drainage, streets and walkway facilities shall be designed in accordance with the standard specifications as exist or as hereafter amended and on file with the town building official; installation shall minimize impact on the environment, including tree canopy and soil stability. 
(5)  On-site drainage. 
(a)  Plans. A concept plan for drainage of surface water run-off supplied by the applicant shall be approved by the town engineer prior to consideration of a site plan by the planning, zoning and variance board. Prior to application for a building permit, a detailed drainage plan prepared by a professional engineer or registered architect registered in the state shall be approved by the town engineer. A state registered professional engineer or registered architect shall certify that the drainage plan has been appropriately implemented prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. 
(b)  Detention. Surface water management systems shall be designed and constructed to detain with filtration or retain as a minimum the runoff from a 25-year frequency, 24-hour design storm. Post development runoff shall not exceed pre-development runoff. 
(6)  Environmental assessment. An environmental assessment report shall be prepared which demonstrates compliance with all applicable portions of chapter 167 of this Code. It shall also demonstrate appropriate passive energy conservation measures, including building and window orientation, and landscaping. 
(7)  Natural drainage. A natural vegetative buffer or littoral zone of three feet shall be provided along any natural drainage way unless the drainage way is a wetland or other vegetated area. See also section 167.08.

(4)  Performance guarantee, abandonment and expiration. The secured obligation shall guarantee that the site will be promptly restored to its original state, so far as is possible, if the construction is abandoned. In default thereof, the amount of the security shall be paid, on demand, to the town for its use in effecting the restoration or retained by it as liquidated damages if complete restoration is impossible or impracticable or if restoration costs would exceed the amount of the security. Construction shall be deemed to have been abandoned if the applicant or his successors or assigns so notify the building department, in writing, or if work on the premises ceases prior to the completion of the improvement and is not resumed within 30 days of the expiration of the building permit. The secured obligation shall have an expiration date at least one year after the expected construction completion date as reflected on the building permit application. 
(B)  Permit inspections and documentation. 
(1)  Erosion control requirements/inspections to commence prior to land clearing. Erosion and sedimentary control inspections will be performed by the town to verify compliance with the approved site erosion and sediment control plan during the construction process. Inspections will occur at construction commencement, during construction and upon completion of construction. Erosion and control sediments shall be in place prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading activities other than that incidental activity necessary to install the perimeter controls. It shall be the responsibility of the developer/contractor to notify the town within 72 hours of expected construction commencement and expected construction completion of all projects within the town. If sufficient discrepancies are noted during the inspection, the developer/contractor shall be notified by the town within 72 hours of the inspection detailing the discrepancies along with any applicable enforcement action. Applicable enforcement actions include but are not limited to sanctions, fines and stop work orders as deemed necessary by the town's staff depending upon the severity of the discrepancy. 
(2)  Permit documentation. The applicant shall provide all applicable permit documentation from various agencies for the project including but not limited to the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), etc. as part of the plan review process prior to either construction plan approval or prior to the town releasing Certificate of Occupancy for the project. The applicant shall include all applicable permits that have either been obtained or submitted such as SJRWMD Environmental Resource Permits (ERPs), FDEP National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), FDOT drainage and drive connection permits, etc. This list is given as basic guidance and is by no means all-inclusive. Each project under review shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
(3)  Permits for tree removal and land clearing. Permits for tree removal, clearing of the land (except debrushing), excavation, grading or installation of utilities shall not be issued nor such work undertaken in areas beyond the limits of the area necessary for the construction of the building for which a building permit has been applied or site plan has been approved. The town building department shall determine, in writing, the limits of the area necessary for the satisfactory completion of the permitted work and such determination shall be deemed a condition of the permit. The construction area shall be fenced to avoid damage to other areas where determined necessary by the town building department. See chapter 167 of this Code. 
(C)  Failure to restore site. 
(1)  In the event the applicant, his successors or assigns fail to restore the site prior to abandonment, the town shall notify the applicant and his surety, guarantor or security agent as appropriate by certified mail, addressed to the last address furnished by the parties to the town, demanding performance or the guarantee sum deposit. Not later than ten days after the posting by the town of the demand, the applicant or his surety, guarantor or security agent shall deposit with the town building official the sum demanded by the town. This may be either the estimated cost of restoring the site to its original condition as nearly as possible or the full sum of the secured obligation. 
(2)  In the event there is a surplus in the deposit made on the town's demand after restoration of the site, the town shall refund to the depositor on his or her order the surplus after costs and expenses. If the amount received by the town is insufficient to restore the site, the applicant shall not be relieved of his or her obligation to complete the improvement or restore the site; and the applicant shall, upon further demand by the town, deposit the additional amount necessary to restore the site. 
(D)  Town construction of abandoned structures. By accepting the building permit at the time of undertaking construction, the landowner and the builder or builder/developer as agent for the landowner represents to the town the intention and ability to complete the construction for which the permit was requested. The landowner further consents to permit the town to undertake certain construction on any building, structure or development having been undertaken and subsequently abandoned. The extent to which the town may complete a structure or project is to make the exterior aesthetically pleasing and give the appearance of a finished structure so it will blend with structures in the surrounding area. In addition, the town may take such actions as are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, including but not limited to restoration of the site to its original condition, if practical, under the circumstances of each particular case. 
(E)  Project amenities. Any developer of a proposed project within the town shall identify, as specifically as possible, the time frame for completion of the amenities. It is the policy of the town to require completion of amenities in compliance with the site plan commitment. In furtherance of this goal, the developer shall be required to explain in writing the proposed timing of amenities for the development. In addition, a developer may be required to post a reasonable sum or surety to carry out the contemplated expenditures for amenities and common element improvements. In the event the town determines there is a failure to comply on the part of the developer, builder or owner, the town shall notify the developer of such failure of compliance and may stop work on the project. Further, the town may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy or refuse to issue a building permit for any violation of this section in not completing amenities and common elements or in otherwise failing to comply with the provisions of this subchapter. 
(F)  Procedural steps. 
(1)  Notice of violation and hearing .

(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.09. - Variance and administrative appeal. 
(A)  Variance. 
(1)  The planning, zoning and variance board. The board shall have the power to recommend approval or denial of applications from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to conditions unique to this site, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. The town council shall make the final decision. 
(a)  The town building official may grant approval of variances for encroachments by existing structures into building setback lines or easements of one foot or less. The application procedure and considerations in granting this variance shall be the same as set forth in section 165.04(D). 
(b)  The planning, zoning and variance board may, without approval of the town council, approve variances for encroachments by existing structures into building setback lines or easements of three feet or less. The application procedure and considerations in granting this variance shall be the same as set forth in section 165.04(D). 
(2)  Criteria. The planning, zoning and variance board shall approve a variance only after the applicant has demonstrated justification for the granting of a variance in conformance with the following criteria: 
(a)  Special conditions. That special conditions and circumstances exist affecting the land, structure or building involved preventing the reasonable use of said land, structure or building. 
(b)  Unique. That the circumstances which cause the hardship are peculiar to the property, or to such a small number of properties that they clearly constitute marked exceptions to other properties in the district. 
(c)  Hardship. That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of a substantial property right that is enjoyed by other property owners in the district. It is of no importance whatsoever that the denial of the variance might deny to the property owner some opportunity to use the property in a more profitable way, or to sell it at a greater profit than is possible under the terms of this chapter. 
(d)  Self-created. That the hardship is not self-created or the result of mere disregard for or ignorance of the provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Minimum variance. That the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the property. 
(f)  Adjacent property. That granting the variance requested will not be detrimental to adjacent property or adversely affect the public welfare and will be in harmony with the general intent of this chapter. 
(g)  Use variance. Under no circumstances shall the board grant a variance to permit a use not generally permitted in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district. 
(B)  Administrative appeal and re-submittal. 
(1)  Appeal. Appeal from any action taken by the planning, zoning and variance board must be filed with the town within 60 days of the action from which the appeal is taken. In the event any provision of the Land Development Code provides for a shorter appeal period, then said shorter period shall apply. 
(2)  Re-submittals after denial. 
(a)  Applicant must wait a period of one year following denial by the planning, zoning and variance board of any request for variance when the re-submittal is substantially the same as the denied request. 
(b)  Any requests, other than a variance request for action by the planning, zoning and variance board, may be denied if the board determines the issue has been previously addressed and denied within a one-year period of the submittal. 
(c)  The board shall also review any appeal of an administrative decision made by the town building official in administering this chapter and make a recommendation to the town council. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 1, 6-16-16) 
Sec. 168.10. - Nonconforming uses and lots. 
(A)  Elimination of nonconforming uses. Any use existing on the effective date of this Code which is classified as a nonconforming use in the zoning classification in which it is located shall be terminated by the year 2000. By July 1, 1991, the town building official shall issue a special certificate of occupancy to the owner of all nonconforming uses which shall state the future date of termination of the nonconforming use, and said special certificate of occupancy shall be prominently displayed on said property. 
    Any owner that perceives the year 2000 date to constitute a unique hardship may apply to the planning, zoning and variance board. All applications for extensions must be submitted to the town building official by January 1, 1992; said applications must be accompanied by an appraisal, and a statement of what is unique to this use and structure. No extension shall be granted beyond the year 2010. The board is authorized to hire tax, accounting and/or architectural experts (at the expense of the applicant) to assist in assessing the stated hardship. 
(B)  Expansion or discontinuance of nonconforming use. No nonconforming building containing a nonconforming use shall be structurally changed, altered, enlarged or moved unless the altered, enlarged or moved building or use shall conform to the provisions of the district in which it is located; provided, however, redevelopment of a nonconforming building or a nonconforming use which results in a decrease in the degree of nonconformity may be approved by the town council if the town council finds that the redevelopment will not adversely affect adjacent property and that it would not adversely affect the public welfare. No nonconforming use, if discontinued or changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall be resumed or changed back to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be deemed discontinued for the purpose of this section if a nonconforming use is not made of the property for a period of one year. For the purposes of this section, "redevelopment" shall mean new construction which replaces pre-existing construction on a site. 
(C)  Effect of enactment of code. The enactment of this Code shall not be deemed to affect, alter or change any special exception or variance heretofore granted by the appropriate administrative or legislative body of the town or by a court of competent jurisdiction upon review of the action of the administrative or legislative body. 
(D)  Restoration of damaged buildings. Nothing in this section shall prevent the restoration of a building damaged by fire, explosion, an act of God or an act of the public enemy subsequent to the effective date of this chapter or prevent the continuance of the use of the building or part thereof as the use existed at the time of the impairment of the building or part thereof. However, the restoration shall be no greater than 50 percent of the structure's total current replacement value, the restoration shall be made within one year and the same use shall be made of the premises. The restoration must be comparable in quality to the remaining structure. In no instance shall a nonconforming use be permitted to be restored when more than 50 percent of its total current replacement value has been destroyed. The provisions of (A) above shall still apply. 
(E)  Repairs and maintenance. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the strengthening or restoration of any building or wall declared unsafe by the town building official. 
(F)  Nonconforming lots. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width or both area and width that are generally applicable in the district. However, front, side and rear yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area, width, or both area and width of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located.
