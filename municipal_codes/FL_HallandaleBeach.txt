PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hallandale Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through June 17, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been arranged in the order as directed by the city, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. New chapters may also be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE 1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of W. Eric Grant, Vice President, Regina Sosinski, Editor, and Janet Cramer, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to David Jove, City Attorney, and E. Dent McGough, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Hallandale Beach readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-34. - Procedure and meetings. 
(a)  Voting. Voting on ordinances and resolutions shall be by a randomized roll call and shall be recorded. A majority of the commission shall constitute a quorum; but a smaller number may adjourn from time to time and may compel the attendance of absent members in the manner and subject to the penalties prescribed by the rules of the commission. No action of the commission, except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence and in Charter § 3.09(3), shall be valid or binding unless adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the commission. 
(b)  Presiding officer and sergeant-at-arms. 
(1)  The presiding officer of the city commission shall be the mayor or, in the mayor's absence, the vice mayor. In the absence of both the mayor and the vice mayor, a temporary presiding officer shall be selected by seniority of office of those commissioners present. The presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum at all regular and special meetings of the city commission and shall have the authority to regulate irrelevant debate, repetitious discussion and disruptive behavior at a public meeting. The presiding officer shall decide all questions of order and decorum, subject, however, to an appeal of said decision forthwith by a member of the city commission, in which event a majority vote of the city commission shall govern and conclusively determine such question of order or decorum. 
(2)  The chief of police, or his designee, shall be the sergeant-at-arms of the city commission meetings. The sergeant-at-arms shall carry out all orders and instructions given by the presiding officer, or the majority of the commission if an appeal has been taken, for the purpose of maintaining order and decorum in the city commission meeting. Upon instruction of the presiding officer, it shall be the duty of the sergeant-at-arms to take appropriate and lawful action to maintain the order and decorum of the meeting. 
(c)  Public participation. The city commission recognizes the importance of protecting the right of its citizens and taxpayers to express their opinions on the operation of city government and encourages citizen participation in the local government process. The city commission also recognizes the necessity for conducting orderly and efficient meetings in order to complete city business in a timely and proper manner. Therefore, a summary of the rules of decorum contained in this section, prepared by the city attorney, shall be read by the city clerk prior to the first public comment of every meeting and included in the published agenda. 
(d)  Decorum and disorderly conduct. 
(1)  Disorderly conduct. It is prohibited for any person to disturb or interrupt any meeting of the city commission or otherwise fail to comport with the rules of decorum herein. The following behavior shall not be considered orderly or decorous: 
a.  The use of obscene or profane language. 
b.  Loud and disruptive speech or other loud and boisterous behavior. 
c.  Any physical violence or the threat thereof. 
d.  Use of "fighting words" (e.g., words likely to cause a fight, that are threatening or tending to cause a breach of the peace, or speech that threatens harm). 
e.  Engaging in personal attacks. Remarks should be directed to the presiding officer or the board as a whole and not to individual commissioners. 
f.  Irrelevant, impertinent, or slanderous remarks. Speakers shall confine their comments solely to the agenda item being discussed or, during non-agenda public comment, to matters related to city business. Unless it is an agenda item, speakers are prohibited from discussing their own pending court cases and filed claims or complaints against the city or city personnel. 
g.  Engaging in electioneering or campaign activities. 
h.  Engaging in commercial speech or advertising unrelated to an item on the agenda. 
(2)  Unruly audience behavior such as applause, audible conversations, booing, harassing remarks or other audience outburst will not be tolerated. The city commission is not allowed to consider such material and it intimidates and takes time away from other speakers. 
(3)  It is prohibited for any person by speech or otherwise to delay or interrupt the proceedings or the peace of the city commission or disturb any person having the floor. No person shall refuse to obey the orders of the presiding officer. Disorderly conduct determined by the presiding officer or a majority of the city commission to be intended as a disruption of the meeting and a failure to comply with any lawful decision or order of the presiding officer or of a majority of the city commission, shall constitute a disturbance. 
(4)  If the presiding officer or a majority of the commission declares an individual out of order, the individual will be cautioned. The individual shall be allowed the opportunity to conclude remarks on the subject in a decorous manner within the designated time limit. The presiding officer may bar any person failing to comply as cautioned from making any additional comments during the meeting, unless permission to continue or again address the commission is granted by the majority of the commission members present. 
(5)  Any person who becomes disruptive or interferes with the orderly business of the commission may be removed from the commission chambers or other meeting room for the remainder of the meeting and may be arrested by the police chief, or designee, subject to F.S. § 810.08(1) or § 871.01.

Sec. 2-38. - Agenda preparation. 
(a)  The city clerk is responsible for preparing meeting agendas. The city manager, city clerk, city attorney, or any commissioner may place an item on a meeting agenda for action. 
(b)  Consent agenda. The city manager is directed to designate a consent agenda listing those items deemed by the city manager to be noncontroversial. Prior to the approval of the items on the consent agenda, any item therein may be withdrawn by a city commissioner, the city manager, the city attorney, or city clerk. Such withdrawal shall be nondebatable. After such items have been withdrawn from the consent agenda, the commission may consider a motion to adopt the remaining items listed in the consent agenda in a single motion. Any resident may request an item be pulled from the consent agenda during public participation, but the granting of such a request will be at the discretion of the city commission. 
(c)  Staff responsibilities. The city manager shall decide the order of items on the agenda. The city manager shall take all necessary steps to avoid unnecessary duplication of supporting documentation for items on the agenda. Each item placed on the agenda shall have sufficient supporting documentation to enable the city commissioners to prepare for discussion on that item. Items requiring a resolution or ordinance may not be placed on the agenda unless the city attorney has provided the necessary resolution or ordinance. 
(d)  Removal or pulling of items. No item placed on the agenda may be removed from the published agenda without the consent of the person placing such item on the agenda. At the meeting, the mayor may declare that an item is pulled (a term used to indicate removal) or deferred from the meeting's agenda, and no vote shall be required in that event. If any commissioner objects, the pulling or deferral of an item on the agenda may be overruled by a majority vote of commissioners present. 
(e)  Distribution. Agendas should be distributed seven calendar days before a regular meeting, including workshops (e.g., the Wednesday preceding a Wednesday meeting), but shall be distributed no later than 5:00 p.m. on the sixth day preceding the meeting (e.g., the Thursday before a Wednesday meeting). The agenda packet shall be delivered to the members of the city commission electronically. Printed copies may be delivered upon request. 
(f)  Addenda to the regular meeting agenda may be prepared with the approval of the mayor or city manager prior to any session of the city commission, but should be distributed to commissioners no less than 48 hours before the meeting. 
(g)  As a courtesy, the city manager shall be responsible for ensuring that individuals known to be specially affected by a particular item on the agenda item be notified. Such notice need not be in writing, but may be by telephone if conditions warrant. Failure to provide this notification shall not be grounds to challenge the validity of a commission action.

Sec. 2-39. - Police and firefighters' board of trustees. 
    The city commission shall appoint two individuals, either city commissioners or other legal resident of the city, to serve as regular members of the city police officers' and firefighters' board of trustees. The city commission's appointment of its members to serve as members of the city police officers' and firefighters' board of trustees, shall serve as an ex officio duty of their office as city commissioner. Any city commissioners appointed to the city police officers' and firefighters' board of trustees shall perform their ex officio duties as members of the city police officers' and firefighters' board of trustees as authorized by law.

(b)  The city commission may require, as a condition of the privilege of extended hours of operation, compliance with any reasonable conditions deemed by the commission to be necessary to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects of that operation. These conditions may include, without being limited to, provision by the owner or operator or the licensee, at his expense, of additional off-street parking, security personnel, and screening and buffering from nearby properties. 
(c)  The granting of extended hours of operation, either citywide or to a particular licensee, has been and continues to be a privilege subject to modification or termination by the city commission each year at renewal time; and no person may reasonably rely on the continuation of that privilege. 
(d)  All nightclub licenses shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on September 30 of each year unless previously renewed by the city commission. The development services director shall place all current nightclub licenses on the agenda for the first regular city commission meeting in August and shall notify all licensees of that date. The city commission may deny renewal, grant renewal or grant conditional renewal. The specific criteria for city commission consideration in making the decision shall be the same criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section for the original issuance. 
(e)  If prior to renewal time the city manager determines that any licensee has either violated a condition of renewal or is operating in a manner harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, he may place on the city commission agenda the matter of revoking the nightclub license, providing at least ten days written notice to the licensee of the charges against him and the date, time and place of the agenda item, and, after consideration of the matter, and allowing the licensee to be heard, the city commission may revoke, modify or condition the nightclub license. In deciding whether to revoke the license, the city commission shall consider the specific criteria contained in section 5-9(a)(1-3). The licensee may seek review of the city commission's decision as provided by law. 
(f)  In addition to the business tax, each licensee shall pay an annual nonrefundable application fee and, in the event of approval, a regulatory fee to defray the costs of policing and regulation. Such fees are on file in the development services department. 
(g)  A nightclub business license issued under the provisions of this section may not be assigned or transferred without consent of the city commission.

ARTICLE VIII. - GASOLINE RETAIL OUTLETS 

Sec. 7-311. - Outlets required to post prices. 
    All gasoline outlets (defined for the purposes of this article as those places within the city where gasoline is dispensed at retail for use as a fuel in motor vehicles) are required to post prices for the fuel sold at that location on a sign which is easily readable from a passing motor vehicle on the public street abutting the gasoline outlet. If a gasoline outlet abuts more than one public street, a sign of the type required by this article shall be placed so as to be easily readable from each public street providing access to the gasoline outlet. No more than one sign per abutting public street shall be required or permitted. 
(Code 1980, § 18-131) 
Sec. 7-312. - Sign specifications. 
(a)  In order to accomplish the requirements of section 7-311, the signs required shall be so placed as to allow an unobstructed view of the face of the sign from the public street abutting the gasoline outlet. In no event shall the required sign be placed, however, in such a manner that it obscures the vision of drivers so as to create an unsafe condition for persons operating motor vehicles on the public streets. 
(b)  The prices displayed on the required signs shall be posted in numerals no smaller than ten inches. If a gasoline outlet sells more than one grade of leaded gasoline or sells both leaded and unleaded gasoline, the unit price for at least one octane level of both leaded and unleaded gasoline shall be displayed on the required sign. 
(c)  All prices displayed on the required sign shall be the price charged for one U.S. gallon of gasoline of the specified type. If the price displayed is for less than one gallon, the fraction of one gallon that the specified price represents shall be displayed in numerals no smaller than five inches in height on the sign. 
(d)  If the gasoline outlet makes a different charge for gasoline which is pumped by the customer from that charged for gasoline pumped by an employee of the gasoline outlet, the required sign shall display the price charged for gasoline pumped by the customer unless the sign clearly indicates that the price is for gasoline pumped by an employee of the gasoline outlet. For the purposes of this section, the term "full-service" or "full-serve," when used on the required sign, shall be deemed a legally sufficient indication that the price displayed on the sign is for gasoline which is pumped by an employee of the gasoline outlet; and such information shall be displayed in letters no smaller than five inches in height. 
(Code 1980, § 18-132) 
Sec. 7-313. - Sign requirements deemed additional permitted signs.

A hearing so requested shall be granted as a matter of right. If a written request for a hearing is filed within the 14-day period, the request shall operate as a stay on the 14-day compliance or removal period until such time as the city commission has held a hearing on the alleged violation and rendered a decision. Any owner dissatisfied with the city commission's decision may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.

Where telephone notice is not feasible or where the owner fails to remove or relocate the newsrack following telephone notice of the emergency, the city manager or any person designated by him may summarily and temporarily remove or relocate such newsrack. Immediately following removal or relocation of any newsrack under these emergency procedures, the owner shall be provided written notice of the action and the nature of the emergency necessitating such action. Upon failure of the owner, following such written notice, to claim the newsrack and pay the costs of removal or relocation and storage within 30 days after notice, the newsrack shall be deemed unclaimed property in possession of the city and may be disposed of pursuant to law. The owner of any newsrack may file a written request for a hearing before the city commission after an emergency removal or relocation to dispute the determination of an emergency and/or the costs or removal or relocation sought by the city, and in addition may claim and take possession of the newsrack prior to the hearing. A hearing so requested shall be granted as a matter of right. Any owner dissatisfied with the city commission's decision at such hearing may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  Any newsrack which shall remain empty for a period of more than 30 continuous days for monthly or weekly publications and 15 continuous days for daily publications shall be deemed abandoned.

Sec. 8-36. - Building moratorium; procedures for establishment. 
(a)  Wherever it shall appear to the city manager that a specific zoning category or a specific area within the city should be reexamined to determine the effect of development of property as zoned on surrounding areas, or on the entire city's ability to furnish necessary services, or to maintain its existing quality of life, then using the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, the city manager shall immediately issue an administrative order delineating the areas in question and prohibiting the issuance of any building permits within the areas. 
(b)  Any administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be complied with by all city personnel and shall be effective until reversed, modified or superseded by resolution passed by the city commission. 
(c)  Immediately upon issuance of any administrative order pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the city manager shall place the matter on the next city commission agenda so that necessary public hearings may be scheduled at the earliest possible time. 
(d)  The city commission shall hold one public hearing unless additional hearings are required by general law, by its Charter or otherwise, at the earliest possible time. 
(e)  In cases in which the proposed moratorium involves less than five percent of the total land area of the city, the commission shall direct the city clerk to notify by mail each real property owner whose land will be under the moratorium and whose address is known by reference to the latest ad valorem tax records. The notice shall state the substance of the proposed moratorium as it affects that property owner and shall set a time and place for one or more public hearings on such moratorium. Such notice shall be given as quickly as practicable and a copy of such notice shall be kept in a separate book which shall be open to public inspection during the regular business hours of the office of the city clerk.

(2)  The required advertisements shall be no less than one-quarter page in a standard size or a tabloid size newspaper, and the headline in the advertisement shall be in a type no smaller than 18 point. The advertisement shall not be placed in that portion of the newspaper where legal notices and classified advertisements appear.

The advertisement shall be in the following form: 
"NOTICE OF PROPOSED MORATORIUM 
    The City of Hallandale Beach proposes to impose a moratorium upon the issuance of building permits within the area shown in the map in this advertisement. 
    A public hearing on the proposal will be held on (date and time) at Hallandale Beach City Hall." 
The advertisement shall also contain a geographic location map which clearly indicates the area covered by the proposed moratorium. The map shall include major street names as a means of identification of the area. 
(3)  In lieu of publishing the advertisement set out in this subsection, the city clerk may mail a notice to each person owning real property within the area to be covered by the moratorium. Such notice shall clearly explain the proposed moratorium and shall notify the person of the time, place and location of both public hearings on the proposed moratorium. 
(g)  At the public hearing, the city commission shall inquire into the necessity of a building moratorium and may, by resolution, reverse, modify or supersede any moratorium order previously issued. The commission's determination shall be predicated upon the reasonable necessity for a detailed comprehensive analysis of the areas in question and the probability of detriment to the character of the area by the continuation of the existing zoning districts. The commission shall take into account the existence or possible existence subsequent to development of the property as zoned, the following criteria: 
a.  The existence of schools. 
b.  Sufficiency of parks, open space and recreational facilities. 
c.  Effect upon streets and thoroughfares. 
d.  Availability and deficiency of public transportation facilities. 
e.  Effect upon air and/or water supplies.

(h)  Should the city commission, using the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, determine that a building moratorium is reasonably necessary, it shall, by resolution, order the moratorium and direct that no building permits be issued within the affected area. The commission's order shall fix a time within which the city manager shall report back to the commission with his recommendations relating to appropriate zoning districts and regulations for the affected area. This time limitation shall be a reasonable one, predicated upon the time needed for a comprehensive analysis of the area. 
(i)  If the city manager is unable to report back to the commission within the time prescribed by its moratorium order, upon timely request by the city manager and only after a duly advertised public hearing with notice as set forth in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, on the need for an extension, the commission may reasonably extend the time limitation. 
(j)  Upon notification by the city manager that he is prepared to submit his recommendations relating to the affected areas, the city commission shall call a public hearing at the earliest practicable time, after notice as set forth in subsections (e) and (f) of this section. After the public hearing has been closed, the commission may make its determination as to whether the zoning districts shall remain the same or whether hearings shall be held to consider rezoning. Should the commission determine that the zoning districts shall remain the same, it shall immediately issue its order terminating the building moratorium. Should the commission determine that hearings shall be held to consider rezoning of the property, or new districts created, it shall issue its order continuing the building moratorium and shall immediately initiate the actions required under the law, the Charter or this Code for such changes. 
(k)  Upon the completion of all zoning district changes relating to the affected areas, the commission shall issue its order terminating the building moratorium. 
(l)  Any resident or property owner of the city may, based upon the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, make written application to the city manager for issuance of an administrative order as provided in this section. If the city manager refuses to issue such order, or fails to take action on the order within 30 days, such person may make written application to the city commission for the issuance of a building moratorium by the commission. Such application to the commission shall be filed with the city clerk. The city manager, upon notice from the city clerk, shall place the matter before the city commission as soon as it is reasonably practicable for the commission's determination as to whether a public hearing shall be called. The term "resident or property owner," as used in this subsection, includes but is not limited to any individual, firm, corporation and governmental entity, including the planning and zoning board. 
(m)  Should the commission determine that one or more public hearings should be held as to whether a building moratorium should be imposed, it shall call the hearing for the earliest practicable date and give notice as set forth in subsections (e) and (f) of this section. Pending the public hearings, but using the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, the commission may issue an order prohibiting the issuance of building permits in the affected area. 
(n)  Notwithstanding the issuance of any moratorium order, the city commission may authorize the issuance of building permits for nondeleterious items, including but not limited to fences, repairs and like matters, remodeling or refurbishment of an existing single-family or duplex residential structure that does not involve a change in use, where the commission determines that such permit will not affect the outcome of the study, and where the work is done in accordance with all applicable ordinances and laws. 
(o)  During the existence of any building moratorium, no applications for variances, special exceptions or zoning district changes, within the affected area, shall be acted upon by any city department or board except as provided by the city commission in its moratorium resolution. 
(p)  If a building permit has been issued for any proposed building structure, or other improvement in an area of the city that is subsequently placed under a moratorium, pursuant to the terms of this section, and no actual construction or substantial land scarification has been initiated prior to the initial establishment of the moratorium, the permit shall be suspended at once. The city commission shall hold a public hearing as quickly thereafter as possible to determine what effect allowing the permitted construction to proceed will have on the study of the problems that necessitated the moratorium; and it shall decide whether to reinstate the permit, to modify the permit, or to continue the suspension of the permit for the term of the moratorium. Notice of the public hearing to the permittee shall be by personal service, if possible; and if personal service cannot be effectuated, it shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested. At the public hearing, the commission shall use the standards set forth in subsection (g) of this section, and it shall consider the time and expense actually incurred by the permittee in furtherance of its project. At the conclusion of the moratorium and based upon the findings of the commission, a public hearing may be conducted at the request of the permittee and the commission may revoke, reinstate or modify the suspended permit.

DIVISION 1. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 8-71. - General. 
(a)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the floodplain management ordinance of the City of Hallandale Beach, hereinafter referred to as "this article." 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. Where explicitly stated, this article shall apply to areas outside of flood hazard areas. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this article and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this article. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city commission or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2014-21, § 3, 6-4-2014; Ord. No. 2016-15, § 2, 8-17-2016) 
Sec. 8-72. - Applicability. 
(a)  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(b)  Areas to which this article applies. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this article shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the city, as established in section 8-72(c) of this article. 
(c)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Broward County, Florida and Incorporated Areas dated August 18, 2014, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this article and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the Building Division in City Hall, 400 South Federal Highway. 
(d)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 8-75 of this article the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this article and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(2)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(e)  Other laws. The provisions of this article shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this article and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This article shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this article. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(f)  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this article, provided the variance meets the requirements of section 8-77(d), is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(g)  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the city commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this article, and the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
(5)  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(h)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the city commission that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Sec. 8-185. - Designation process and criteria. 
(a)  Criteria. The board shall make recommendations to the city commission who shall have the authority to officially designate areas, places, buildings, structures, interiors, landscape features, archaeological sites, roadways, and other improvements or physical features as individual sites, districts or zones that are significant in the city's archaeology, architecture, culture, and human and natural history and that possess an integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship or association, or: 
(1)  Are associated with distinctive elements of the agricultural, architectural, artistic, cultural, economic, natural, political, prehistoric, religious, scientific, and social history that have contributed to the pattern of history in the city, the county, South Florida, the state, or the nation; 
(2)  Are associated with the lives of persons significant in the city's past; 
(3)  Embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, style, or method of construction or work of a master; or that possess high artistic value; or that represent a distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
(4)  Have yielded, or are likely to yield, information in history, prehistory, or paleontology. 
(b)  Properties not generally considered; exceptions. Certain properties, such as cemeteries, birthplaces, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, properties commemorative in nature, and properties not at least 50 years old, will not normally be considered for designation. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of sites, areas, periods, or districts that do meet the criteria, or if they fall within the following categories: 
(1)  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction of historic importance. 
(2)  A building or structure removed from its location but which is primarily significant for its architectural value, or is the surviving structure most importantly associated with an historic event, period, or person. 
(3)  A birthplace or grave of an historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building directly associated with his/her productive life. 
(4)  A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance such as original town settlers or early pioneers, distinctive design features, from age, or from association with historic events. 
(5)  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its historic significance. 
(6)  A property or district achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance. 
(c)  Investigation and designation report. Prior to the designation of an individual site, a district or a zone, an investigation and designation report must be filed with the board. The format of the designation report may vary according to the type of designation; however, all reports must address the following: 
(1)  The aesthetic, archaeological, architectural, cultural, historic, or paleontological significance of the property or properties being recommended for designation; 
(2)  A recommendation for boundaries for districts and zones and an identification of the boundaries of individual sites being designated; and 
(3)  If clearly specified, certain identifiable elements of a site, district, or zone may be exempt from the necessity of a certificate of appropriateness or a certificate to dig because of the particular circumstances of the property or properties to be designated. 
(4)  Properties previously designated by the Broward County Historical Commission, the state, or listed on the National Register of Historic Places may have those reports previously prepared adopted by the board as a city designation report. 
(d)  All reports shall take into consideration the effect of all projected, proposed, or existing public and private improvements and developmental or renewal plans on the integrity of the historic district or the integrity of archaeological or paleontological zones. 
(e)  Procedure. 
(1)  Petition of the owner. The owner or owners of any property or properties in the city may petition the board for designation of his or her property as an individual site, district, or zone provided that the owner(s) appears before the board with sufficient information to warrant the investigation of the property for future designation and the board finds that the property may be worthy of designation. The board shall, based upon its findings, direct the staff to begin the designation process. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to restrict the power of the board to initiate the designation process pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Directive of the board. The board shall, upon recommendations from staff, the city commission, the city manager or the acceptance of a petition pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of this section, direct staff to begin the designation process by preparing a designation report, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and any other standards and guidelines the board may deem necessary, and submitting the designation report according to the procedures described herein. 
(3)  Notification of owner. For each proposed designation of an individual site, a district, or a zone, the board is encouraged to obtain the permission of the property owner or owners within the proposed designation area, and is responsible for mailing a copy of the designation report to the owner or owners as notification of the Board's intent to consider designation of the proposed site, district, or zone at least 15 days prior to a public hearing held pursuant to this section. 
(4)  Notification of governmental agencies. Upon filing of a designation report, the staff of the board shall immediately notify the appropriate city departments, with building, demolition, environmental, planning, zoning, and public works powers that may be affected by said filing including but not limited to, the city manager, the building official, the director of development services, and the director of public works. 
(5)  Notification of a public hearing. For each individual site, district, or zone proposed for designation, a public board hearing must be held no sooner than 15 days and within 60 days from the date a designation report has been filed with the board. Owners of record or other parties having an interest in the property or properties proposed for designation, if known, shall be notified of the public hearing by U.S. mail to the last known address of the party being served; however, failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the same as such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the hearing. The required advertisements shall be no less than two columns wide by ten inches long in a standard-size or a tabloid-size newspaper, and the headline in the advertisement shall be in a type no smaller than 18 point. The advertisement shall not be placed in that portion of the newspaper where legal notices and classified advertisements appear. The advertisement shall be placed in a newspaper of general paid circulation in the city pursuant to F.S. ch. 50 and shall be published for at least five days. Owners shall be given an opportunity at the public hearing to object to the proposed designation. 
(6)  Courtesy letters. 
a.  All property owners within 150 feet of the individual site or district proposed for historic designation shall receive a courtesy notice indicating the following:

2.  Address and or legal description of property or properties to be designated; and 
3.  Place and times application can be reviewed. 
b.  The names of the property owners shall be as listed in the most current edition of the county tax rolls. Failure of a property owner to receive such courtesy notice shall not void any decision reached on the subject matter. 
c.  When a residential structure which contains a legally constituted homeowners' or condominium association is located within the distances in subsection (6)(a) of this section, a single notice transmitted to the current president or officer in charge shall satisfy the requirements for all property owners within the structure. 
(7)  Requirement of prompt decision and notification. The board's recommendation for designation shall be forwarded directly to the city commission for decision. The city commission shall by written resolution, state its decision to approve, deny, or amend the proposed designation. Upon designation, the city commission shall direct the city clerk to notify the following of its actions with a copy of the resolution: 
a.  The appropriate city agencies with building, demolition, environmental, planning, public works, and zoning powers that may be affected by this action including but not limited to, the city manager, the building official, the director of development services, and the director of public works; 
b.  The Broward County Historical Commission administrator; 
c.  The owner or owners of the affected property or properties and other parties having an interest in the property or properties, if known; and 
d.  The Broward County Property Appraiser.

(Ord. No. 2005-6, § 2, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 8-186. - Application for certificates of appropriateness and certificates to dig; demolition. 
(a)  Certificate required as prerequisite to alteration. No building, structure, interior, improvement, landscape feature or archaeological or paleontological site within the city that is designated pursuant to section 8-185 of this article shall be altered, constructed, demolished, excavated, moved, rehabilitated, renovated, or restored until an application for a certificate of appropriateness or certificate to dig has been submitted that describes the proposed alteration, construction, demolition, excavation, movement or removal, rehabilitation, renovation, or restoration, or other similar actions, has been submitted to and approved by the city commission or staff, where applicable, pursuant to the procedures in this section. No certificate of appropriateness or certificate to dig shall be approved unless architectural, engineering or other acceptable work plans for the proposed alteration, construction, demolition, excavation, movement or removal, rehabilitation, renovation, or restoration, or other similar actions, are approved by the board or staff pursuant to this section. 
(b)  Standards for issuance. The board shall make recommendations to the city commission from time to time to amend the standards by which applications for any certificate of appropriateness or certificate to dig are to be measured and evaluated. In adopting these guidelines, it is the intent of the board to promote the maintenance, restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, and adaptive reuses appropriate to a property or properties, and compatible contemporary designs that are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features and improvements of neighboring buildings, structures, sites, and streetscapes. These guidelines shall also serve as criteria for staff to make decisions regarding applications for regular certificates of appropriateness and certificates to dig. All certificates of appropriateness shall permit the staff to the board and the representatives of other appropriate governmental agencies to inspect from time to time any work approved pursuant to this section. 
(c)  Regular certificates of appropriateness. Based upon the criteria established in subsection (b) above and staff's review of the originally approved designation report, applications for a regular certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by a certified property survey, comprehensive, professionally prepared architectural plans and specifications including professionally prepared landscape plans, civil engineering plans, elevation drawings, material samples and any other information or articles deemed necessary by staff to fully describe the proposed alterations. The staff of the board shall, within 21 days from the date a complete application has been filed, approve or deny the application for a regular certificate of appropriateness by the owner or owners of a designated site or property within a district or zone. The findings of staff shall be sent by regular mail to the applicant within seven days of the staff decision, accompanied by a statement in full regarding the staff's decision. 
(d)  Special certificates of appropriateness. An applicant for a special certificate of appropriateness shall submit his or her application to the board accompanied with a certified property survey, comprehensive, professionally prepared architectural plans and specifications including professionally prepared landscape plans, civil engineering plans, structural engineering reports, elevation drawings, material samples and any other information or articles deemed appropriate by staff or the board to fully describe the proposed appearance, color, texture, or materials, and architectural design of the building and any courtyards, decorative stone, earthen mounds, exterior lighting, fences, gates, outbuildings, planters, plantings, shrubbery, sidewalks, signage, statuary, street furniture, trees, and walls or other structures or landscape features. 
(1)  The applicant shall provide adequate information to enable the board to visualize the effect of the proposed action on the applicant's property and adjacent properties and streetscapes. If such application involves a designated archaeological or paleontological zone, the applicant shall provide full plans and specifications of work that may affect the surface and subsurface of the zone. 
(2)  The board shall hold a public hearing upon an application for a special certificate of appropriateness affecting any city-designated site, district, or zone. In such instances, notice and procedure of the public hearing shall be given to the property owner or owners by certified mail and to other interested parties by an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the public hearing in accordance with section 8-185(e)(5) and (6) above. 
(3)  The board shall act upon an application within 60 days of receipt of application materials adequately describing the proposed action. The board shall recommend approval, denial, or recommend approval upon modification to the city commission, subject to the acceptance of the modification by the applicant, or suspend action on the application for a period not to exceed 31 days in order to seek technical advice from outside the board members, allow the applicant to reconsider and propose revisions or modifications to the application, or for staff to meet further with the applicant to revise or modify the application. 
(4)  The decision of the city commission shall be issued in writing. Evidence of approval of the application shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the city commission or the board's staff to the applicant and, whatever its decision, notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the appropriate city and county agencies with building, demolition, environmental, planning, public works, and zoning powers that may be affected by this action. When an application is denied, the city commission's notice shall provide an adequate written explanation of its decision to disapprove the application. 
(5)  Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing language of a particular certificate of appropriateness at the discretion of the city commission, both regular and special certificates of appropriateness shall expire after 365 days. Staff may grant extensions of time of up to an additional 180 days for restoration or rehabilitation work only upon satisfaction that the scope of the work originally approved has not changed and provided that a written request is filed and work is commenced before the expiration of the original certificate. 
(6)  Applications for special certificates of appropriateness involving demolition will require a structural report prepared by a licensed structural engineer. 
(e)  Certificates to dig. 
(1)  When required; how granted. A certificate to dig shall be required prior to the initiation of any proposal involving the excavation or in the event of any new construction, filling, digging, trenching, boring, tree or shrub removal, or any other activity that may alter or reveal surficial, embedded, or buried archaeological or paleontological material on a designated site or district. The procedure to obtain a certificate to dig shall be the same as indicated above for a special certificate of appropriateness and shall require city commission approval. 
(f)  Demolition. 
(1)  The demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement, site, district, or zone may not occur without the issuance of a special certificate of appropriateness, unless by a superseding order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(2)  The city's building official and the Unsafe Structures Board shall receive notice of designation of individual sites, districts, or zones pursuant to section 8-185. The staff of the Unsafe Structures Board shall consult with the staff of the Historic Preservation Board before entering a demolition order or placing such properties on an official agenda. The Unsafe Structures Board shall not enter a demolition order unless they first determine in writing that there exists no feasible alternative to demolition. 
(3)  The city commission and the Historic Preservation Board shall be deemed interested parties and shall receive ten days prior written notice of any public hearings conducted by the Unsafe Structures Board regarding the demolition of any designated property within the city. The city commission may make recommendations and suggestions to the Unsafe Structures Board and the property owner or owners relative to the feasibility of and the public interest in preserving the designated property. 
(4)  At the written request of the city commission, the Unsafe Structures Board shall continue any hearing on any designated property for not less than 30 days to allow consultation with the Historic Preservation Board and the city commission. If the Unsafe Structures Board subjects a designated property to an order providing for demolition, the order shall also, at the written request of the Historic Preservation Board, establish a grace period of no less than 120 days to obtain a permit to repair the property, followed by no less than 180 days to substantially complete such repairs. After entry of such a repair or demolition order, the Unsafe Structures Board shall have the jurisdiction and authority to grant additional extensions of the grace period, provided the agency is satisfied that the repair will be completed within a reasonable time. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Unsafe Structures Board from entering an order requiring a designated property to be secured. 
(5)  No permit for voluntary demolition of a designated building, structure, interior, improvement, landscape feature, zone, site, or other protected element of a property shall be issued to the owner or owners thereof until an application for a special certificate of appropriateness has been submitted and approved pursuant to the procedures in this section. Refusal by the city commission to grant a special certificate of appropriateness shall be evidenced by written order detailing the public interest which is sought to be preserved. The city commission shall be guided by the criteria contained in subsection (6) herein. The city commission may grant a special certificate of appropriateness that may provide for a delayed effective date for demolition. The effective date shall be determined by the city commission based upon the relative significance of the structure and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. During the demolition delay period, the city commission may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure concerned, in accordance with the purposes of this section. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, consultation with interested persons and private organizations, civic groups, and other public agencies, recommendations for acquisition of the property by public or private agencies or organizations, and exploration of the possibility of moving subject structures or other features. 
(6)  In addition to all other provisions of this section, the Historic Preservation Board and the city commission shall consider the following criteria in evaluating applications for demolition of designated properties: 
a.  Is the structure of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as an archaeological, architectural, or historical landmark? 
b.  Is the structure of such design, craftsmanship, or material that it could be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense? 
c.  Is the structure one of the last remaining examples of its kind within the city or county? 
d.  Does the structure contribute significantly to the historic character of a designated district? 
e.  Would retention of the structure promote the general welfare of the city by providing an opportunity for study of local history, architecture, or design or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture or heritage? 
f.  Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out and what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area? 
(7)  The loss of a designated structure or feature within the city, destroyed by fire, natural disaster, or other means may be corrected by efforts to reconstruct the resource. In the event a designated structure or feature is demolished illegally without a required special certificate of appropriateness, reconstruction shall be required. The board and the city commission shall be guided by, but not limited to the following: 
a.  Is there sufficient evidence (photodocumentation, drawings, and/or physical evidence) to accurately depict the form and detail of the original resource? 
b.  Are the original construction materials readily available, or are substitute materials sufficiently similar so as to convey the original qualities of construction? 
c.  Were the interior spaces designated or especially significant to the form and function of the building? If so, the board will define the parameters necessary to adequately convey those interior spatial characteristics as requirements in the reconstruction effort. 
d.  Has the applicant demonstrated a commitment to the reconstruction effort by making every reasonable effort to preserve or salvage the remaining features of the property? 
e.  Are there other unique factors or circumstances that would make reconstruction desirable? 
The applicant for the reconstruction effort shall provide the board and the city commission with details of the construction project, to include a description of the existing character of the site, and whether or not there is any salvage potential. Every reasonable effort shall be made to incorporate salvaged elements within the reconstructed historic resource. 
(g)  Building permit not to issue without a certificate. No building or other permit that affects any designated property within the city shall be issued by any city, county, or state agency without an approved certificate of appropriateness or certificate to dig. 
(h)  Compliance of work with certificate standards; official and staff. All work performed pursuant to the issuance of any certificate shall conform to the requirements of the certificate. The city manager shall hire an historic preservation professional or designate an appropriate city staff member, along with any other necessary city staff, to assist by making necessary inspections in connection with enforcement of this section and shall be empowered to issue a stop work order if performance is not in accordance with the issued certificate. No work shall proceed as long as a stop work order continues in effect. Copies of inspection reports shall be furnished to the city commission and copies of any stop work orders shall be furnished to both the city commission and the applicant. The official selected by the city manager as staff for the board shall be responsible for ensuring that any work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness or other provisions of this ordinance shall be corrected to comply with the certificate or provision prior to withdrawing the stop work order. 
(i)  Emergency and temporary measures. For the purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property, nothing contained herein shall prevent the making of any temporary construction, reconstruction, or other necessary repairs to a designated building or site within the city, pursuant to an order of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(1)  The owner of any designated property damaged by storm, fire or other calamity shall be permitted to stabilize the building immediately without board approval and to repair, restore, reconstruct, or rehabilitate the property later under the normal review procedures to this section. 
(j)  No action to constitute approval. If no action upon a completed application is taken within 60 days from the date of its receipt, such application shall be deemed to have been approved and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. This time limit may be waived by mutual written consent of the applicant and the city commission. 
(k)  Power of review. The board shall have the authority to review and make recommendations on applications for certificates and the city commission shall have the authority to approve or deny applications for certificates of all property within the city, however owned, by either public or private parties. The purposes of this section shall apply equally to plans, projects, or work executed or assisted by any private party, governmental body or agency, department, authority or commission or board of the city, county, or state. 
(l)  Archaeological sites or districts. To protect a designated archaeological site, district, or zone (hereinafter "site"), the board may require any of the following: 
(1)  An archaeological survey at the applicant's expense conducted by a qualified archaeologist approved by the board containing an assessment of the significance of the archaeological site and an analysis of the impact of the proposed activity on the site; 
(2)  Scientific excavation as an evaluation of the site at the applicant's expense by a qualified, professional archaeologist; 
(3)  Mitigation measures to offset any potential detrimental effects from activities affecting the site; 
(4)  Protection or preservation of all or part of the archaeological site for green space; and 
(5)  Request the oversight, technical guidance, or intervention of the Broward County Historical Commission, as appropriate. The board may also require an archaeological survey or scientific excavation as a precondition to consider further action. 
(Ord. No. 2005-6, § 2, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 8-187. - Standards for archaeological work; discovery of archaeological sites. 
(a)  Archaeological work. Archaeological surveys, assessments, excavations, and other work required by this section shall be conducted by a qualified, professional archaeologist and be consistent with the guidelines for such work consistent with accepted professional standards and regulations developed by the Florida Department of State Office of Cultural and Historic Properties and the U.S. Department of the Interior, or their successor agencies. 
(b)  Sites discovered during the development process. In the event that archaeological materials are discovered by ground-disturbing activities on any property within the city, such activities in the immediate vicinity of the archaeological site shall be discontinued and board notified. The board shall review the site of the discovery and may require that the site be assessed by a qualified professional archaeologist at the expense of the property owner. 
(c)  Unmarked human graves. If a discovery is made on any property within the city of an unmarked human grave or graves, then the procedures for notifying the state archaeologist and county medical examiner shall be followed, consistent with F.S. ch. 872, as amended. The disposition of the remains and the preservation of the burial site shall be determined consistent with state law and with the advice and consent of the board. 
(Ord. No. 2005-6, § 2, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 8-188. - Maintenance of designated properties; demolition by neglect prohibited. 
(a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Nothing in this section shall prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any interior or exterior elements of any building or structure that does not involve a change of design, appearance or material, and which does not require a building permit or certificate of appropriateness for demolition. 
(b)  Affirmative maintenance required. The owner of a property designated pursuant to this section either individually or as a contributing part of a district or zone shall comply with all applicable codes, laws and regulations governing the maintenance of property. It is the intent of this section to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect the exterior features of such properties and the interior portions thereof when maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the property. All such properties shall be preserved against such decay and deterioration and shall be free from structural defects through prompt corrections of any of the following defects: 
(1)  Facades that fall and injure the subject property, adjoining property, or members of the public; 
(2)  Deteriorated or inadequate foundations, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls or other vertical structural supports; 
(3)  Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports or other structural members that may rot, sag, split or buckle due to defective material or deterioration; 
(4)  Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations or floors, including broken, unsecured or missing windows or doors; or 
(5)  Any fault or defect in the property that renders it structurally unsafe, insufficiently protected from weathering, or not properly watertight. 
(c)  Undue economic hardship. Where, by reason of particular site conditions and restraints, or because of unusual circumstances applicable solely to the particular applicant's property, strict enforcement of the provisions of this section would result in serious undue economic hardship to the applicant, the city commission shall have the power to vary or modify adherence to this section; provided always that its requirements ensure harmony with the general purposes hereof and will not adversely affect the city. 
(d)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Notice of administrative enforcement. When a city code compliance specialist or building inspector determines a violation of subsection (b) above, chapter 14 of this Code, or any other code violation, that officer or inspector shall provide written notice of the violation to the owner in writing in accordance with section 14-84 and/or 14-85 of this Code. The property owner shall be granted a reasonable amount of time to perform the corrective action per section 14-84 and/or 14-85 of this Code. Upon neglect, refusal, or failure to comply, the code compliance specialist or building inspector may pursue Code Enforcement Board or Unsafe Structure Board action in accordance with section 14-84 and/or 14-85 of this Code. 
(2)  Action for injunction and remedial relief; lien on property. If the property owner fails to take corrective action pursuant to a final order issued by the Code Enforcement Board or the Unsafe Structures Board, the city may file liens against the property pursuant to sections 14-85 and 14-86 of this Code. 
The city may also file an action seeking: (1) An injunction ordering the property owner to take corrective action; (2) An order authorizing the city to enter onto the property to make corrective actions; and (3) civil penalties. 
The court shall order an injunction providing such remedies if the city proves that the owner has violated this section and such violation threatens the integrity or existence of an individual site or a contributing structure within a district. Such civil action may be initiated in the name of the city at the discretion of the city manager upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the city commission. 
Settlements of such lawsuits may be obtained in the same manner. Nothing herein shall prevent the city commission from initiating or assuming direction of the lawsuit, at its discretion. In the event that the court authorizes the city to enter onto the property to take required corrective action, the court shall also order that the cost of the corrective action shall constitute a lien against the property, accruing interest at the statutory rate for judgments until satisfied. 
(3)  Civil penalties. Violation of this section shall be punished by a civil penalty of $500.00. After expiration of the reasonable time period provided in subsection (d)(1), each day that the corrective action is not taken shall constitute a separate violation.

(d)  All relevant evidence shall be admitted if, in the opinion of the special magistrate, it is the type of evidence upon which reasonable and responsible persons would normally rely in the conduct of business affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make such evidence inadmissible over objections in civil actions. The special magistrate may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. 
(e)  Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but such hearsay evidence shall not, in and of itself, be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision. 
(f)  Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross examine opposing witnesses, impeach witnesses and rebut evidence.

Sec. 13-68. - Declaration of public nuisance. 
    Shopping carts that have been removed from the premises of businesses and left abandoned on public or private property throughout the city constitute a public nuisance and a potential hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the public. They create conditions of blight in the community, obstruct free access to sidewalks, streets and other public rights-of-way, interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, impede emergency services, and create impediments to the flow of water in drainage systems and other waterways when abandoned within drainage culverts and easements. It is for these reasons such lost, stolen, or abandoned shopping carts are hereby declared to be a public nuisance which shall be subject to abatement in the manner set forth in this article, or as provided by law.

The shopping cart retrieval plan shall identify the number of employees who will be assigned such cart retrieval duties, the number of total hours per week that each assigned employee will perform such retrievals, and extent of training each of such personnel has received or will receive concerning the retrieval of lost, stolen or abandoned shopping carts. The shopping cart retrieval plan shall include a copy of each contract with a cart retrieval service or indicate that the cart retrieval will be performed in-house. The shopping cart retrieval plan shall identify the streets and bus stops which will be patrolled as required by this article as well as the manner, frequency, and times of such patrols. 
    Based on the above referenced criteria, the city shall approve, reject or modify a plan, within 30 days of when the plan is submitted. If the plan is approved, the proposed measures shall be implemented no later than 30 days after approval. If the plan is rejected, the retail establishment shall modify the plan and re-submit it to the city no later than 30 days after the date of its rejection. 
    Following the approval of a plan, a retail establishment may file a written request with the city manager to amend its plan. The proposed amended plan is subject to the same criteria and review process as an original plan.

(1)  Establishing minimum standards governing the condition, occupancy and maintenance of vacant and occupied residential and nonresidential buildings, structures and premises; 
(2)  Establishing minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and other physical components and conditions essential to make such buildings, structures and premises safe, sanitary and fit for human habitation; 
(3)  Fixing certain responsibilities and duties of owners, operators, agents and occupants of such buildings, structures and premises; 
(4)  Authorizing and establishing procedures for the inspection of vacant and occupied residential and nonresidential buildings, structures and premises and the condemnation and vacation of those residential and nonresidential buildings, structures and premises unfit for human habitation or occupancy; and 
(5)  Prohibiting human habitation in vacant buildings and structures found unsafe and ordered secured. 
(b)  The standards, provisions and requirements contained in this chapter are deemed to further the goals, objectives and policies contained in the city's comprehensive plan.

(c)  It is also the intent of the city that the maximum possible number of safe, adequate and affordable housing units and nonresidential structures in the city are kept available by encouraging and requiring that vacant units be reconditioned and made fit for occupancy rather than permitting them to be abandoned or neglected, thereby removing them from the housing market and commercial real estate market. 
(d)  It is also the intent of this chapter to establish minimum standards which shall govern upkeep, maintenance, rehabilitation, repair or improvement of all buildings and structures within the city limits. Standards shall regulate, govern and be binding on the owner/occupant to ensure that minimum maintenance of both structures and premises shall be met. Such maintenance standards shall apply to the exterior and interior of all structures.

(3)  No person shall occupy or let to another for occupancy such a posted building or structure except as provided for in this article. If the dwelling or structure is occupied at the time of the posting, the dwelling or structure must be vacated within 24 hours unless otherwise prescribed by the city official for good and sufficient reasons after the notice is posted. The owner shall immediately begin action to vacate the structure or to bring it into compliance within the time prescribed. 
(4)  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or deface the placard which has been posted on an unsafe or unfit dwelling or structure, and the placard shall remain until such time as the city official requires the placard to be removed. 
(5)  If, after inspection, the city official determines that the dwelling or structure is uninhabited, the city official shall cause to be posted a "No Trespassing" sign to prevent entry into the premises by third parties who might be exposed to the risk of danger created by the unsafe structure. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or deface the "No Trespassing" sign, and it shall remain until such time as the city official requires it to be removed. 
(6)  All structures that meet any of the criteria from subsection (c)(1) above and have been posted with the requisite notice, must be approved by the building division based upon all of the following inspections before the structure can be deemed safe for use: 
a.  An electrical inspection by a state certified electrician; 
b.  A plumbing inspection by a state licensed plumber; and

d.  An inspection by a state licensed structural engineer; and 
e.  An inspection by a state certified pest control operator. 
Upon completion of the inspections described herein, an inspection report shall be filed with the building division for approval. The building official shall prescribe the forms to be used for the inspections described herein and shall be authorized to charge a fee for the review of the inspection reports. Each inspection report shall certify that there is currently no unsafe, hazardous, or unsanitary conditions currently existing in the structure, all building code violations corrected and the structure is safe for occupancy. No building deemed unsafe pursuant to this section shall be occupied until the results from the required inspections have been reviewed, and all permits have been obtained to bring the structure back into compliance with the building code. Nothing herein shall relieve the owner from the requirement to obtain permits for any repairs required to meet the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Unsafe structures meeting criteria for immediate demolition. 
(1)  The provisions below shall apply to buildings or structures meeting the criteria for immediate demolition. 
(2)  The building official shall prepare a notice of violation. The notice shall state in summary form the nature of the defects which constitute a violation of this article and shall order the structure to be demolished within such time as is reasonable, subject to extension when requested in writing within the reasonable discretion of the building official. The notice shall state that the specific details concerning the violations can be obtained in writing from the building official upon request. In addition, the notice will explain the right of appeal of the decision of the building official to the unsafe structures board, in its appellate capacity, and advise that unless the decision is appealed, the building or structure shall be demolished without further notice. 
(3)  The notice of violation shall be affixed to the structure concerned. The building official shall also affix to the structure notice of the hearing of the unsafe structures board scheduled to consider any appeal of the decision of the building official in connection with the structure. The notice of hearing shall be issued by the director of the building and code compliance department or his designee for appeals to an unsafe structures board advising persons to appear before the board to show cause why the decision of the building official should not be carried out. The hearing shall be scheduled at the next available unsafe structures board hearing to ratify the action. 
(4)  Within ten working days of posting the notice of violation and notice of hearing, the building official shall send written notice of violation and notice of hearing to the owner and any interested party. For these purposes, the owner shall be the taxpayer as reflected in the most recently certified real property ad valorem tax roll of Broward County; provided however, where the records of the Broward County Property Appraiser indicate that ownership has changed, the owner shall be the taxpayer as reflected in those records. An interested party shall be the owner and any other person or entity who has previously requested real property ad valorem tax notices with respect to the subject property in accordance with Florida Statutes, as the same may be renumbered or amended from time to time. The notice of violation and notice of hearing shall be sent by certified or first class mail to all such parties' last known addresses as reflected in the records of the Broward County Property Appraiser. Failure to receive such notice or the lack of a signed return receipt shall not invalidate the notice. 
(5)  Upon expiration of the period of appeal provided in the notice of violation, the building official may file an appropriate instrument in the office of the clerk of the circuit court to be recorded in the public records of this county, indicating that the property is in violation of the building code. The recording of the notice shall constitute constructive notice of the violation to all concerned, subsequent purchasers, transferees, mortgagees, lessees, grantees and all persons claiming or acquiring interest in the property. In the event that the violation is corrected, the building official shall file proof of the same upon payment for fees incurred. 
(6)  The building official shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for two consecutive weeks. The published notice shall contain the address of the subject property and the names of the owner and any interested party, and state that the subject property has been found to be in violation of the building code and subject to demolition. The published notice shall also state the time and place of the hearing scheduled before the unsafe structures board. 
(7)  The notices provided in this section are intended to serve as full and effective notice of the hearing and the violations related to the structure. Failure of one form of notice shall not invalidate or impair the full effectiveness of notice provided by other means pursuant to this section. 
(c)  Unsafe structures not meeting the valuation criteria for immediate demolition. 
(1)  If a building or structure may be repaired and made safe pursuant to the valuation criteria set forth above, and the building or structure is otherwise unsafe in accordance with the physical criteria set forth in this section, the building official may order such building or structure to be temporarily secured in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter. Such building must be completed and brought into full compliance with the building code within such time as the building official or the unsafe structures board may determine to be reasonable for such completion. If the building or structure is not temporarily secured, or once served, not completed and brought into compliance with the building code within the reasonable periods allowed, such building or structure shall be demolished and removed from the premises. 
(2)  The building official shall prepare a notice of violation. This written notice shall state in summary form the nature of defects which constitute a violation of this section and shall prescribe the action to be taken to comply and the time within which compliance must be accomplished, in such time not to exceed ten days to secure an open structure to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official, 90 days to obtain permits to repair the structure, and 120 days to bring it into compliance with the building code. This notice shall also state that the specific details concerning the violations can be obtained in writing from the building official on request. In addition, this notice will explain the right of appeal of the decision of the building official to the unsafe structures board, in its appellate capacity and also advise that unless there is compliance with the directions of the building official, a case will be commenced before the unsafe structures after time for compliance has expired, or that the building official's order will be enforced. 
(3)  The notice of violation shall be affixed to the structure concerned. 
(4)  Within ten working days of posting the notice of violation, the building official shall send the written notice of violation to the owner and any interested party, in the same manner provided in subsection (2) above. 
(5)  In the event that the building or structure is not secured or brought into compliance with the requirements of the building code within the periods specified in the notice of violation, and no application for extension is made in the manner set forth in this section, the building official may schedule the case for hearing before the unsafe structures board to secure an order for demolition of the building or structure or to obtain any other appropriate remedy. 
(6)  In the event that the building official schedules a hearing, or in the event that the owner or interested party files a timely appeal of the decision of the building official, the building official, or his or her designee shall issue a notice of hearing which shall be affixed to the property, mailed to the owner and interested party, in the same manner provided in subsection (g) above. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the same manner provided in subsection (g) above. 
(7)  Upon expiration of the period of appeal provided in the notice of violation, if the property has not been secured or permits for repair obtained in the manner stipulated in the notice, the building official may file an appropriate instrument in the public records in the manner provided in subsection (g) above. 
(8)  The periods set forth in the notice of violation for bringing the structure into compliance with the building code may be extended by the building official for one or more additional periods which in the aggregate do not exceed an additional 180 days, provided all of the conditions of this subsection are met. Application for the extension must be made in writing by the interested party to the building official prior to the expiration of the period allowed for compliance, and shall set forth to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official that the extension is warranted by one or more of the following circumstances: 
a.  The interested party has a demonstrated financial hardship that will prevent the interested party from completing a building or structure; 
b.  The interested party has filed a completed zoning hearing application which affects the final completion of the building or structure and which zoning hearing request has not received final approval or rejection from the city or applicable governmental agency, including any or all appeals to court, for circumstances outside of the control for the interested party; 
c.  The building or structure is a multiple dwelling structure as defined in the building code and demolition of any unit comprising that structure compromises the structural integrity of the entire multi-unit structure, where the completion of the structure is outside of the control of the interested party; 
d.  The building or structure is the subject of pending litigation that renders it impossible for the building or structure to be completed; 
e.  The building or structure is the subject of a good faith insurance claim, the proceeds of which are intended to be utilized for repair and completion; 
f.  The building or structure is the subject of a pending sale to be closed within a reasonable time from the date the extension is requested, where the buyer has executed a written commitment to the building official to complete the structure within the applicable extension period. 
The written application for extension shall further represent to the building official that the building or structure is and has at all times been in full compliance with all of the conditions set forth in this subsection. 
(9)  Upon receipt of the written application, the building official shall be authorized to extend the date of full completion and compliance with the building code provided: 
a.  The completed written application demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official that one or more of the conditions set forth above exist with respect to the building or structure; 
b.  The building or structure is not open, vacant or abandoned, having been secured at doors and windows in a manner acceptable to the building official; and 
c.  The interested party has paid all reasonable costs of enforcement. 
(10)  Any interested party may appeal to the unsafe structures board a decision to grant or deny the extension. Such appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of mailing of the building official's written notice of his or her decision with respect to the application for extension. 
(d)  Public hearing. 
(1)  On the day established in the notice of public hearing the unsafe structures board shall review all pertinent evidence and hear all testimony from the building official, the owner and other parties in interest and their respective witnesses. 
(2)  The unsafe structures board may order repair, securing, and/or demolition of the structure upon application of the standards set forth in this article. The unsafe structures board may modify, rescind, or uphold the decision of the building official as recited in the notice of violation. The unsafe structures board shall modify or rescind a decision of the building official only upon a finding that the building official was in error in the interpretation or application of the building code. The unsafe structures board shall not exceed the time frames allowed for repair and completion of buildings and structures specifically set forth in this article, except where the work involved reasonably requires such additional time. 
(3)  The board's order shall be filed as a lien against the property. A copy of the order shall be forwarded to the owner, and all interested parties by registered or certified mail, and a copy thereof posted on the property. 
(4)  If the owner or interested party fails to comply with the order of the unsafe structures board within the time stipulated therein and such order is to repair, complete or secure the building to make safe, then the building official shall cause such building to be vacated, if occupied; and shall through his employees or through a contractor enforce the order of the unsafe structures board or building official. Buildings shall be secured with concrete block or other materials of the same durability as determined by the building official. Swimming pools shall be secured by fencing or by using another approved method as determined by the building official. 
(5)  If the order of the unsafe structures board is to demolish the building or structure and to remove or salvage contents, debris and abandoned property from the premises, and the owner or those responsible shall have failed to comply with such order, then the building official may do so.

(e)  Multi-unit structures. 
(1)  This subsection shall be applicable to all multi-unit structures. As used in this subsection, the term multi-unit structures means all townhouses and other structures which contain units divided by one or more common walls, where the structural integrity of any component unit depends upon the structural integrity of one or more other units in the same structure. In the event that the owner or other interested party fails to comply with any order of the unsafe structures board in connection with any multi-unit structure, then in addition to any other right or remedy contained in this section, the city shall be authorized, but not required, to secure the structure in the manner set forth in this subsection. In addition, and not in derogation of the use of other methods contemplated by this section for enforcing the building code with respect to any structure, multi-unit structures may be secured by performing whatever work the building official may determine is reasonably necessary to preserve the structural integrity, water-tightness, or safety of adjacent units or the surrounding community which work may include, but not be limited to, roofing, windows, and electrical. 
(2)  The procedure for enforcement of this Code set forth above shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, other procedures available to the building official pursuant to the building code. The provisions of this subsection are not intended to exonerate any owner or other interested party from compliance with the building code or any order of an unsafe structures board. 
(f)  Recovery of cost. 
(1)  All costs incurred pursuant to any of the provisions of this section shall be paid by the owner, interested party, or occupant of the premises on which the violation occurred. 
(2)  The building official shall file among his or her records an affidavit stating with fairness and accuracy the items of expense and the date of execution of actions authorized by this article. 
(3)  Any other employee, official or agency who incurs costs while executing any provision within this article shall create an affidavit stating with fairness and accuracy the items of expense and the date of execution of actions authorized by this section. That affidavit shall be given to the building official responsible for the unsafe structure at issue and filed among his or her records for that property. 
(4)  After three months from the date of filing any liens that remain unpaid, the city may institute a suit in accordance with Florida Statutes to recover such expenses against any liable person or may cause such expenses to be charged against the property on which the violation occurred as a lien or as a special assessment lien collectible according to established procedures. 
(5)  Liens created pursuant to this section may be discharged and satisfied by paying to the city the amount specified in the notice of lien, together with interest thereon from the date of the filing of the lien computed at the rate of 12 percent per annum, together with the administrative costs, filing and recording fees and fees paid to file a satisfaction of the lien in the public records. When any such lien has been discharged, the city shall promptly cause evidence of the satisfaction and discharge of such lien to be recorded in the public records. 
(6)  The remedies and procedures for recovery of costs provided in this article shall be in addition to and not in derogation of other [costs] provided in the building code or otherwise provided by law.

(5)  Requests for extensions of time. Any owner or authorized representative may seek an extension of the timeframes set forth in an order of the unsafe structures board. Such request for a hearing to seek such extension must be in writing, directed to the unsafe structures board. The unsafe structures board shall not be authorized to extend any deadline for compliance, set forth in the order, unless the secretary of the unsafe structures board receives the written request for extension prior to the deadline specified in the initial order.

To obtain an extension, the owner or applicant must demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the unsafe structures board that the structure that is the subject of the order is secure at the time the extension is sought and that the owner or applicant has made a good faith attempt to comply with the order which has been impeded by changed circumstances or other circumstances outside of the owner or applicant's control. As a further condition of the extension, the owner or applicant must submit in writing, together with the petition for an extension, a written timetable for compliance with the substantive provisions of the order and for completion of all necessary repairs.

Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to an appellate review of the record created before the board. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the written order to which the appeal is directed.

(b)  Applications for a permit for relief from the noise level designated in this section as unlawful, on the basis of undue hardship, may be made to the city manager. Any permit granted by the city manager shall contain all conditions upon which the permit has been granted and shall specify a reasonable time that such permit shall be effective. The city manager may grant such a permit if he finds that additional time is necessary for the applicant to alter or modify his activity or operation to comply with this section; or that the activity, operation or noise source will be of temporary duration and cannot be accomplished without exceeding the noise level provided in this section; and that no other reasonable alternative is available to the applicant; and the city manager has prescribed such conditions or requirements deemed necessary to minimize adverse effects upon the community and the surrounding neighborhood.

(a)  For purposes of this section, the term "definition of anti-Semitism" includes the following: 
(1)  Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, or toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. 
(2)  Examples of anti-Semitism include: 
a.  Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion); 
b.  Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions; 
c.  Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the state of Israel, or even for acts committed by non-Jews; 
d.  Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust; or 
e.  Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations. 
(3)  Examples of anti-Semitism related to Israel include: 
a.  Demonizing Israel by using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism to characterize Israel or Israelis, drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, or blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions; 
b.  Applying a double standard to Israel by requiring behavior of Israel that is not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or focusing peace or human rights investigations only on Israel; or 
c.  Delegitimizing Israel by denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist. 
d.  However, criticism of Israel similar to that levied against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic. 
(b)  In investigating whether there has been a violation of law, the city police department shall take into consideration the definition of anti-Semitism for purposes of determining whether the alleged violation was motivated by anti-Semitic intent, consistent with the federal and state statutes prohibiting hate crimes. 
(c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or the State of Florida's Constitution. Nothing in this section may be construed to conflict with federal or state discrimination laws.

ARTICLE II. - JUVENILE CURFEW[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Juvenile curfew, F.S. §§ 877.20-877.25. 

Sec. 19-51. - Short title and applicability. 
(a)  This article may be cited as the "City of Hallandale Beach Juvenile Curfew Ordinance." 
(b)  The provisions of this article are declared to have citywide effect. 
(Code 1980, § 19-32) 
Sec. 19-52. - Legislative intent, findings and purposes. 
(a)  The city commission finds and determines that the city is facing a mounting crisis caused by increasing crime, including juvenile crime and delinquency which threatens peaceful citizens, residents and visitors. The commission further determines that this criminal activity, both individually and collectively, presents a clear and present danger to the citizenry and to the public order and safety. The economic cost of crime in the city continues to drain existing resources. Additionally, the effect on victims, both economic and psychological, is traumatic and tragic. 
(b)  The city commission finds that fighting crime effectively requires a multipronged effort, with one aspect focusing on those age groups particularly vulnerable to and injured by crime, and susceptible to being induced into committing crime. Consequently, it is the intent of the commission to create and implement a juvenile curfew program aimed at protecting juveniles from crime and reducing juvenile crime and the direct and indirect consequences of juvenile crime. 
(c)  Juveniles in the city have themselves become victims of crime and violence in steadily increasing numbers. Violent crimes against juveniles in the city are dramatically high in number, and the psychological effect of crime committed upon juveniles is particularly tragic and traumatic. A juvenile curfew program would have the additional benefit of reducing juvenile victimization. 
(d)  It is the intent of this commission to substantially reduce, if not eradicate, acts of crime and delinquency committed by juveniles and to provide for the care, safety and protection of law abiding juveniles and other citizens, residents and visitors. 
(e)  This article is enacted in recognition of the peculiar vulnerability of juveniles, their frequent inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner, and the importance of the parental role in child-rearing. 
(f)  The purposes of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect juveniles themselves and other citizens, residents and visitors of the city from the dangers of crimes which occur on sidewalks, streets and in public, and semipublic places during late night and early morning hours. 
(2)  Decrease the amount of criminal activity engaged in by juveniles. 
(3)  Promote and enhance parental control over juveniles.

Sec. 19-81. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around a public or private school, designated public or private school bus stop, day care center, public park or public playground, wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

(b)  The above prohibition shall apply to individuals who have either pled no contest or pled guilty; or who have been found guilty of a violation of an equivalent offense to F.S. §§ 794.011, 800.04, 827.071, or 847.0145, within any state of the U.S. or any foreign nation, provided, however, a person referenced in the foregoing sentence and residing within 2,500 feet of any school, designated public or private school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, does not commit a violation of this section if:

(d)  Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

(d)  The provisions and procedures contained in this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to any other remedies now existing or subsequently provided for by law, regarding violations of municipal ordinances. 
(e)  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from enforcing its ordinances by any other means; including but not limited to enforcement in any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any other enforcement procedure available under F.S. ch. 162, or as provided in this Code or by law.

Sec. 21-152. - Eligible registers. 
(a)  From the results of each examination, the human resources department shall prepare and keep open for public inspection an eligible register for the persons who have obtained the minimum passing grade, and who are otherwise qualified for appointment. Eligible applicants shall be notified of their rating and shall take rank on the eligible register in the order of their relative grades, beginning with the highest rating (subject to the veterans' preference rules being complied with). 
(b)  Whenever it becomes necessary to hold another similar examination in order to obtain additional eligibles, the civil service board shall establish a new register by consolidating the existing register and by rearranging the names on the register according to their grades. All persons whose names appear on an existing register which is to be merged with a new register shall have an opportunity to compete in the second examination. Should such persons elect to refuse reexamination, their names shall remain on the new register for a period of one year from the date the original register was approved by the board. Should they elect to be reexamined, the grade earned on the latter examination shall be their official grade without regard to their previous grade and will remain on the new register for a period of one year from the date the new scores are approved by the board. 
(c)  The term of eligibility of each register shall be one year. The term of the eligibility register may be extended for an additional one-year period upon request of the human resources department and approval of the board. 
(d)  The name of any person appearing on an eligible register may be removed for the following reasons: 
(1)  By appointment to the position for which the register is established. 
(2)  By written request. 
(3)  By failure to report or arrange for an interview with the appointing authority within three working days after the time of notification of certification.

(5)  By declining an appointment without satisfactory explanation to the human resources department. 
(6)  By failure to be selected as provided for in this article. 
(7)  By becoming incapacitated or unfit for appointment.

If the person shall fail to appear at the hearing when set by the board, the name of the person shall be removed from the eligible register. 
(f)  Every person on the eligible register shall file with the human resources department written notice of any change of address. Failure to do so may justify removal of their name from the eligible register. 
(g)  When an eligible certified for appointment shall fail to accept the offer made by mail or otherwise within four working days after receipt of the notice of appointment, he shall be deemed to have declined the appointment and his name shall be removed from the eligible register. If, however, it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the board, within 30 days after giving such notice, that the person was unavoidably and without fault on their part prevented from accepting the appointment, the name may be restored to its proper position on the eligible register. When an eligible certified for permanent employment refuses twice to accept a position, his name shall be removed from the eligible register. 
(h)  No person whose name is on the eligible register may waive his right to certification or appointment without being removed from the register except for the following reason, stated in writing to the board: temporary inability, physical or otherwise, to accept the position offered. The proof of this temporary inability must be acceptable to the board. The board shall then enter upon its minutes the reason for its action in each case described in this subsection, and the waiver shall not continue in effect for a longer period than 30 days from the date of certification without a special vote of the board. The appointing department shall forward to the board, with the notice of appointment, copies of all correspondence to and from the person declining the appointment pursuant to this subsection. 
(i)  An eligible register may be revoked and another examination ordered when the board shall deem it advisable either because of errors discovered, fraud committed, or inappropriate standards prescribed for any examination. All persons named on the revoked register shall be given the opportunity to take the next examination for establishing a new register. No existing eligible register shall be altered or revoked except by action of the board.

(b)  Vacancies in higher positions in the classified service shall be filled by promotion or advancement of employees, qualified by examination, from the lower classifications of the same group. Whenever the human resources department may determine that no employees from the lower classification in the same group are qualified to take a promotional examination or if no person passes the examination to fill a promotional position, then, in either case, such higher position shall be filled as an entrance position, under the provisions of this article. 
(c)  In the event of a position's being reaudited at the request of the director of a department, where the reaudit shows the duties and responsibilities of the position to be higher than the present classification, the employee shall be advanced to the new classification and pay range with the approval of the city manager and provided the following conditions are found by the human resources department: 
(1)  The employee has developed the position into a higher classification because of his initiative and ability to assume more important and complex duties and responsibilities. 
(2)  The employee has been in the position for at least one year and holds permanent status in the classification allotted to the position. 
(d)  An emergency, interim or temporary appointment from a lower to a higher position made necessary by reason of illness, disability or other cause for absence of the regular employee may be authorized without examination by the human resources department upon written request, with full information from the department director. Such promotions will terminate with the return of the regular employee, and all circumstances shall be recorded by the human resources department. No seniority rights in the higher position shall accrue to the temporarily promoted employee.

Sec. 21-182. - Promotional examinations. 
(a)  The term "promotional examination" signifies fitness tests to determine the relative standing of current employee applicants for positions in a specified class. A promotional examination may include employees in specified classes in all departments, or only in the department for which the eligible register is being established, as determined by the human resources department. 
(b)  Promotional examinations shall be competitive and open only to permanent employees legally appointed in the classified service as established by the city commission and administered by the civil service board and who meet the minimum experience qualifications as determined by the human resources department. The only exception to this subsection is that employees will not be eligible to participate in a promotional examination who have, within the six months' period immediately preceding the date of the examination, failed to obtain a passing grade in an examination for the same or a like position. This exception may be waived by the board upon application of a department director in those instances in which all eligible candidates have failed an examination. 
(c)  Examinations for promotions shall be conducted as often as is necessary. Notices shall be posted in the human resources department in the municipal complex and sent to all department heads in a sufficient amount of time prior to the date of the examination. 
(d)  Each eligible applicant who cares to compete for promotion must fill out the prescribed application or promotion form and present it to the human resources department on or before the closing date specified in the official announcement of the examination. The applicant must be able to read and write and must fill out his own application form unless the human resources department decides that such abilities are not necessary to properly perform the duties of the higher position. 
(e)  All promotional examinations shall be practical in character and shall relate directly to matters which will fairly test the relative capacity of the person examined to discharge the particular duties of the class of position to which promotion is desired. The promotional examination shall consist of one or more of the following parts as defined in this article: mental test, written test, performance test, oral interview, physical test, and medical examination.

Seniority credits in the permanent civil service classification held by such employee shall accrue to the employee while assigned to such noncivil service employment. A probationary employee who has been appointed to a position not under civil service may accrue civil service credits with the approval of the civil service board. Application for such rights must be requested by the probationary employee and approved by the head of such employee's department in which he held his classified position. Such noncivil service employment shall not bar employees, holding permanent civil service status, from qualifying for promotional examination to the classification next higher to their permanent civil service classification. 
(b)  Any employee of the city who holds permanent civil service status and is appointed or assigned to any other position not under civil service may be removed from such position by the city manager and may be terminated for sufficient cause, pursuant to the procedures under this article.

(a)  The director of a department, with the approval of the city manager, may grant leaves of absence without pay for the following causes and not otherwise: 
(1)  If the employee has a temporary physical disability; however, no such leave shall be given for a period to exceed 90 days unless the disability was caused by an injury without negligence on the part of the employee, received in the performance of duty, in which latter case the period of leave may be extended with the approval of the city manager. 
(2)  If the employee requests the leave for the purpose of entering a course of training or study or to engage in an investigation calculated to improve the quality of the employee's service; but no leave shall be granted for a period to exceed six months, with the right to extend for another six months if approved by the city manager and the department head. Where a leave of absence is given for more than 90 days, the position shall be filled, if necessary, by a temporary appointment from the eligible register. 
(3)  If the employee requests the leave for an injury on the job or military service. In the case of an employee recovering from an injury, a longer leave of absence than six months may be granted, provided the physician designated by the city manager shall examine and certify that the employee's leave should be extended for a longer period, and provided further that a similar certificate of necessity shall be filed every three months thereafter as long as the employee continues to be absent. 
(4)  If the employee has a good reason other than mentioned in this section which shall be sufficient to warrant granting the leave; however, the leave shall not exceed 90 days, and the employee shall understand that the acceptance of another position or engaging in other employment while on leave of absence shall be deemed a resignation from the service of the city. Any vacancy for such cause shall be filled by a temporary employee for a duration of not more than 90 days. Leave of absence during the required probationary period of service of an employee shall extend the probationary period the length of time used during the leave of absence. 
(b)  In no case shall a leave of absence be given within 90 days of the employee's appointment, neither shall a leave of absence be granted within six months after the return of the employee from a leave of 15 days or more, except in the case of a physical disability. At the expiration of a leave of absence, the employee shall be returned to the position vacated when the leave of absence was granted. 
(c)  Whenever a leave of absence without pay is granted, it shall be promptly reported in writing to the human resources department.

Sec. 21-222. - Abolishment of positions. 
(a)  When a position is abolished, or if necessary is merged with another position of a different classification, the person who held the position shall replace that employee whose position on the layoff register is lowest in an identical classification. Should the person elect to waive this privilege, he shall be transferred by the human resources department to the head of the eligible register of the classification held prior to his removal for a period not to exceed one year, within which time the person may be certified for employment. 
(b)  Should it be found advisable to revive or recreate a formerly abolished position within one year from the date of the abolishment, the last incumbent of the original position shall be entitled to the new position provided he was a permanent employee at the date of his separation and provided he is otherwise eligible. 
(c)  The names of persons who held permanent positions in the classified service which have been abolished or have become unnecessary shall be placed on an appropriate layoff register in the order of their seniority, the most senior being first, if otherwise qualified. Such employee shall be reemployed with the seniority as of the date of his involuntary separation. 
(d)  If a reduction in force or any grade causes a member of the lowest grade of the force to go into inactive duty, the member on inactive duty shall not receive any pay; but the inactive member shall not lose his seniority, provided he remains inactive for a period not exceeding one year, and reenters on active duty within ten days after notice has been given him by the human resources department that a position is open.

When a responsive, responsible nonlocal business submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by the tier 2 local vendor is within five percent of the lowest price submitted by any vendor, the tier 2 local vendor shall have an option to submit another bid to match the lowest responsive bid. If the tier 2 local vendor submits a bid which matches that lowest responsive bid, then the award will go to the tier 2 local vendor. If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest responsive bid. 
(3)  Competitive bid tier 3 local vendor preference. When a responsive, responsible nonlocal business submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by the tier 3 local vendor is within two and one-half percent of the lowest price submitted by any vendor, the tier 3 local vendor shall have an option to submit another bid to match the lowest responsive bid. If the tier 3 local vendor submits a bid which matches that lowest responsive bid, then the award will go to the tier 3 local vendor. If not, the award will be made to the vendor that submits the lowest responsive bid. 
If there is a tier 1 local vendor and a tier 2 local vendor and a tier 3 local vendor participating in the same bid solicitation and the three vendors qualify to submit a second bid as detailed above, the tier 1 local vendor will be given first option. 
If the tier 1 local vendor cannot match the lowest bid received, an opportunity will be given to the tier 2 local vendor. If the tier 2 local vendor cannot match the lowest bid received, then an opportunity will be given to the tier 3 local vendor. If the tier 3 local vendor cannot match the lowest bid received, then the bid will be awarded to the lowest bidder regardless of tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor preference. 
If multiple local vendors submit bids which are within ten percent of the lowest bid, then all vendors will be asked to submit a "best and final offer (BAFO)." The award will be made to the tier 1 local vendor submitting the lowest BAFO providing that the BAFO at least matches the lowest bid received in the original solicitation. If no tier 1 local vendor can beat the lowest bid by matching it, then the process will be repeated with tier 2 and tier 3 local vendors who have submitted a bid which is within two and one-half percent of the lowest bid. If no tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor can submit a BAFO that matches the lowest bid submitted in the original solicitation, the award will be made to the lowest responsive bidder regardless of the tiers. 
(g)  Application of local vendor preference for requests for proposals: When evaluation points are used to evaluate through a solicitation, and when a non-local business is the highest ranked proposer, and the ranking of a local firm is within ten percent of the total 100 ranking points, then the city may elect to negotiate with the local firm first. 
(h)  Process to apply the local vendor preference to competitive proposal: For contract awards based upon evaluation criteria pursuant to a point system, there shall be a local participation criterion to be included in the total 100 points to be awarded. The points shall be awarded as follows: 
(1)  Tier 1 local vendor preference: If 100 percent through 50 percent of the project work submitted as a response to a solicitation, which equals to 100 percent through 50 percent of the project cost, will be provided and performed by a tier 1 local vendor then the firm will receive, through the evaluation process, a total of ten points. 
(2)  Tier 2 local vendor preference: If 49 percent through 20 percent of the project work submitted as a response to a solicitation, which equals to 49 percent to 20 percent of the project cost, will be provided and performed by a tier 2 local vendor then the firm will receive, through the evaluation process, a total of five points. 
(3)  Tier 3 local vendor preference: If 19 percent through less than five percent of the project work submitted as a response to a solicitation, which equals to 19 percent to less than five percent of the project cost, will be provided and performed by a tier 3 local vendor then the firm will receive, through the evaluation process, a total of two and one-half points. 
Total Project Dollar Cost ($) Performed Total Points Awarded Tier 1 Local Vendor 100% to 50% 10 Tier 2 Local Vendor 49% to 20% 5 Tier 3 Local Vendor 19% to less than 5% 2.5  
    The percentage of tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor participation will be calculated by the proposer's cost and/or expenditure's provided and performed by a local tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor subcontractor for providing direct labor or a bona fide service, the total cost of the project dollar submitted and identified in the proposal. 
    A proposer may count towards its local vendor preference for tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3, the fee or commissions charged for providing direct labor or a bona fide service, such as professional, technical consultant or managerial services. 
(i)  Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act (CCNA): For contracts awarded pursuant to the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act (CCNA) and through request for qualifications the applicability of the local vendor preference is as follows: 
    The percentages reflect the amount of total project work, which shall be equated to the project dollars, assigned to the tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor. The location of qualified entities shall be considered in determining the qualification for professional service governed by the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act and through an RFQ process. 
(j)  Exemptions to tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3: The city will not count toward a proposer tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor participation any portion or portions of the local vendor subcontractor's work that is subcontracted back to as follows: 
(1)  The proposer either directly, or through any other company or firm owned or controlled by the proposer. 
(2)  Any nonlocal business. 
(3)  A tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor shall not be permitted to subcontract all or a majority of the sub contractual portion of the work to another nonlocal business. A tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor subcontractor shall be prohibited from engaging in a sub contractual agreement with the intent of collecting a broker's fee or commission. A tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor subcontractor shall also be prohibited from entering into a sub contractual agreement with a firm whose employees perform none of the direct labor or service activities specified in the contract. 
(4)  Participation by a tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local business shall not be considered and the tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor shall be disqualified if the owner of the tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 enters into an agreement with a nonlocal business with the intent of securing employment with that nonlocal business during the course of performing a city contract. 
(k)  Exceptions to applicability of local vendor preference: 
(1)  No tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor preference will be included in any competitive solicitation where the city is the lead agency for the southeast Florida cooperative purchasing group. 
(2)  Utilization of a state or other agency contract. 
(3)  State or federal law prohibits the use of local preference. 
(4)  The work is funded in whole or in part by a governmental entity where the laws, rules, regulations or policies prohibit the use of local preferences. 
(5)  Sole source or single source purchases. 
(6)  The tier 1, tier 2 or tier 3 local vendor is either non-responsive or non-responsible. 
(7)  All bids submitted exceed the budget amount for the project. 
(8)  Emergency purchases. 
(9)  The city manager and/or the commission may exempt any competitive solicitation from the local vendor preference.

Authority to complete such purchase and expenditure is granted; and if the expenditure is not completed after a reasonable time, the city manager is authorized and directed to cancel and close out the unexpended balance of the appropriation. 
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 3, 5-5-2013) 
Sec. 23-12. - Procedures for purchases in excess of $50,000.00. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this division, the purchase of commodities or services of an estimated value in excess of $50,000.00 shall be approved by the city commission and may be by purchase order and/or other written contract with the vendor submitting the lowest responsible bid whose bid has been solicited, received and approved, pursuant to the following procedures: 
(1)  Advertisements. Notice inviting solicitations. Except of those solicitations that are required by statute to be advertised in a newspaper, notices inviting solicitations shall be published electronically. A general description of the commodities or services to be purchased, a statement of where the solicitation documents may be obtained, and the date, time and place of receipt is to be provided. 
(2)  Security (bid bonds). When the estimated cost of a contract is $150,000.00 or higher, or when otherwise deemed necessary by the city manager, security in the form of a bid bond issued by a surety company licensed to do business in the state or a cash bond in an amount equal to ten percent of the bid shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. When the city manager deems it necessary to require a bid bond for bids less than $150,000.00, the bond shall be in an amount equal to five percent of the bid. A vendor shall forfeit a bid security upon a refusal or failure to execute the contract within 15 calendar days of the notice of award of contract, unless the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the contract. The city commission may, upon the refusal or failure of the successful vendor to execute the contract, award the contract to the next lowest vendor. 
(3)  Bid opening procedures. Sealed written bids shall be returned to the city and identified as bids on the envelope, together with other information as may be specified in the invitation to bid. Bids shall be opened in public on the date and at the time and place stated in the public notices as specified by Florida Statute.

A performance bond and a payment bond, or a "contract bond" combining the elements of a performance and a payment bond, issued by a surety company licensed to do business in the state, may be required before entering into a contract, in an amount at least equal to the contract price or such higher amount as may be found reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city except, in limited circumstances, such as incremental services contracts or blanket purchase orders, where it has been determined by the department director that the potential liability resulting from the performance or payment under the contract is an amount less than the full contract price. If such bond is required, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. Bonds required hereunder shall be subject to all other provisions of this section and this Code. 
(6)  Security in lieu of performance and payment bonds. In lieu of the bond required by this section, a contractor may file with the city an alternative form of security in the form of cash, money order, certified check, cashier's check, an irrevocable letter of credit, or security of a type listed in F.S. § 625.301 et seq. Any such alternative form of security shall be for the same purpose and be subject to the same conditions as those applicable to the bond required hereunder. The appropriate representative of the city as described in subsection (5) of this section shall make the determination of the value of the alternative form of security. 
(7)  Change orders. Any change in the contract price, scope of work or time for completion of any project following the award of a contract shall be by a written change order, approved by the city manager and executed with the same formalities as the contract. However, the city manager may approve and execute change orders without city commission approval subject to the following limitations: 
a.  The city manager may approve any change orders so long as the total sum of all change orders does not exceed the total amount awarded by the city commission by more than either ten percent of the contract cost or $50,000.00, whichever is less. The scope of any project may not be changed without prior approval of the city commission. No increase in contract price shall be approved unless there are sufficient funds available for such purpose. 
b.  Contract price decreases may be approved without limitation. 
c.  No change order shall materially change the scope of the work unless approved by the city commission. 
d.  In the event the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid for a project exceeds available funds, and the city commission does not make available additional funds, the city manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of bids, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price as long as the scope of work is not materially changed with the lowest, most responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Final negotiations shall be in written form as approved by the city manager. 
(8)  Demonstration of products. All departments that engage firms in the demonstration, inspection and/or testing of supplies or services for which no formal solicitation has been advertised, must involve the procurement department in the demonstrations and/or testing. Where there would be an eventual solicitation for the products and/or services which have previously gone through a demonstration and/or inspection, it must be made known at the pre-bid meeting for the particular solicitation released.

Sec. 23-13. - Protests procedures. 
    Any party may present a written protest about the award of a contract as a result of an RFP, RFQ or bid to the director of procurement. Emergency procurements, purchases for goods, supplies, equipment, and services, the estimated cost of which does not exceed $50,000.00, are not subject to protests.

The filling fee shall guarantee the payment of all costs which may be adjudged against the protestor in any administrative or court proceeding. If a protest is upheld by the director of procurement, the filing fee shall be refunded to the protestor less any costs assessed under subsection (4), costs, below. 
(4)  Costs. All costs accrued from a protest shall be assumed by the protestor. 
(5)  Authority to resolve protests. The procurement director shall have the authority, subject to the approval of the city manager and the city attorney, to settle and resolve any written protest within 30 days after receipt of the written protest. 
(6)  Special magistrate. In the event the protest is not resolved by the procurement director, a hearing shall be scheduled by the city before a special magistrate selected by the city, who shall only determine whether procedural due process has been afforded, whether the essential requirements of law have been observed, and whether the procurement director's finding are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Any hearing shall be limited to two hours per side, unless the special magistrate rules otherwise. This requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the institution of any civil action regarding the same subject matter.

(Ord. No. 2014-16, § 3, 5-21-2014) 
Sec. 25-118. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this section. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this section, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city as of the effective date of this article shall comply with this article within 60 days from the effective date of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation hereof. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this section governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this chapter. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under section 25-126 of this chapter and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article; 
(4)  A copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization or local business tax receipt to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any; 
(5)  For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, including the number of the certificate of incorporation; and 
(6)  A security fund in accordance with section 25-129 of this chapter. 
(d)  The city manager, or his or her designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant. If the applicant submits information in accordance with division (c) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with division (c) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this chapter and further subject to any additional city's ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this chapter, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to division (c), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this section. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations and this chapter, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(i)  A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be required to pay compensation to the city as required by applicable law and ordinances of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2014-16, § 3, 5-21-2014) 
Sec. 25-119. - Transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 24 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 25-118 of this chapter within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the engineering division that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(b)  Any encumbrance on the communications facilities of the registrant in the public rights-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under this article and applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2014-16, § 3, 5-21-2014) 
Sec. 25-120. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility or personal wireless service facility in public rights-of-way.

(1)  Required approvals. No application for placement of personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be permitted without approval of the building division, the public works department, and the planning and zoning division. 
(2)  a.  Because an antenna must be placed above-ground in order to transmit and receive signals, an applicant proposing placement of an antenna in the public rights-of-way, except in the case of a co-location, shall submit an application for approval through the planning and zoning division as a non-quasi-judicial action before the planning and zoning board. The application shall consist of the following: 
1.  Application form provided by the city accompanied by the required application fee; 
2.  Copy of current business tax receipt; 
3.  A scaled site plan depicting an area within a 600-foot radius from the center of the proposed personal wireless service facility, and showing the proposed antennas, equipment, related infrastructure, sidewalks, all existing utilities, antennas, towers, stealth facilities, the right-of-way boundaries, wireless communications facility boundary, road improvements, all ingress and egress to nearby streets, major vegetation, required grading, existing and proposed elevations, easements, and other significant features of the site. 
4.  Certification signed by applicant confirming the distance separation from other personal wireless service facilities.

(3)  Completeness review; time limitation. The city shall grant or deny a properly completed application for personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way within 90 days or, as required by federal and state law, after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the planning and zoning division. The planning and zoning division shall notify the applicant within 20 days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, whether the application is properly completed in compliance with the city's requirements. If the application is not completed in compliance with the city's requirements, the planning and zoning division shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the planning and zoning division shall notify the applicant, in writing, no later than 20 days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. If a specified deficiency is not properly cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of deficiencies, the planning and zoning division may continue to request the information until such time as the specified deficiency is cured, or may establish a reasonable time frame within which the required information to cure the application deficiency is to be provided. If the curative information is not provided within such time frame, the application will be considered withdrawn or closed. 
(4)  Co-location or use of stealth facilities. An antenna in the public right-of-way, shall to the extent possible, be co-located on an existing power, light or other utility pole. When co-location of an antenna is not possible, a free standing stealth facility is preferred. For co-locations, the applicant shall submit an application to the city's building division for approval. 
(5)  Statement. A statement or statements shall be submitted certifying that the construction of personal wireless service facilities proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way will comply with applicable standards as set forth in the Florida Building Code, Broward County latest edition, the State of Florida Department of Transportation, Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, and applicable electrical codes; and describing the proposed personal wireless service facilities' capacity to permit multiple users, including an example of the number and type of antennas or other attachments that can be accommodated on support structures.

4.  A box or cabinet housing the equipment connected to an antenna attached to a free-standing pole in the public rights-of-way shall be placed on the ground instead of attached to the pole supporting the antenna, and shall be screened from view. 
b.  Antennas. 
1.  Each application for a personal wireless service facility, other than for co-location, shall contain a rendering or photograph of the proposed antenna which depicts its aesthetic features including, but not limited to, the use of colors and screening devices. The application shall be subject to administrative review regarding consistency with the requirements of this section. The city manager, or his/her designee, may require, to the extent possible, that aesthetic features including but not limited to, the use of colors and screening devices, be used so that antennas blend into the surrounding environment. 
2.  No signals, lights, or illumination shall be permitted on an antenna or, except in the case of a light pole or a stealth facility designed to emulate a light pole, on a pole to which such antenna is attached, unless required by applicable state or federal laws or rules. 
3.  Antennas shall be mounted at a height and location that will not interfere with use of the public rights-of-way. 
4.  No exterior antenna in the public rights-of-way shall exceed the height of the pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-location to an existing power, light or other utility pole or on a pole designed to emulate a light pole. 
5.  No antenna shall be mounted more than four inches from the pole to which it is attached unless it is attached as a co-location to an existing power, light or other utility pole. 
6.  Exterior looping of excess cable length installed on any personal wireless service facility located in the public right-of-way is prohibited. 
7.  Distance between antenna locations/number of antenna locations within a specified area. To minimize the adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of antennas and associated above-ground personal wireless service facilities, no antenna site in the public rights-of-way shall be located within 600 feet of any other such antenna site or telecommunications tower. Further, no more than 13 antenna sites may be located within an area of one square mile (one mi 2 ). This division (d)(6)(b)(7) shall not apply to any antenna co-located on an existing power, light or other utility pole within the public rights-of-way. 
c.  Co-locations. For the purposes of this section, "co-location" means the mounting or installation of an antenna on an existing power, light or other utility pole for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. In any co-location, the existing power, light or other utility pole may be modified or replaced to accommodate the new attachment, provided however that the modified or replacement pole complies with the height, setback and related location requirements, unless such requirements are waived. For the purposes of this section, an existing power, light or other utility pole modified or replaced to accommodate a new attachment shall continue to be considered an existing pole after replacement or modification. 
d.  Approval required from other governmental agencies and owners. Each application for the location of a personal wireless service facility in the public rights-of-way may be required to include written approval, or a statement of no objection, from state agencies that regulate siting, design, and construction of such facilities, or have jurisdiction over the public rights-of-way, if any such agencies require the applicant to seek their review or approval. An existing facility in the public rights-of-way shall only be utilized in a manner consistent with the City Code and with the written permission of the facility owner. 
e.  FCC emissions standards. All personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall comply with current radio frequency emissions standards of the Federal Communications Commission. 
f.  Buffering. 
1.  Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a condition of approval the city manager, or his/her designee may require the use of a fence as a buffer that is consistent in design and function with existing fencing used in the public rights-of-way. 
2.  Except in the case of an application for a co-location, as a condition of approval the city manager, or his/her designee, may require the use of landscaping as a buffer, which landscaping is consistent with the landscaping otherwise located in the public rights-of-way. Additional landscaping may be required if deemed necessary to buffer adjacent properties. The city manager, or his/her designee, may require landscaping in excess of the requirements of the City Code to enhance compatibility with adjacent residential and nonresidential land uses. 
3.  All buffering required in connection with the use of personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be maintained by the owner of such facilities at its own cost. 
g.  Equipment. The location in the public rights-of-way of any equipment or equipment cabinets associated with personal wireless service facilities shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer. Any such cabinets or equipment must be approved by the city engineer as to safety, and shall not interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way. The city engineer may require a statement certifying the need for the proposed equipment and location. No generators utilized in connection with personal wireless services facilities may be placed in the public rights-of-way, except temporarily in the case of emergency and if approved in advance by the city engineer. 
h.  Signs and advertising.

2.  The owner or operator of a personal wireless service facility in the public rights-of-way shall submit a report to the city's public works department, certifying the integrity of the personal wireless service facility and the safety of electrical components at least once every three years. 
j.  Cooperative determination. In the event an applicant demonstrates, in writing, to the satisfaction of the city manager, or his/her designee that the operation of this section produces a result which is either (i) a burdensome hardship on the applicant, and is inconsistent with the general public welfare; or, (ii) inconsistent with the intent of the particular provisions of this section, and inconsistent with the general public welfare, the applicant and the city manager, or his/her designee, shall cooperate to determine an appropriate location and aesthetic design for the proposed facility. In any such cooperative determination there shall be a preference for co-location with existing personal wireless service facilities or other utility facilities, or for use of unused capacity on existing personal wireless service facilities. Where facilities cannot be co-located and no such unused capacity exists, there shall be a preference for the use of free standing stealth-type structures which are consistent, to the extent possible, with this section. The city manager, or his/her designee may require a written statement certifying that the proposed location is needed by a personal wireless services provider to close a significant gap in its service to the affected area. 
k.  Modifications or replacements. Modification or replacement of any personal wireless service facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to approval of the city's building division. If such modification or replacement of personal wireless service facilities or equipment would, as reasonably determined by the city, result in the facility or equipment being readily discernibly different in size, type, and appearance when viewed from ground level from surrounding properties, such modification shall require approval as a non-quasi-judicial item before the planning and zoning board. Any co-location of personal wireless service facilities, removal of personal wireless service facilities or replacement of personal wireless service facilities that substantially changes the physical dimensions of an antenna node site shall be subject to approval of the city's building division.

l.  Statements and certifications. Any statement or certification submitted by or on behalf of an applicant pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be prepared applying rational analysis by one or more engineers registered and licensed in the state, or by such other person or persons designated by the applicant who are qualified to perform the required analysis. Any person or persons providing such a statement or statements shall also certify as to his or her competence in the discipline or disciplines necessary to perform the analysis and to provide the statement.

If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city will provide the registrant a seven-day notice to cure any failure to restore. In the event the registrant fails to restore the public rights-of-way upon the expiration of the seven-day notice, the city may perform such restoration as it deems necessary and charge all costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended.

The city may require a registrant to alter its placement or maintenance schedule as the city determines to be reasonably necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. The city may provide a more definite time frame based on individual city construction or maintenance schedules. 
(j)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities or personal wireless service facilities and any performance of work or costs incurred by registrant or provision of services shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this chapter shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way and city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities or personal wireless service facilities. 
(k)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities and personal wireless service facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(m)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities or personal wireless service facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. If the city requests a temporary raising or lowering of a facility for a public purpose, the city shall not be charged for the temporary raising or lowering of the facility.

In no event shall an applicant be given final approval if the applicant does not meet all the requirements for towing services as set forth in this article. 
(b)  Demonstrated unwillingness or inability to meet with or comply with any of the requirements, specifications, rules, regulations or policies pertaining to the application and service to be rendered will prohibit approval of an initial application submitted by a towing service and may result in the cancellation of the privilege of performing towing services by any towing agency subsequent to its original approval. 
(c)  If conditions arise or circumstances occur which render the continued approval and assignment of a towing agency to be not in the best interest of the city as determined by the chief of police, the right to withdraw approval and to cancel the towing agency license is reserved; and the exercise of this right will be in the discretion of the chief of police. 
(d)  A towing agency operating in the city shall meet the following conditions: 
(1)  The towing agency shall pay a fee and obtain a license as required under section 18-37.

(d)  Removal permit issuance. No permit shall be issued for tree removal unless one of the following conditions exists: 
(1)  The tree is located in the buildable area, yard area or street right-of-way where a structure or improvement is to be placed and for which a permit application has been filed, and it unreasonably restricts the permitted use of the property, and the applicant has made every reasonable effort to incorporate existing trees and to minimize the number of trees removed. 
(2)  The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling, too close to existing or proposed structures so as to endanger such structures, interferes with utility services, creates unsafe vision clearance, is growing in too close proximity to other trees to permit normal growth and development of affected trees consistent with good forestry practices or where a tree is causing damage to the public right-of-way. 
(3)  The tree unreasonably restricts bona fide agricultural use of the property and is located in a zoning district which permits agricultural use. 
(4)  The trees proposed to be removed are the minimum number necessary for use of the property. 
(e)  Relocation or replacement permit issuance. As a condition of the granting of a permit, the applicant must either relocate the trees being removed or replace the trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. If it is determined that an applicant cannot relocate or replace removed trees, the applicant shall pay the appropriate fee into the city's tree preservation trust fund. 
(f)  Tree relocation bond requirement. 
(1)  Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter, any person conducting tree relocation activities involving specimen trees must post a bond to insure the survival of the trees.

This bond shall be in addition to any other bond required by any other government entity. 
(2)  The amount of the required bond shall be computed based upon the most current version of the "Guide for Plant Appraisal," published by the International Society of Arboriculture. 
(3)  Government entities are exempt from bond requirements. 
(g)  Release and drawing on bonds. Tree relocation bonds will be released upon successful tree relocation as set forth in subsection (i) of this section. Bonds involving specimen trees shall be released upon completion of construction activities if it is determined by the city that the trees are not effectively destroyed. 
(1)  Bonds may be released by the city when a tree removal permit is transferred. The city may require the subsequent permittee to replace the bond prior to agreeing to release the original bond. 
(2)  If a tree is determined by the city to be effectively destroyed within one year from the date of relocation, the bond shall be drawn upon and funds will be deposited into the city tree preservation trust fund. 
(h)  Methodology for payment into tree preservation trust fund. If it is determined that an applicant cannot relocate or replace removed trees, the applicant shall pay a fee into the city's tree preservation trust fund. The applicant will submit three cost estimates which reflect the dollar value of the trees being removed. Cost estimates must be based upon the species, height, diameter and maturity of the trees; and estimates must be prepared by a licensed nursery. The city will determine the accuracy of the submitted estimates. The applicant is required to make payment for the accepted cost estimate plus the cost for installation. Installation costs are equal to twice the cost of the trees. 
(i)  Relocation plan. If any tree is to be relocated on or off the site, a relocation plan must be submitted and approved by the city prior to granting a tree removal permit. In determining the required relocation or replacement of trees, the designated public agency shall consider the needs of the intended use of the property, together with a realistic evaluation of the following: 
(1)  Tree canopy coverage shall be determined so there is no loss of coverage upon maturity of the replacement trees. 
(2)  Number of trees to be removed on the entire property. The replacement canopy coverage shall at least equal the area of canopy coverage which was removed. Relocation of trees on the site will be counted towards equivalent replacement canopy. Relocation of trees off the site shall be counted as half credit towards equivalent replacement. 
(3)  Area to be covered with structures, parking, and driveways. 
(4)  Topography and drainage. 
(5)  Character of the site and its environs. 
(6)  Ecology of the site.

For 21 to 50 replacement trees required, a minimum of four species shall be utilized. For 51 of more replacement trees required, a minimum of five species shall be utilized. 
(10)  For trees removed pursuant to section 29-4(d)(1), an additional 50 percent tree replacement shall be required. 
(11)  Replacement trees shall be Florida No. 1 quality or better. The diameter of the replacement tree shall be equal to or greater than the diameter of the trees being removed. More than one tree may be utilized for replacement if the aggregate sum of the diameters of the replacement trees is equal to or greater than the diameter of the trees being removed. Each replacement tree shall have the largest diameter commercially available in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties for the tree species selected, provided that no replacement tree shall have a diameter of less than three inches. Diameter measurements shall be made at four and one-half feet above the ground. 
(12)  The method to be followed in relocating trees shall be in compliance with the guidelines for tree relocation available in the growth management department. 
(13)  For tree protection from construction work during any construction, land development or lot clearing, the contractor and the owner of the property subject to this section shall adhere to the requirements as follows: 
a.  Place and maintain protective barriers around the dripline of all trees to be retained on the site to prevent their destruction or damage. The protective barriers shall be conspicuous enough and high enough to be seen easily by operators of trucks and other equipment. Protective barriers shall be constructed of sturdy material (not flagging or ribbons). 
b.  Not store or use materials or equipment within the dripline of any tree to be retained on the site unless the activity is being done to protect trees. 
c.  Not discharge or contaminate the soil within the dripline of any tree to be retained on the site with any construction materials such as paint, oil, solvents, petroleum products, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or other materials that may cause adverse impacts. 
d.  Clearing of vegetation within the dripline of trees designated for preservation shall only be by hand or light rubber-wheeled equipment that will not damage tree roots. 
e.  Utilize retaining walls and drywells where needed to protect trees to be preserved from severe grade changes. 
f.  Pruning of trees to be preserved shall be in accordance with the standards for pruning established by the National Arborist Association or standards for palm pruning as listed in "Arboriculture Second Edition" by Richard W. Harris, as amended. 
g.  Make no attachments, other than those of a protective and nondamaging nature, to any tree to be retained on the site. 
h.  Not change the natural grade above the root system within the dripline of any tree to be retained on the site unless it can be demonstrated to the city that it will not damage any tree. 
i.  Avoid any encroachments, excavations or severe grade changes within the dripline of preserved trees unless it can be demonstrated to the city that it will not impact any tree. 
j.  Any trees designated to be preserved which are damaged during construction shall promptly be repaired. 
(14)  Any person who abuses a tree in violation of this article shall: 
a.  Undertake pruning and other remedial action as determined by the city, not limited to the removal of severely abused trees to protect public safety and property, and corrective pruning to improve the health and form of affected trees. No tree removal permit is required for the removal of severely abused trees that are removed pursuant to city direction. 
b.  Plant replacement trees pursuant to the provisions of section 32-385 if the natural habit of growth of the abused tree is destroyed. 
(j)  Tree replacement for specimen trees. A tree appraisal will be performed by the city to determine the dollar value of any specimen tree approved by the city for removal pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. This appraisal shall be pursuant to the "Guide for Plant Appraisal, Eighth Edition," as amended by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. 
(k)  Tree replacement requirements for nonspecimen trees. 
(1)  If the city determines that a removed tree cannot be successfully relocated, the tree shall be replaced to compensate for lost canopy coverage. 
(2)  The following criteria shall be used by the city to determine the tree replacement requirements: 
a.  The tree canopy coverage of a site shall be determined using any combination of the following methods: 
1.  Review of aerial photography. 
2.  On-site inspection. 
3.  Review of tree survey. 
b.  A tree that is successfully relocated pursuant to subsection (i) of this section need not be replaced. 
c.  Native trees must be planted to replace native tree canopy coverage removed. 
d.  The number required of replacement trees shall be based upon the size of area of impact and the species of replacement trees selected by the applicant. The canopy of the replacement trees at maturity shall at least equal the canopy removed. 
(l)  Tree replacement requirements for abused trees.

Such notification shall provide a reasonable time for repair of the pipes, plumbing system, fixtures or fittings not in excess of 30 days and shall further advise the respondent that failure to timely repair the leaking pipes, plumbing system, fittings or fixtures shall result in discontinuance of the respondent's water supply. Plumbing permit shall be obtained by a licensed contractor for all repairs. 
(3)  Persons so desiring may appeal the proposed action of the director of development services or his/her designee by filing a written request for a hearing with the city manager's office within five days of the receipt of the letter described in subsection (b) of this section. If such a request is timely filed, the appeal shall be promptly heard by the city Manager or his/her designee, who shall at such hearing consider and hear the statements and submitted documents of both the respondent and the director of development services. The city manager may thereafter affirm, deny or modify the proposed action of the director of development services or his/her designee; however, if the city manager or his/her designee shall affirm the director's or his/her designee's action, the water service shall not be disconnected before the expiration of the time given to make repairs provided in subsection (b) of this section; and further, the city manager or his/her designee may modify the action of the director of development services or his/her designee by extending or shortening the time given to make repairs or by modifying the scope of repairs found necessary or the type of repairs previously found to be necessary. 
(4)  If the condition is not remedied and following the time period specified in subsection (b) of this section if no appeal is filed, or following the hearing provided under subsection (c) of this section if an appeal is filed and violation is upheld, the city shall discontinue water service to the affected premises and the meter to the premises shall be disconnected. A disconnect charge, in accordance with the current fee booklet, shall be debited against the deposit the customer maintains with the city.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 

Sec. 30-241. - Stormwater management utility fee. 
(a)  A stormwater utility fee is imposed upon each lot and parcel within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater management utility. For purposes of imposing the stormwater utility fee, each residential dwelling unit shall be billed a flat fee established for residential units as the rate established for one equivalent residential unit (ERU). 
(b)  All nonresidential properties shall be billed based on their estimated impervious area divided by the ERU impervious area and then multiplied by the rate established for one ERU. The estimated impervious area of a nonresidential property shall be determined by multiplying the property area by the appropriate impervious factor as follows: 
Use Designation Impervious Factor Commercial (B-O) 0.80 Commercial 0.85 Industrial 0.85 Commercial Recreational 0.25 Public and Institutional 0.75  
Formula: stormwater utility fee for nonresidential property = 
ERU rate × total area of property (in acres) × impervious factor ERU (in acres) 
    The minimum fee for any nonresidential parcel shall be equal to the rate for one ERU. 
(c)  Undeveloped property and city-owned property shall be exempt from the stormwater utility fee. 
(d)  The city commission may, by resolution, change the average impervious area of one ERU. 
(e)  The rate for one ERU shall be established in the schedule of fees and charges ("fee book"). This rate may be amended by resolution of the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-242. - Adjustment of fees. 
    Requests for adjustment of the stormwater utility fee shall be submitted through the public works engineer or his/her designee, who shall be given authority to administer the procedures and standards, and review criteria for the adjustment of fees as established in this section. All requests shall be judged on the basis of the amount of impervious area on the site, or the need for additional/enhanced stormwater facilities. No credit shall be given for the installation of facilities required by any agencies having jurisdiction for stormwater management. The following procedures shall apply to all adjustment requests of the stormwater utility fee: 
(1)  Any owner who has paid his/her stormwater utility fees and who believes the impervious area determination to be incorrect may, subject to the limitations set forth in this article, submit an adjustment request to the public works engineer. 
(2)  Requests for adjustment of stormwater utility fees shall be in writing on forms provided by the city, shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought, and shall be filed along with a processing fee as set by resolution. 
(3)  Adjustment requests made during the first calendar year that the stormwater utility fee is imposed will be reviewed by the public works engineer or his/her designee within a four-month period from the date of filing of the adjustment request. Adjustments resulting from such request shall be retroactive to the beginning of billings but shall not exceed one year. 
(4)  The owner requesting the adjustment may be required, at his/her own cost, to provide supplemental information to the public works engineer or his/her designee, including but not limited to survey data and engineering reports, performed by either a registered professional land surveyor (R.P.L.S.) or a professional engineer (P.E.) currently registered in the state. Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the adjustment request. 
(5)  Adjustments to the stormwater utility fee will be made upon the granting of the adjustment request, in writing, by the public works engineer or his/her designee. Denials of adjustment requests shall be made in writing by the public works engineer or his/her designee. 
(6)  Any property owner who disputes the results of a request made to the public works engineer for adjustment may petition in writing to the city manager or his/her designee for a review of said charges. The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014)

ARTICLE VI. - WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 30-245. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Hallandale Beach Water and Wastewater Impact Fee Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-246. - Authorization. 
    This article is enacted pursuant to law, and F.S. ch. 180 which provides local municipalities with the authority to establish and operate water and wastewater utility systems. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-247. - Commission findings. 
    The Hallandale Beach City Commission hereby makes and expresses the following findings, purposes, and intent: 
(1)  Significant growth is expected to occur in the areas that are provided water and wastewater utility services by the city. 
(2)  Growth within the service area has resulted in the need to expand the water production and distribution system, to expand the wastewater transmission system, and to negotiate available, treatment (purchased) capacity with the City of Hollywood to accommodate the demands imposed by such growth without decreasing the current level of utility services at the cost of existing users. 
(3)  Expansion of water and wastewater utility services to accommodate new growth shall promote and protect the interests and general welfare of the residents of Hallandale Beach. 
(4)  In order for future growth to pay more equitably the cost of expanding the water production and distribution system and the wastewater system to meet the demands imposed by such growth, the city commission finds that the adoption of water and wastewater impact fees, to be levied as one-time charges upon new users (connections) or new demand on the system created through expansions or renovations, is an appropriate and equitable method of capital cost recovery. 
(5)  The intent of the water and wastewater impact fees is to recover only the pro rata share of the costs incurred to meet the demands of growth. 
(6)  In order for the city to recover the carrying costs associated with providing new capacity today to meet the needs of future growth, the city commission recognizes that the adoption of accrued guaranteed revenue charges (AGRCs) would reimburse the city for the costs of constructing and maintaining water and wastewater capacity in advance of new growth, and that such charges provide equity between existing and future customers of the water and wastewater system (the "system"). 
(7)  The report entitled "City of Hallandale Beach, Florida Water and Wastewater Impact Fee Study," dated July 2008, and the report entitled "Wastewater Treatment Impact Fee Study," dated 2009, set forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development on the need for and costs of additional water and wastewater transmission capital facilities in the City of Hallandale Beach and the estimation of accrued guaranteed revenue charges. 
(8)  The commission's intent is to expend the water and wastewater impact fees collected pursuant to this article only for the purposes for which they were collected, specifically, to defray the capital cost incurred to meet the demands imposed by growth. 
(9)  The commission's intent is to recognize the revenues received from the accrued guaranteed revenue charges as unrestricted and available for any lawful purpose of the system since such revenues are collected to reimburse the city for operating carrying costs. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-248. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply within the water and wastewater service territory of the City of Hallandale Beach, including those areas that are annexed into the city after the effective date of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-249. - Payment of water and wastewater impact fees and AGRC. 
(a)  Imposed. Any person who seeks to connect to the City of Hallandale Beach's water and/or wastewater system, or whom expands and/or changes the use of an existing facility beyond the current reserved capacity for such facility is hereby required to pay a water and/or wastewater impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in the schedule of impact fees, and is required to pay a water and/or wastewater accrued guaranteed revenue charge in the manner and amount set forth in the schedule of accrued guaranteed revenue charges. 
(b)  Residential basis. The residential water and wastewater impact fees and accrued guaranteed revenue charges are based on equivalent residential units (ERUs). An ERU shall mean any structure which provides living accommodations for a single family (single-family residence). A residential structure shall be charged according to the number of ERUs located in each structure. The City of Hallandale Beach defines an ERU as 350 and 315 gallons per day for the water and wastewater systems, respectively. 
(c)  Non-residential basis. The non-residential water and wastewater impact fees and accrued guaranteed revenue charges are based on a charge per gallon of capacity reservation. Each development's water and wastewater capacity reservation is determined using unique attributes for various facilities that estimate water demand. The non-residential attributes are based on the guidelines presented in FAC Chapter 64E, which is included as Appendix A of the impact fee report. FAC Chapter 64E is a recognized source of estimating water and wastewater demands of non-residential enterprises throughout the State of Florida. The estimated demand per development unit is then multiplied by the appropriate charge per gallon to calculate the appropriate water and wastewater impact fees and accrued guaranteed revenue charges.

(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-252. - Exemptions. 
(a)  It is the intent of this article that all new users (connections) or new demand on the system created through expansions or renovations, pay its apportioned share of capital costs and carrying costs as outlined in section 30-254; therefore, all impact fees and AGRCs calculated are to be collected. The purpose of this section is to encourage development of affordable housing through the use of other available funds. When other available funds are designated and available for economic development incentives, the City of Hallandale Beach reserves the right to waive direct payment of the impact fees and/or AGRCs by the developer and to pay the charges from the other available funds account. 
(b)  Applicants for building permits who wish to seek an exemption from water and wastewater impact fees and/or AGRCs shall apply for the exemption on forms prescribed by the city manager or his/her designee. The applicant must certify that the property is within a community redevelopment district and that upon completion the dwelling unit(s) will qualify as affordable housing and will be maintained as affordable housing in accordance to city policy after issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the dwelling units are not maintained as affordable housing, then the impact fees and/or AGRCS which would have been payable but for this exemption shall be due and payable at once, prorated on an annual basis for the number of years less than the amount designated by city policy during which the dwelling units will not be maintained as affordable housing. 
(c)  Any exemption sought must be approved by the city manager or his/her designee before it takes effect. Applicants will be expected to meet with the city manager or his/her designee to provide evidence in support of their claim to an exemption. No exemption shall be automatic and it shall be within the sole discretion of the city manager or his/her designee whether to grant or deny any exemption, based not only on the criteria specified herein to qualify for the exemption but also on the availability of other available funds and such other considerations as the city manager or his/her designee deems appropriate in the public interest. 
(d)  No other exemptions and/or provisions are expressed or implied by this section. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-253. - Required time of payment. 
    Impact fees and AGRCs must be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit. A building permit will not be issued until these fees have been paid. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-254. - Financing policy. 
(a)  In order to be eligible for financing required payments of water and/or wastewater impact fees and AGRCs, the cumulative fees must exceed $20,000.00. In addition, the development or project for which financing is being sought must qualify either as affordable housing as defined in this article, or must constitute a commercial or industrial venture. 
(b)  Any applicant who seeks to finance impact fees and AGRCs shall apply on forms promulgated by the city manager or his/her designee, and shall include with the application proof of qualification as affordable housing, or a commercial or industrial venture. Any application for financing must be approved by the city manager or his/her designee, which shall have sole discretion to approve or reject any application based on the criteria in this article, the financial health and status of the trust funds created by this article, and such other factors as the city manager or his/her designee deems relevant in the public interest. Financing of impact fees and AGRCs is not a matter of right. 
(c)  Financing terms. 
(1)  Financing will be established at a five-year fixed rate, which the rate shall be equal to the prime rate which is available at that time at local banking institutions. 
(2)  The customer shall pay 20 percent of the total impact fees and AGRCs at the time financing is extended and the balance shall be paid over five years and the deferred balance shall bear interest at the prime rate available at local banks on the date the financing is extended. 
(3)  The impact fee and AGRC obligation shall be paid in monthly installments. 
(4)  The balance due to the city may be paid in full at any time before the maturity date without payment of penalty. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-255. - Water and wastewater impact fee reserve accounts established. 
(a)  There is hereby established two non-lapsing reserve accounts: the water impact fee reserve account and wastewater impact fee reserve account. 
(b)  Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be placed in the appropriate reserve account. 
(c)  Funds withdrawn from the water impact fee reserve account and wastewater impact fee reserve account shall be used in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-256. - Use of impact fee funds. 
    At least once each fiscal year, the city Manager or his/her designee shall present to the city commission a proposed capital improvement program for water and wastewater services assigning funds from the impact fee reserve accounts to specific improvement projects and related capital costs. Monies not assigned in any fiscal year shall be retained in the impact fee reserve accounts until the next fiscal year. 
(1)  Debt service. In the event that bonds or other debt instruments are issued for advance provision of water production and distribution capital requirements and/or wastewater collection capital requirements for which the impact fees were intended to fund the growth related demands, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or other debt instruments to the extent that the proceeds of the bonds (and a pro rata share of the cost of issuance) are expended upon the capital facilities. 
(2)  Water production and distribution services. Funds collected for water production and distribution services can be used for the purpose of acquiring or expanding capital equipment and/or facilities under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(3)  Wastewater collection/transmission services. Funds collected for wastewater collection/transmission services can be used for the purpose of acquiring or expanding capital equipment and/or facilities under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(4)  Wastewater treatment services. Funds collected for wastewater treatment services can be used for the purpose of either payment for qualified expenses at the southern regional wastewater treatment plant or for the purpose of acquiring or expanding capital equipment and/or facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2014-22, § 2, 8-20-2014) 
Sec. 30-257. - Personal liability, lien for collection. 
(a)  Any person securing a building permit, and any person performing activities for which a building permit is required, and all owners of the land upon which such activities are performed, shall be jointly and severally liable for the water and wastewater impact fees and AGRCs imposed by this article. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the city may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect such fee from any or all of such persons as provided by law. The term "person" means any natural person, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, firm or other entity or organization, and with regard to any entity which is not a natural person, shall include the officers and directors of any corporation; the general partners of any general or limited partnership, the members of any limited liability company, and the equity owners of any other entity not specifically listed. 
(b)  Failure to pay the water and/or wastewater impact fees and AGRCs when determined by the city as required to satisfy the impact of development shall result in the amount becoming a lien against the property, as provided for herein. The city shall provide written notice of the fees due by one of the following: 
(1)  Personal service; 
(2)  Certified United States mail, return receipt requested; or 
(3)  Federal Express or other equivalent overnight letter carrier. 
(c)  Upon failure to pay the fees within 30 days of the date of notice, a notice of lien shall be served by one of the following: 
(1)  Personal service; 
(2)  Certified United States mail, return receipt requested; or 
(3)  Federal Express or other equivalent overnight letter carrier, advising the property owner that the city shall file a claim of lien against the property in question. 
(d)  Once recorded, the claim of lien may be foreclosed as provided for in F.S. chs. 170 and 173, or in the same manner as a real estate mortgage, or in any other manner now or hereafter specified by applicable law. The lien for unpaid impact fees shall be coequal with the lien for state, county, special district, and other taxes and superior in right to all other liens and encumbrances, including mortgages and judgment liens regardless of the date of creation or perfection thereof. The liens shall have duration of 20 years from the date of issuance of the building permit.

For the purposes of compliance with the legislative intent of this chapter, affording the developer a fair, impartial and expeditious review of his proposed plat of subdivision or plans of required improvements and further to afford all concerned and interested parties to the proposed plat of subdivision or plans of required improvements the opportunity for comments, three cumulative levels of planning, design, surveying and engineering are established. Conceptual plans are less detailed than are preliminary plats, which are less detailed than are final plats. 
(b)  Conceptual plans. 
(1)  A conceptual plan is a graphic representation of a concept of development and shall be submitted for all subdivisions or resubdivisions of land containing more than ten acres in gross site area. Conceptual plans shall be at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 200 feet. 
(2)  Conceptual plans shall be prepared by a registered engineer, registered surveyor, registered landscape architect, registered architect or professional urban planner. The information required to be shown on conceptual plans shall be the basis for preparing the preliminary and final plats. When conceptual plans are submitted they shall contain but are not limited to the following information: 
a.  Proposed subdivision name and any previous or former subdivision names, north arrow, scale and date. 
b.  Name and address of the owner; where a corporation or company is the owner of the subject subdivision, the name and address of the president and secretary of the corporation shall be shown. 
c.  A general vicinity map. 
d.  Boundaries and dimensions of the tract. 
e.  Existing zoning of the tract and all adjacent property. 
f.  Existing and proposed major drainage patterns and drainage courses. 
g.  Existing and proposed rights-of-way. 
h.  Adjacent rights-of-way and how they connect to the tract and how any proposed rights-of-way will connect to any adjacent unsubdivided or unplatted land. All proposed rights-of-way shall conform to the county trafficways plan as adopted by the county planning council. 
i.  Development specifications of the tract, including but not limited to: 
1.  Area of the tract in square feet and acres to the nearest tenth. 
2.  Proposed number of lots. 
3.  Amount and location of all land to be dedicated or reserved for all public and private uses, including rights-of-way, easements and the like.

5.  All existing and proposed property lines. 
j.  Name, business address and telephone number of those individuals responsible for the preparation of the drawing. 
k.  Such additional information as may be required by the director. 
(c)  Preliminary plat. A preliminary plat is an initial design solution to a concept of development. Preliminary plats shall be at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 100 feet and may be submitted for all subdivisions or resubdivisions of land. Preliminary plats shall be prepared by a registered surveyor. A registered engineer, registered architect, registered landscape architect or professional urban planner may provide assistance in the preparation of preliminary plats. When preliminary plats are submitted and no conceptual plan has been previously submitted, the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall be complied with on additional drawings as necessary. The preliminary plat shall contain the following information: 
(1)  The location of any underground or overhead utilities, culverts, and drains on the property to be subdivided. 
(2)  Location, names and widths of existing and proposed streets, easements, building lines, alleys, parks and other open public spaces and similar facts regarding adjacent property.

Sec. 32-100. - Construction of required improvements. 
    Methods of construction shall be those prescribed by the current "Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" and the county engineering department when applicable. 
(1)  Construction in floodprone areas. Property with a history of inundation or known poor foundation conditions or any other natural conditions which prevent or limit the use of standard construction methods on building sites shall not be accepted for platting or subdivision purposes until a complete development plan is approved by the director, board and city commission. This development plan shall provide for all necessary filling and demucking of the land, complete drainage and type of foundations to be used on all proposed construction. Elevations and grades of all lots, streets and alleys shall be approved by the director, board and city commission based on past records of flood levels and high tides in the area of proposed development. 
(2)  Administration of construction. After approval of the final plat, construction plans and supplementary material, a developer may construct the required improvements subject to obtaining all required permits. The director shall be notified at least 72 hours in advance of the date of commencement of such construction. Construction shall be performed under the surveillance of, and shall at all times be subject to review by, the director. This shall in no way relieve the developer and his engineer of the responsibility for close field coordination and final compliance with the approved plans, specifications necessary to construct the required improvements and the requirements of this chapter. The developer shall employ a registered engineer for complete administration of the construction of all approved required improvements. The developer shall require that progress reports and final certification of the construction of the required improvements from such engineer be filed with the director. The director shall have the right to enter the property for the purpose of reviewing the construction of the required improvements during the progress of such construction. The developer's engineer shall coordinate joint reviews of the construction with the director. The director shall have the authority to stop the work upon failure of the developer or his engineer to coordinate the construction of the required improvements as prescribed by this chapter. 
(3)  Measurements and tests. Current state DOT procedures for testing shall be used as specified in the "Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction" (1973 edition). During construction, the developer's engineer shall make such measurements, field tests and laboratory tests or cause them to be made to certify that the work and materials conform with the approved development plans and the provisions of this chapter. The director may require tests and measurements which he deems necessary. 
(4)  Completion certificate. The required improvements shall not be considered complete until a completion certificate along with the final project records have been furnished to and reviewed and approved by the director. The certificate shall be by the developer's engineer stating that the required improvements were installed under his responsible direction and that the improvements conform with the approved construction plans and specifications. The developer's engineer shall also furnish a copy of each of the construction plans showing the original design in comparison to the actual finished work and a copy of the measurements, tests and reports made on the work and material during the progress of the construction. 
(5)  Time extensions. All required improvements shall be completed within 12 months from the date of recording of the final plat; or if construction of improvements is undertaken prior to recording to final plat, improvements shall be completed prior to the approval of the final plat. Time extensions may be granted by the director at the request of the developer when, in the opinion of the director, undue hardship or conditions exist beyond the control of the developer. No extension of time shall exceed 12 months. If improvements are not completed within the prescribed time period, the director shall recommend to the city commission that any bond or surety be forfeited for the purpose of completing the required improvements. 
(6)  Sidewalk guarantee. The city commission may waive, on an interim basis, the required sidewalk construction, during the active construction phase of the required improvements. Any such waiver shall be conditioned upon the developer's posting of a separate sidewalk improvement guarantee bond or surety for a period not to exceed two years. The legal form and sufficiency of the bond shall be approved by the city attorney. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. X, § 30) 
Sec. 32-101. - Dedication, acceptance and maintenance of required improvements. 
(a)  Acceptance of dedications and maintenance of improvements. 
(1)  The dedication or granting of public open space, parks, rights-of-way, easements and like public areas on the plat shall not be effective until the plat is approved and executed by the appropriate city officials. Approval and execution of the plat by such officials shall, unless otherwise stated, constitute an acceptance of the offer to dedicate or grant. 
(2)  If any improvements are required or proposed to be constructed by the developer in such public right-of-way or areas, the city will not be responsible for maintenance of those improvements until the director has certified that they have been completed in accordance with all legal requirements and they have been specifically accepted by a separate resolution of the city and the bonds guaranteeing such construction have been released by the city. 
(b)  Completion of required improvements. When a plat has been recorded and the developer fails to complete the required improvements as required by this chapter, the city may complete the required improvements under the guarantees or sureties provided by the developer. In such case, the city commission may direct the director to call upon the guarantees to secure satisfactory completion of the required improvements. The director shall report to the city commission, and the city commission may accept by resolution the dedications and maintenance responsibility as indicated on the plat. In such cases, the remaining guarantees posted by the developer shall be retained for a period of one year after completion in lieu of the maintenance bond or surety. Any defects occurring during this period shall be repaired using the funds remaining from the guarantee. 
(c)  Failure to complete unrecorded subdivisions. Where a developer has elected to install the required improvements prior to recordation of the plat and fails to initiate or make substantial progress on such improvements within 12 months from the date of approval of required improvements plans, all approvals of the subdivision shall be null and void; and the land shall revert to its original status. The sale of lots or issuance of building permits shall be permanently suspended unless the plat has been resubmitted with all of the supplementary material and approvals as prescribed in this section have been granted. 
(d)  Maintenance bond after project completion. The developer shall provide a maintenance bond or surety in the amount of ten percent of the estimated construction and engineering costs guaranteeing the required improvements against defect in workmanship and material for one year upon acceptance of such improvements by both the county and the city. This maintenance bond or surety shall be submitted to the director, along with the completion certificate and project records.

(1)  Centerlines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways and alleys shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(2)  Lot, section and tract lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines, section or tract lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
(3)  Political boundaries. Boundaries indicated as approximately following political boundaries shall be construed as following such political boundaries. 
(4)  Railroad lines. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be the centerline of the railroad right-of-way. 
(5)  Shoreline. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be constructed to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of canals or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(6)  Parallel lines. Boundaries that are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, the centerlines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerline or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning maps. 
(7)  Bisecting lines. Boundaries that approximately bisect a block, lot or tract shall be construed to follow the median lines of such blocks, as indicated by rear property lines or as measured between the centerlines of boundary streets in the absence of rear property lines or in the absence of both of the above, by use of the scale appearing on the zoning maps. 
(8)  Uncertainties. Where features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in case any other uncertainty exists, the city commission shall interpret the intent of the official zoning map as to the location of district boundaries. 
(9)  Street abandonments. Where a public road, street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street or alley. 
(10)  Excluded areas. Where parcels of land have been inadvertently excluded from a zoning district classification in any manner, such parcels shall be classified as RS-5 until rezoned. 
(b)  When use district regulations specifically incorporate the permitted uses of another use district, those permitted uses shall be subject to the requirements of the incorporating district, unless otherwise specified. 
(c)  Where a permitted use is first specified in a use district, that use may only be permitted in that district and any district incorporating its permitted uses. 
(d)  Unless otherwise specified, all height regulations shall be measured from the finished grade, as that term is defined in the South Florida Building code. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 3) 
Sec. 32-134. - Rules for allowing uses not specifically listed in zoning districts. 
    Where ambiguity exists as to whether a proposed use is allowed in a particular zoning district, the director of development services will determine, upon request, if the proposed use is substantially similar to a listed use and if the expected impacts on nearby property are not materially greater than a listed use. The director will issue this determination in writing.

Sec. 32-159. - CCB central city business district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent.

(1)  Development proposals within the business district may be reviewed under three alternate procedures: the standard method as required pursuant to article V of this chapter; as a PDO planned development overlay; and under the quality development incentive program. Each alternative is further described below. 
a.  The standard method permits the applicant to undertake development under the major/minor development review process pursuant to article V of this chapter. This method is only applicable to those projects that meet all standards listed in this district. 
b.  The PDO planned development overlay method permits the applicant to negotiate development details through a development agreement pursuant to section 32-186(d). The applicant must rezone the applicable property to the PDO planned development overlay designation. 
c.  The quality development incentive program adopted by the design guidelines manual shall permit the applicant to negotiate for greater densities or modified minimum standards in exchange for certain amenities or maintenance and/or improvements to public facilities. Such negotiation shall be filed with the city manager, who shall transmit the request to the city commission accompanied by a staff recommendation. Such requests shall be advertised, posted and noticed in conformity with the requirements of section 32-967 as to variances. Modifications to density or development standards are limited by the city's comprehensive plan. This procedure is more expeditious and less expensive since the property is not required to be rezoned PDO. The application fee for quality development incentive program shall be the same as the city's fee schedule for variances for business districts. 
(2)  Properties currently under PDO development agreements will not be subject to the business district requirements unless their agreements are renegotiated based upon major changes. 
(h)  Supplemental standards. 
(1)  Nightclubs, dance halls and discotheques, including those with entertainment, shall be located at least 100 horizontal feet from any residential use or district. 
(2)  Existing nonconforming development within the financial district may only expand or redevelop in conformance with section 32-921 or through the quality development incentive program. 
(3)  If a property cannot adequately support a two-story building, the commission may waive this requirement or other applicable requirements in CCB upon making a finding that: 
a.  The proposal by the applicant meets the purpose and intent of the CCB and makes provision to comply with district regulations on an equivalent or greater basis. 
b.  In the particular circumstance, strict application of a CCB regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of stated district purposes. 
(4)  Awnings, marquees, arcades or other architectural features which provide pedestrian protection from sun and inclement weather are encouraged. These elements should be designed so as to not interfere with pedestrian movement through the area. 
(5)  Upon submission of a development application within the CCB, the applicant shall focus on open space opportunities in areas with existing or projected peak pedestrian activity. The applicant shall coordinate open space plans with adjoining property owners. Such open spaces should include natural or artificially shaded areas. 
(6)  Site design for new structures and redevelopment projects shall review possible streetscape improvements and consider the following elements: 
a.  Open space/mini-parks; 
b.  Pedestrian scale site amenities; 
c.  Seating (benches/low walls/wide planter edges); 
d.  Signage; 
e.  Trash receptacles, bollards and bus shelters; 
f.  Brick and decorative concrete paving patterns; 
g.  Fountains and public art; 
h.  Enhanced pedestrian crosswalks; and 
i.  Wider sidewalks. 
(7)  When practicable and appropriate, developments which have parking in front of the building line and which exceed the property's off-street parking requirement will be encouraged to reduce the extent of the setback nonconformity when expansion or changes of use are proposed. The altered parking/setback area can be converted to landscape area, public/private open space or reserved for building expansion if applicable. 
(8)  Prior to submitting a development application with the city, the developer should consult with the growth management department for input concerning design guidelines and possible amenities and public facilities during negotiation under the quality development incentive program. 
(i)  General regulations. Applicable general regulations are as follows: 
(1)  Supplemental regulations, section 32-331 et seq. 
(2)  Development review procedure, section 32-781 et seq. 
(3)  Off-street parking and loading regulations, section 32-451 et seq. 
a.  Parking requirements for standard development within this district will follow section 32-451 et seq. To accommodate limited speculation within multiuse buildings, parking requirements will be based on the expected use. Additional parking or parking mitigation will only be required if actual parking requirements continually exceed proposed parking. 
b.  To better accommodate the actual needs of development, the city commission may permit the deferral of parking for larger or multiuse projects under a parking deferral program. For a parking deferral to be considered, a developer must demonstrate one or more of the following: 
1.  Through transmittal of a parking study, evidence that the parking requirement for the particular project is less than the requirement per this Code. The parking study shall be prepared by a licensed traffic engineer. 
2.  Public transportation satisfies transportation demand for a portion of the users of the facility that correspond to the amount of parking sought to be deferred. 
3.  The developer has established or will establish an alternative means of access to the use that will justify deferring the number of parking spaces sought to be deferred. Alternative programs that may be considered include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Private shuttles and public car pools and van pools; 
ii.  Provision of parking elsewhere in the district; 
iii.  Flexible work hour scheduling; 
iv.  Capital improvement for transit services; 
v.  Ride sharing; and 
vi.  Any other alternative program proposed by the developer that meets the consideration of the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-31, § 15, adopted Nov. 5, 2014, changed the title of Subdiv. II from "Special Uses" to read as herein set out. 

Sec. 32-171. - PLAC planned local activity center district. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. The following standards, regulations and requirements apply to areas to be rezoned as a planned local activity center (PLAC) district within the city. The PLAC district regulations are created to ensure development within a local activity center (LAC) future land use category is consistent with LAC land use designation. The PLAC is intended to encourage and promote development that facilitates a coordinated and balanced mix of land uses, including: retail, office, hotel/conference, certain types of commercial recreation uses, residential and other similar uses. The mix of land uses associated with the PLAC district shall also provide recreation, entertainment, and associated employment opportunities while creating an urban center with high quality architecture, pedestrian-friendly streets, outdoor public spaces and access to public transit. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Design guidelines mean a document created and submitted in conjunction with a planned local activity center rezoning and a major development plan approval application that describes the architectural and design goals of a specific development within the PLAC. The guidelines shall include a description and intent of the overall development and provide standards for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, architecture, landscaping, open space, signage, parking (surface and structured), loading, streets, and regulations addressing building placement, scale/massing, height, and character. 
    The PLAC design guidelines standards and criteria shall take precedent over the conceptual site plan design. 
    Development agreement means a valid and enforceable agreement between an applicant for a development approval and the city. The development agreement shall set forth any conditions and obligations to address impacts of the development on the city, shall be recorded in the public records and shall be binding on all property owners within the boundaries of the development. The development agreement shall be utilized to further the purpose and intent of PLAC set forth in subsection (a) of this section. No building permit shall be issued until a development agreement is signed. 
    Major development plan means a detailed proposal which incorporates specific site details and specifications including a site plan and other documents as required by subsection (h) of this section and the development review requirements of article V of this chapter. 
    Planned local activity center (PLAC) means an area zoned as a dense, urban, mixed-use development area to achieve an interdependent live/work/entertainment environment while also enhancing the quality of life in the city and minimizing the demand and dependence on the automobile. 
(c)  Applicability means the city commission may zone lands as a PLAC district consistent with the intent and purpose of the LAC land use category in the city's comprehensive plan. 
(d)  Permitted, accessory and prohibited uses. 
(1)  Permitted uses. Uses consistent with or customary to mixed-use urban centers including but not limited to multi-family residential, office, retail and commercial uses including cinemas, nightclubs, café/restaurants, hotels, accessory parking, and certain commercial recreation uses. The following commercial recreation uses shall be permitted as accessory uses indoors in facilities that are licensed to serve alcoholic beverages: simulcasting screens and pari-mutuel wagering machines. Slot gaming facilities and casinos are prohibited. 
(2)  Accessory uses. Accessory uses include uses customarily accessory to the principal permitted use but not including any of the uses listed as prohibited. 
(3)  Temporary uses. Temporary uses and structures, such as trailers, in connection with sales, marketing, leasing, construction or development subject to the following restrictions: 
a.  Temporary uses and structures shall only be permitted as part of a conceptual site plan and approved design guidelines. The approval shall include a duration of not more than two years or when the first component or building is completed, whichever is earlier. 
b.  Construction trailers shall only be permitted for the duration of a construction phase, beginning with the date a building permit is issued and continuing not longer than the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development. 
c.  The city manager may extend the approved duration in increments of no more than two years upon finding that the temporary use or structure is necessary to facilitate completion of the development. 
d.  A designated parking area with a minimum of 20 parking spaces as approved by the city manager shall be provided in connection with the use of a sales trailer. 
(4)  Prohibited uses. Any use not consistent and/or compatible with the permitted and accessory uses established in the LAC land use category text for the specific project area, the PLAC district design guidelines, and specifically prohibiting the following: single-family and duplex residential (not including townhouses), mobile homes, retail sales of secondhand merchandise, auto sales and repair, gas stations, boat yards, warehouse/storage, heavy commercial uses, industrial uses, and any use not specifically permitted and/or compatible with the intended development as determined by the city. 
(e)  PLAC district criteria. Consistent with the LAC land use category requirements in the city's comprehensive plan and the county land use plan, the following criteria must be met for an area to be eligible for designation as a PLAC district: 
(1)  Minimum/maximum lot size. The minimum area or lot size considered for the PLAC district shall be contiguous ten acres. The maximum area or lot size considered for the PLAC district shall be 160 acres. At such time as 75 percent of the originally zoned PLAC district is developed, an expansion to the subject PLAC district to include abutting properties may be considered without regard to minimum size requirements. 
(2)  Proximity to public transportation. Seventy-five percent of the land within the proposed PLAC district must be located within a quarter-mile of public transit, a community shuttle or multi-modal facilities, or are designed, built and located within a quarter-mile of such facilities upon build-out. Where such facilities are not in place or planned to be in place at the time of the rezoning, design standards shall be required in the design guidelines to ensure that the primary priority is a safe, comfortable, and attractive pedestrian environment that will allow convenient connection to public transit, will reduce the number of automobile trips internally, and will ultimately support an integrated multimodal transportation system. 
(3)  [Appropriate depth and frontage.] A proposed PLAC district must have a geographic configuration of appropriate depth and frontage to support the location of uses in a manner oriented around a five-minute (i.e., quarter-mile) walk. Multiple nodes of activity oriented around a five-minute walk may be included within one PLAC district. 
(f)  General PLAC district requirements. All development within a PLAC district shall conform to the following requirements unless modified by a development agreement enacted pursuant to subsection 32-173(d)(2) by the city commission. 
(1)  Setbacks. All buildings, structures and additions shall meet the setback requirements defined in the approved design guidelines required in subsection (h). 
(2)  Height. Building heights shall comply with the height standards established in the approved design guidelines. At no time shall a building be higher than 30 stories. As one of the main purposes of the PLAC is to create a dense urban appearance, buildings should be designed in such a manner to avoid the appearance of a one-story "strip commercial" building. To that end, portions of buildings that are approved as one-story structures must be designed in a manner that the average parapet height is at least 20 feet above grade. 
(3)  Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be designed and calculated pursuant to section 32-452 of this Code, entitled "Off-street parking requirements," or as approved in the PLAC design guidelines and major development plan approval. In general, shared parking shall be encouraged to permit a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces for individual uses in mixed-use projects which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time or patrons that may visit a number of uses within the project. The city may approve a reduction in the quantity, location or type of required parking spaces based on the submission of a professional parking study acceptable to the city. 
(4)  Landscaping. All property or parcels within a PLAC shall conform to the requirements in section 32-384, entitled "Landscape requirements," or as modified as part of the design guidelines. The design guidelines and subsequent major development plans shall include a planting theme consistent with South Florida landscaping and supporting a pedestrian-friendly environment. Park and open space land may include squares, plazas, arcades, landscaped pedestrian walkways, greenbelts, greenways and playgrounds. Required perimeter buffers, median strip landscaping and interior parking lot islands may not comprise more than 20 percent of the total required landscaped area. All such land must be within the boundaries of the PLAC district. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the above provisions, the city reserves the right, but is not obligated, to modify the PLAC criteria upon submission of a request from the owner/applicant. 
(g)  PLAC submittal requirements. The following shall be submitted for PLAC approval: 
(1)  General location map, boundary survey and PLAC narrative.

(2)  Conceptual site plan. A conceptual site plan illustrating the general layout of streets, sidewalks, open space, parking, and buildings and any proposed temporary uses or structures. The conceptual site plan drawings must have sufficient detail to clearly illustrate and denote building forms and relationships, architectural styles, setbacks, approximate sizes of uses and functional use areas including dimensions/square footages. The conceptual plan may be revised consistent with the approved design guidelines through the major development plan review/process for each phase of the development. The conceptual site plan approval is deemed conditional until a development agreement is executed by the city and applicant pursuant to the paragraph (n). 
(3)  Design guidelines. Design guidelines (text and graphics) providing specific guidelines for the PLAC district governing vehicular and pedestrian circulation, architecture (including building elevations), landscaping, open space, signage, site lighting, parking (surface and structured), loading, streets, and standards addressing building placement, scale/massing, height and character. Unless specifically modified in the design guidelines, all development in the PLAC district shall comply with the city's minimum code requirements. 
(4)  Phasing plan. An anticipated development phasing schedule including the sequence for each phase, and approximate size of the area in each phase of the PLAC district consistent with the conceptual plan. 
(5)  Infrastructure assessment. An assessment of the infrastructure necessary to serve the PLAC including potable water, sanitary sewer, stormwater, electricity, telephone, gas installation, cable TV, satellite communication facilities, solid waste and waste disposal facilities, loading zones and proposed street improvements. 
(6)  Recreation and open space assessment. An assessment of designated recreational opportunities and open spaces within the PLAC district addressing conformance to the goals, objectives and policies of the city's comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. Residual areas such as buffers, median strips and retention areas are not considered parkland or open space but may be counted toward minimum landscape requirements. 
(7)  Transportation and parking analysis. A transportation and parking analysis including on-site and off-site vehicular traffic, mass transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities. 
(8)  Security measure assessment. An assessment and description of any security measures to be provided within the general area and sub-areas of the PLAC.

Subdivision IV. - Planned Development Overlays 

Sec. 32-186. - PDO planned development overlay. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the PDO planned development overlay is to provide an optional zoning procedure to permit site design flexibility and greater land use intensity and density in order to encourage high-quality, innovative development that is consistent with comprehensive plan policies, applicable city development and redevelopment plans, and desired development patterns and land uses in an overlay zone that encourages flexibility in the design and negotiation of land development in order to promote its most appropriate use; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and to ensure that development is planned, designed, and developed to function as integral units independently or in concert with the existing land use pattern and adjacent building sites. Regulations for planned development are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other applicable city regulations to the same degree as in instances where such city regulations are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot basis rather than on a unified development approach. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City-initiated rezoning means the assignment of PDO by the city commission to areas of the city where the commission desires to direct development or redevelopment activity which satisfies the intent of this district. 
    Concept plan means a preliminary presentation and attendant documentation required for the assignment of PDO to land by an applicant other than the city commission in accordance with the requirements outlined in subsection (g) of this section; a plan of sufficient accuracy to be used for the purpose of discussion and consideration. 
    Major development plan means a detailed plan which represents a specific development plan including specifications required by subsection (h) of this section and the development review requirements of article V of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
    Planned development overlay (PDO) means an overlay district assigned to land developed or proposed to be developed according to a plan; as a single entity under unified control; planned and developed as a whole in a single phase or an approved series of phases. It may contain one or more structures with appurtenant common areas. 
(c)  Unified control. All land included for the purpose of development within a PDO planned development overlay shall be either part of an adopted city-initiated rezoning, or under the control of the applicant (an individual, partnership or corporation, or group of individuals, partnerships or corporations). The applicant shall present satisfactory legal documents to constitute evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed planned development which shall be certified by the city manager. The applicant shall agree in the application for rezoning to the following: 
(1)  To proceed with the proposed development according to the provisions of this chapter and the approved plan; 
(2)  To provide, subsequent to rezoning and prior to the issuance of a building permit, any agreements, contracts, covenants, deed restrictions or sureties as reasonably deemed necessary by the city, in a form acceptable to the city, to ensure that the development proceeds in accordance with prior approvals and to further provide for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated, or maintained at public expense; 
(3)  To bind their successors in title to any commitments made as set forth in this subsection; and 
(4)  If the developer elects to administer common open space through an association or nonprofit corporation, the organization shall conform to the applicable laws of the state. 
(d)  Status. 
(1)  Overlay zone. The PDO planned development overlay shall be an overlay zone that can be applied in locations within the city. 
(2)  Development agreement required. Each PDO planned development overlay development shall be governed by a development agreement whereby the city and other appropriate entities enter as parties to the agreement. The development agreement shall be utilized to further the purpose and intent of PDO set forth in subsections (a) and (i) of this section. 
(3)  Guidelines. Guidelines for the PDO planned development overlay 3.1 administrative process and 3.2 dimension and design guidelines are set forth in the city design guidelines manual maintained in the growth management department and adopted by reference in this section. 
(4)  Review; agreement required. In cases whereby a property has no existing development agreement or major development plan of record but has been rezoned to the PDO overlay zoning designation, any further development or redevelopment shall require major development review and a development agreement with the city. This provision is mandatory in all cases, including the event where the proposed development does not meet the standards for submission of major development plan review. 
(e)  Uses permitted. The uses permitted in a planned development, as indicated below, must be consistent with the provisions of this section and, in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan: 
(1)  In order to achieve the purpose of this section, a PDO planned development overlay may be developed as a residential, business, industrial or mixed use entity and shall be identified as: 
PDO residential PDO/R PDO business PDO/B PDO industrial PDO/I PDO mixed use PDO/M  
Within each PDO planned development overlay, uses listed in the underlying zoning district may be permitted subject to major development plan review and the limitations of the applicable future land use designation of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  In situations whereby PDO is applied to a general area rather than a unified single area or tract, singular parcels may be allowed to develop consistent with the underlying zoning district provided such development is not inconsistent with the future development scheme for the entire general area designated PDO. The city manager shall make this determination based upon a statement supplied by the applicant that describes how such underlying zoning district utilization will promote and advance the interest of PDO and not impact the future development of the entire general area designated PDO. If a singular parcel is exempted by the city manager, no development agreement will be required and the plan shall be reviewed as provided in this chapter. 
(f)  Procedures for city-initiated rezoning. Where the city initiates a rezoning to PDO based on a development or redevelopment plan, the PDO provisions shall serve to further the recommendations, goals and policies of that plan. Proposed developments within a city-initiated PDO will be evaluated for their consistency with the city's goals and policies relating to the area being proposed for development or redevelopment. The development or redevelopment plan shall serve as the concept plan as specified in subsection (g)(4) of this section, for all included land. Subsequent applications for development in the PDO shall constitute the major development plan and shall be substantially consistent with the recommendations, goals and policies of the concept plan. Application fees for a major development plan on a city-initiated PDO shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
(g)  Procedures and requirements for rezoning to a PDO planned development overlay. 
(1)  An application for a rezoning to PDO planned development overlay shall be made only by the owner of the subject property or an authorized agent and processed in the same manner as other applications for rezoning of land as provided in section 32-966, except as otherwise provided in these regulations. 
(2)  The rezoning application fees for a PDO planned development overlay shall be as set forth for rezoning applications in the city's fee schedule. 
(3)  Applications for rezoning to PDO planned development overlay may be submitted for review as a concept plan in the absence of a major development plan that meets the requirements of subsection (h) of this section. 
(4)  Applications for rezoning to PDO planned development overlay based on a concept plan shall provide the following information for review: 
a.  A certified boundary survey. 
b.  General schematic representation of the land uses with densities and intensities, along with a table of computation which depicts number of units, gross floor area, parking, building height and site coverage. 
c.  Approximate delineation of internal circulation, with hierarchical classification of streets. 
(5)  Applications for rezoning to PDO shall be reviewed with consideration given to the following criteria: 
a.  That the proposed project would further the development or redevelopment of an area of the city consistent with city land use and development goals, policies and development/redevelopment efforts. 
b.  That the proposed development would be of an equal or higher quality with regard to appearance, site design, compatibility with the adjacent area, landscaping, and provision of amenities that would result under the existing development standards. 
c.  That PDO would allow a more innovative design than would be possible under the development standards of the existing zoning district and development regulations. 
d.  That the proposed development would promote the public interest, including, if appropriate, the provision of open space and amenities available for public use. 
e.  That mixed commercial and residential development proposals would be well planned, in an integrated design that would encourage use of mass transportation, pedestrian and bicycling modes of transportation. 
f.  That it would be more appropriate for a proposed project to be developed under PDO development standards and procedures than the existing zoning district development standards, and development review and variance procedures, when the criteria mentioned in this subsection are considered. 
(h)  Procedures and requirements for major development plan. 
(1)  The application fees for major development plan in a PDO planned development overlay shall be those adopted in the city's fee schedule for concurrency evaluation and development review. 
(2)  An application for a major development in a PDO planned development overlay shall conform to the requirements for development review as provided in article V of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(3)  In addition to the requirements of article V of this chapter, the following shall be submitted for major development plan approval:

Sec. 32-192. - Regulating plan showing Central RAC subdistricts. 
(a)  The locations and boundaries of the Central RAC subdistricts shall be shown on both a map entitled "City of Hallandale Beach Zoning Map" and a map entitled "Hallandale Beach Central RAC Regulating Plan." The Hallandale Beach Central RAC Regulating Plan depicts additional information necessary to apply the standards contained in this section and is hereby officially adopted as an integral part of these regulations. To create the vibrant, diverse character envisioned for the Central RAC, six subdistricts are hereby created and assigned to land, as shown on both a map entitled, "Hallandale Beach Zoning Map" and a map entitled, "Hallandale Beach Central RAC Regulating Plan": 
(1)  RAC Corridor. 
(2)  Transit Core. 
(3)  RAC Neighborhood. 
(4)  Transitional Mixed Use. 
(5)  Fashion Art Design (FAD). 
(6)  Greyhound Track. 
(b)  The Hallandale Beach Central RAC Regulating Plan depicts additional information necessary to apply the standards contained in this division and is hereby officially adopted as an integral part of these regulations. 
(1)  Primary and secondary streets . Primary streets are intended to develop overtime as superior pedestrian environments and, as such, are held to higher standards in the regulations regarding building placement, building frontage, and the location of parking and service uses. Streets not designated as primary streets are considered secondary streets, which will accommodate service functions and vehicular-oriented development needs including parking, loading, and drive-through facilities. 
(2)  Future connections . Potential future connections are illustrated on the regulating plan. Future connections are desired new vehicular and/or pedestrian connections to, or extensions of, existing streets or alleys that will improve the overall transportation network. Future connection designations are not precise alignments or specific locations. The appropriateness of and final street designation, alignment, location, and dedication of these intended links of the transportation network will be determined during the development review process by the city commission. 
(3)  General location of the Tri-Rail Coastal Link Station . The general location of the planned Tri-Rail Coastal Link station is mapped on the regulating plan. The station area supports the more intense subdistricts of the RAC and parking requirements are adjusted based on the proximity to this transportation resource.

Sec. 32-194. - Configuration of buildings. 
(a)  Building height . Unless otherwise specified herein, the height of buildings shall be measured in and regulated by the number of stories. Increasing the maximum number of stories allowed in a Central RAC subdistrict may not be approved as a variance or waiver. Stories are measured from the floor to the bottom of the lowest structural member that supports the story above. See Figure 32-194(a). 
(1)  Stories located below grade are not counted for the purpose of measuring building height. In all subdistricts, if this floor is elevated more than five feet above the adjacent sidewalk or, if no sidewalk is in place more than five feet above the crown of the adjacent street, the space below counts as the ground (first) story for the purposes of measuring building height. 
(2)  The ground story of commercial or mixed-use buildings shall be ten feet to 18 feet tall; any ground story taller than 18 feet will count as two stories for the purpose of measuring building height. In cases where the first story must be taller to accommodate internal waste disposal, the first floor is permitted a maximum height of 22 feet and will count as one story. 
(3)  The ground story of residential buildings shall be nine feet to 14 feet tall. 
(4)  Each story above the ground story in all buildings must be nine feet to 12 feet tall; any upper story taller than 12 feet will count as two stories for the purpose of measuring building height. 
(5)  Mezzanines that exceed the percentage of floor area for a mezzanine defined in the Florida Building Code are counted as a story for the purpose of measuring height. 
(6)  Each parking garage level exposed to a street or civic open space shall be counted as a story for the purposes of measuring height. Parking levels fully concealed from view by a story containing an active use, such as residential, office, or retail, are not counted as stories for the purpose of measuring height. See Figure 32-194(b). 
(7)  Residential units must have the floor of the first habitable story elevated to at least 18 inches above the highest adjacent crown of road of all adjoining streets or regulatory freeboard above the base flood elevation (BFE), whichever is higher, in all subdistricts, except for the RAC neighborhood where the floor elevation of the first habitable story must be elevated at least 12 inches above the highest adjacent crown of road of all adjoining streets or regulatory freeboard above BFE, whichever is higher. Lobbies and common areas in multi-unit buildings can have finish floor elevations in compliance with base flood elevation (BFE) plus any regulatory freeboard. 
(8)  Flat roofs shall be enclosed by parapets no less than 42 inches high, or as required to screen equipment. 
(9)  Mechanical equipment necessary to the operation or maintenance of the building such as, but not limited to, elevator, stair, and mechanical penthouses, cooling towers, vent stacks and antennae shall be enclosed and screened in such a manner that the enclosure is an integral part of the overall building design and provides a balanced and graceful silhouette, and ameliorates the visual impact from adjacent buildings. Minor features not exceeding one foot in height shall be exempted from this regulation. The incorporation of green energy resources, such as photovoltaic cells, is encouraged; however, significant features, such as windmills, require approval by the development services director. 
(10)  Architectural features such as church spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, or similar, structures are not limited by story height.

(b)  Building placement. 
(1)  Front setbacks shall be measured from the property lines coinciding with public rights-of-way, including streets and parks, or from civic open spaces that meet the requirements in section 32-202. See Figure 32-194(c). 
Figure 32-194(c)
Building Frontage Requirement

(2)  In subdistricts that allow development with no side or rear setback, the following limitations also apply: 
a.  Side and rear setbacks are required only when an abutting property has a building existing as of the effective date of this ordinance [November 5, 2014] with windows facing the adjoining lot line. Then, new development shall set back to provide at least ten feet of separation between the existing and new buildings. 
b.  All light and air shafts, including those necessary per the percentage of openings on building facades, shall be provided within the lot pursuant to the Florida Building Code. 
(c)  Frontage percentages. Building frontage is the percentage of the total width of a lot which is required to be occupied by the primary facade of a building. Each subdistrict provides minimum building frontages. 
(1)  The primary facade shall be parallel to the right-of-way, located in accordance with the minimum and maximum front setback requirements of the subdistrict. 
(2)  The location of the primary facade is not changed by architectural elements such as cornices, bay windows, awnings, porches, balconies, stoops, colonnades, arcades or forecourts. 
(3)  The primary facade may adjust around a civic open space that meets the requirements in § 32-202 as shown in Figure 32-194(c). 
(d)  Architectural standards. In all RAC subdistricts, the following architectural standards apply: 
(1)  Building facades facing streets or civic open spaces must have transparent windows covering a minimum of 20 percent and a maximum of 75 percent of the wall area of each story as measured between finished floors. Transparent means non-solar, non-mirrored glass with a light transmission reduction of no more than 20 percent. 
(2)  Windows and doors shall be vertically proportioned. Horizontal fenestration openings can meet this requirement by using muntins to subdivide glazed areas into vertical or square areas, or by using a series of vertically proportioned windows within the opening. Transom windows may be horizontal and semi-circular windows are permitted. Circular and square windows may be used as limited accent elements within the facade. 
(3)  All parapets shall have a cornice molding extending a minimum of two inches from the surface plane of the wall. 
(4)  An expression line shall be provided at the top of the first or second story. Expression lines shall be moldings extending a minimum of two inches from the surface plane of the building wall. Expression lines are intended to be continuous facade elements and may not be covered by awnings or signs. Significant architectural elements such as columns, pilasters, and towers may interrupt expression lines. 
(5)  Building facades shall be designed to visually screen parking and minimize large expanses of blank walls. Appropriate facade design incorporates the consistent use of materials and construction assemblies, fenestration patterns, architectural articulation, and features such as, but not limited to, the application of architectural screens, louvers, or glass, and the incorporation of vegetated surfaces and planters. Paint, faux treatments, scoring, construction joints, lighting, and material projections less than two inches are permitted, but do not fulfill the facade design requirements. 
Figure 32-194(d)
Character Examples for Screening Parking and Blank Walls 
The Clematis Street garage utilizes consistent building materials with fenestration patterns to establish an attractive facade screening the parking levels over the retail space. The Lincoln Theater has the building circulation located along the streets, behind an architectural glass facade, screening the large expanses of blank walls associated with movie theaters.  
(6)  In the absence of a building facade, a streetwall is required along both primary and secondary streets. Streetwalls shall be three feet to three feet six inches in height, located in line with the building facade or the front setback. Streetwalls shall be composed of either an opaque wall using the same material and color as the building or of a continuous, maintained hedge. In addition, one shade tree per 25 lineal feet, uniformly spaced, shall be installed along the length of the streetwall. 
(7)  An opaque, masonry wall six feet in height shall be built on the property line along all side and rear lot lines that abut single-family houses existing as of the date of this ordinance (Nov. 5, 2014) or lots in a residential zoning district. In addition one shade tree shall be planted every 20 feet along the wall. 
(e)  Minimum floor area for units . Minimum floor area for multifamily residential dwelling units shall be as shown in Table 32-194(b).

(f)  Other standards. Other standards also apply to Central RAC subdistricts: 
(1)  Frontage standards are in section 32-201. 
(2)  Civic open spaces standards are in section 32-202. 
(3)  Parking standards are in section 32-203. 
(4)  Street and block standards are in section 32-204. 
(5)  RAC development approval process in section 32-205. 
(6)  RAC density allocation standards are in section 32-206. 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, § 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014; Ord. No. 2016-20, § 1, 10-19-2016) 
Sec. 32-195. - RAC Corridor subdistrict standards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The RAC Corridor subdistrict is the most intense subdistrict in the RAC, accommodating a wide range of uses, including major employment, shopping, civic, and entertainment destinations as well as residential uses.

Sec. 32-201. - Frontage standards. 
    The Central RAC subdistricts establish a predictable spatial framework to create a pedestrian-friendly environment supportive of infill redevelopment and multi-modal transportation options. Frontage standards ensure a superior pedestrian environment develops overtime that improves the overall visual appearance and use of streets. These standards define architecture and design components for the entrance(s) to buildings and the area between building facades and streets. 
(a)  Frontage types . The entrance(s) of every building shall be directly accessible from and face a public right-of-way or civic open space. Frontage types define architectural characteristics for the detailing of these building entrances. Six distinct frontage types have been identified, which are appropriate for different types of buildings and uses. Table 32-201(a) identifies the frontage types appropriate for each subdistrict by an "X". Using one or more of frontage types identified is required.

(2)  Stoop. A stoop is a small staircase leading to the entrance of a building that may be covered. The elevation of the stoop is necessary to ensure privacy for residential uses in the ground story of buildings. Stoops should provide sufficient space for a person to comfortably pause before entering or after exiting the building. Stoops are frontage types typically associated with townhouses and other residential building types. Table 32-201(c) provides the dimensional requirements and the maximum allowable encroachment permitted by the subdistrict. Figure 32-201(c) illustrates the dimensional requirements from Table 32-201(c) and Figure 32-201(d) provides a character example.

Figure 32-201(k)
Storefront Composition and Signage Examples

(6)  Arcade/colonnade. An arcade/colonnade is a covered, unglazed, linear hallway attached to the front of a building, supported by columns or pillars. The arcade/colonnade extends into the public right-of-way, over the sidewalk, creating a shaded environment ideal for pedestrians and conducive to retail. In arcades, upper stories of the building extend over the passageway. This frontage type is typically associated with retail and mixed-use buildings. 
a.  Arcade/colonnade dimensions . Table 32-201(g) provides the dimensional requirements and the maximum allowable encroachment. Figure 32-201(l) illustrates the dimensional requirements from Table 32-201(g) and Figure 32-201(m) provides a character example. 
1.  Arcades/colonnades shall extend over the sidewalk. A sidewalk should not run parallel to an arcade or colonnade, which allows pedestrians to bypass retail or commercial windows. Use of the arcade/colonnade requires entering into a right-of-way agreement between the property owner and the city. This agreement shall establish liability and insurance responsibilities in a form acceptable to the city.

In order to accommodate the required width of the pedestrian walkway, increasing the front setback beyond the minimum amount allowed by the subdistrict may be necessary and buildings shall set back further than the maximum allowed per subdistrict, if necessary. In the event the maximum front setback does not provide adequate space, the pedestrian walkway may be accommodated within the arcade/colonnade frontage type to meet the intent of the code. 
(2)  Where an existing public sidewalk adjoins the property line, the paved area of the public sidewalk and the pedestrian walkway shall connect, thereby expanding the perceived width of the public sidewalk. An existing, adjoining public sidewalk may be counted toward fulfilling the minimum clear width of a pedestrian walkway. 
(3)  All paving materials for the pedestrian walkway shall be compliant with ADA accessibility standards, and shall be constructed of concrete consistent with the adjacent sidewalk and acceptable to the development services and engineering departments. 
(4)  Where a sidewalk or a pedestrian walkway crosses vehicular ingress/egress points, the pedestrian crossing shall be paved with material consistent with the paving material of the sidewalk or walkway, and shall be clearly distinguished from the vehicular surface. 
(c)  Street trees. Street trees are intended to provide a shaded environment for the pedestrian, provide a physical separation between pedestrians and vehicles, and improve the overall visual appearance of the street. 
(1)  All new construction, relocation of a building, or addition equal to or greater than 20 percent of the gross floor area of an existing building shall install street trees at the time of development. Street trees shall be a canopy species, planted in the public right-of-way directly in front of the property line(s), uniformly spaced no greater than 25 feet on center. Spacing of trees may only exceed 25 feet in order to accommodate curb cuts, fire hydrants, utilities, existing trees, and other infrastructure elements. Palm varieties may be used at corners, crosswalks, or to accent building entrances and may be permitted in lieu of shade trees when physical conditions may prevent the proper growth of shade trees, as determined by the development services director. Consistency in street tree species shall be established on both sides of the street along a block face. The first to develop shall establish the species for the entire block. 
(2)  Street trees shall be planted in planting strips, landscaped planters or tree grates consistent with city street design standards. Street trees shall be located along the curb side, in order to separate pedestrians from vehicular lanes. 
(3)  All trees shall satisfy the following standards at the time of planting: 
(i)  Canopy species: Minimum 15 feet in height with a clear trunk space of six feet and a spread of no less than eight feet. 
(ii)  Palm trees: Minimum 20 feet in height, with a clear trunk space of eight feet. 
(4)  In the event that site constraints such as utility easements prevent the installation of required street trees, removable planters of small palms and small shrubs, vines or seasonal flowers shall be installed. In addition, the building shall provide devices such as awnings or roof overhangs to establish a shaded pedestrian environment. 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, § 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014) 
Sec. 32-202. - Civic open spaces. 
(a)  Civic open spaces. Civic open spaces are maintained outdoor spaces which are accessible by the general public, improve the pedestrian environment, are aesthetically pleasing, and serve as an amenity for the city as a whole as well as for occupants of the building which the open space serves. Civic open spaces are generally constructed by landowners during the development process. 
(1)  Amount. On sites 40,000 square feet or more in size, new buildings or additions of gross floor area equal to 20 percent or more to existing buildings, shall provide at least five percent of the size of the site, or portion of the site proposed for development in a multi-phased project, as civic open space(s). Dedicated rights-of-way may not count toward fulfilling the required amount. 
(2)  Types of civic open spaces. Civic open space shall be designed as one of the following types: 
a.  Green. A green is at least 2,000 square feet in size and adjoins streets on at least two sides or a pedestrian passageway and a street. Greens are designed primarily for passive uses, consisting primarily of lawn with either formally or informally arranged landscaping. 
b.  Plaza. A plaza is at least 2,000 square feet in size and adjoins a street on at least two sides or a pedestrian passageway and a street. Plazas are mostly hardscaped with formal landscaping and a water feature. 
c.  Playground. A playground shall be at least 2,500 square feet in size. Playgrounds shall provide children's play equipment and shaded seating. Playgrounds adjoin a street on at least one side and the proposed configuration should ensure easy surveillance of the area from the adjacent buildings and streets. 
d.  Square. A square is at least 10,000 square feet and adjoins streets on at least three sides. Squares may be up to 50 percent hardscaped, with formal landscaping. Squares accommodate both passive uses and community gatherings. 
e.  Attached green. The attached green is generally 3,000 to 6,000 square feet and spans the entire length of a block. Attached greens shall be at least 30 feet wide and are appropriate on the short end of a block. Attached greens are formally landscaped. 
Figure 32-202
Civic Open Spaces

(3)  Configuration. Civic open spaces shall be configured as follows: 
a.  The civic open space shall adjoin a street front property line for no less than 30 linear feet. 
b.  Except for attached greens, civic spaces shall have a proportion so that the depth is no more than two and one-half times the width, and the width is no more than five times the depth; 
c.  Civic open spaces shall be lined by building facades or streets on all sides. In order to provide oversight of the space, buildings facing civic open spaces shall contain habitable uses; parking lots, parking garages, and storage areas are not considered habitable uses. 
(4)  Additional standards. Civic open spaces shall meet the following minimum standards: 
a.  Civic open spaces must be accessible to the public during all daylight hours; 
b.  Civic open spaces must be situated to allow easy ingress and egress by pedestrians. Except for playgrounds, which may be fenced, no streetwalls, gates, fences or other impediments to pedestrian accessibility shall be permitted along the frontage line; 
c.  Civic open spaces must be located at the sidewalk level; 
d.  Civic open spaces must be open to the sky; however, open-air garden structures such as gazebos or trellises are permitted within civic open spaces; 
e.  Landscaping shall be arranged in a manner reflective of description of the type of civic open space. One shade tree per 20 feet of perimeter of the space is required. Trees may be arranged in regular spacing or in informal clusters, depending on the type of open space. Trees shall be installed to provide shade along walkways and for benches. Substituting shade trees for multiple palm species is not permitted; however, adding palms to the landscape design is permitted. 
f.  Each civic open space shall provide the following street furniture elements, specifications subject to approval by the City of Hallandale Beach: 
1.  One bench per 350 square feet of area; 
2.  One bicycle rack with no less than four spaces; 
3.  One trash receptacle; 
4.  One pet clean up station. 
g.  Fences are permitted only to enclose playgrounds or community gardens. Fences may be composed of wood or metal pickets and shall not exceed four feet in height. 
h.  Vehicular traffic shall not be permitted within a civic open space. 
i.  Civic open spaces shall be designed to enhance user safety and security using Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles by: 
1.  Being well lighted; 
2.  Having one or more focal points within the open space visible from all adjoining buildings and streets; and 
3.  Having a clear landscape zone between three feet and eight feet in height providing sightlines unobstructed by berms or bushes. 
(5)  Availability. Civic open space shall be developed and ready for use concurrent with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building(s) for which the open space is required. 
(6)  Public benefit height option. In order to encourage projects to provide civic open space in the Central RAC, increased building height and density may be approved in the RAC Corridor and Transit Core subdistricts, provided additional criteria is met, including providing a total of seven and one-half percent of the site, or the portion of the site proposed for development in a multi-phased project, as civic open space(s). 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, § 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014) 
Sec. 32-203. - Central RAC parking standards. 
(a)  Purpose of revised standards. This section provides modified regulations for off-street parking and bicycle parking within the Central RAC zoning district. These regulations recognize that the RAC is an interconnected area with multimodal transportation options, and that improper placement of parking and mandatory duplication of the parking supply on each building site separates the various land uses from each other. This separation reduces the viability of the mixed-use districts and harms the walkability of the streets in the RAC. These regulations reflect the needs of an urban, mixed use area. When in conflict with the regulations in division 11, this section shall rule. 
(b)  Minimum number of off-street parking spaces. The minimum number of parking spaces required in section 32-455 "Minimum parking space requirements" is modified by this section for the Central RAC zoning district. 
(1)  Table 32-203(a) identifies the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for the use; uses not listed shall provide parking in accordance with the amount required in section 32-455. 
Table 32-203(a)
Minimum Number of Off-street Parking Spaces Required per Use Single-family Residential (attached or detached) Single-family House, Townhouse, or Duplex 2 spaces per unit Live/Work and Work/Live Units 2 spaces per unit Multi-family Residential Use Efficiency dwelling unit 1.0 space/unit One bedroom dwelling unit 1.25 spaces/unit Two or more bedroom dwelling unit 1.75 spaces per unit Guest parking cumulatively: First 20 Units 0.5 spaces/unit Units 21-50 0.3 spaces/unit Units 51+ 0.2 spaces/unit Lodging Hotels/Motels 1.0 space for each guest room plus 
1.0 space per 300 sq. ft. of ballrooms, meeting rooms, shops, restaurants, and lounges Business Uses Professional Office 1 space per 300 sf. of net floor area Retail, Restaurant, and other Commercial Uses 1 space per 300 sf. of gross floor area  
(2)  Once service commences on the Tri-Rail Coastal Link and the Hallandale Beach station is operational, the minimum number of off-street parking required may be multiplied by a factor of .70 for properties located within one-quarter mile of the station, measured along the closest pedestrian route between nearest building entrance and nearest station entrance. 
(3)  Properties located with the Fashion/Art/Design subdistrict are not required to provide additional parking resulting from a change of use or renovations of a building and any existing nonconforming parking layout is permitted to maintain the existing layout. 
(4)  Properties located within 750 feet of the Planned Tri-Rail Coastal Link station (see regulating plan) are not required to provide additional parking resulting from a change in use within an existing building. 
(c)  Location and access to off-street parking. Parking and service areas shall be accessed and located at the rear or side of the building(s) whenever possible. 
(1)  Location. 
a.  Except for houses and duplexes that do not have a rear alley, parking is not permitted in front setbacks or in side setbacks facing streets, parks, or civic open spaces. 
b.  On primary streets all parking lots shall be located to the rear of buildings. If parking in the rear is inappropriate or impossible and a RAM is requested, the city commission may require special perimeter landscape treatments to protect and improve the pedestrian experience along the street. 
c.  On secondary streets, parking lots may be located on the side of buildings provided the parking is screened from view of the street by a streetwall (see section 32-194(d)(6)). 
d.  Parking garage design standards. 
1.  On primary streets, parking garage levels shall be fully concealed from view by a story containing active use, such as residential, office, or retail for at least 20 feet of depth. 
2.  On secondary streets, parking garage levels not lined by another use shall be screened by a building facade that meets the architectural requirements in section 32-194(d). 
Figure 32-203(a)
Parking Garage Design Standards

(2)  Access. 
a.  Except for houses and duplexes that do not have rear alleys, and properties located within the Fashion/Art/Design subdistrict, parking shall not be accessed by backing onto public streets. 
b.  Access drives shall not exceed 24 feet in width. 
c.  On primary streets, alleys or secondary streets shall be the primary source of vehicular access to off-street parking, except that access to parking in the Fashion/Arts/Design subdistrict is not permitted from NE 2nd Avenue for properties south of NW 3rd Street. 
d.  When neither alleys nor secondary streets are present, primary vehicular access may be from a primary street. In the instance that site constraints necessitate access from a primary street, and the provision of an access drive precludes meeting the minimum building frontage percentage required, the development services director may administratively allow a reduction from the minimum building frontage in order to allow vehicular access to the site. 
e.  Alleys may be incorporated into parking lots and garages as standard drive aisles and vehicles may back out onto alleys. Access to all properties adjacent to the alley shall be maintained. 
f.  When an alley is not present, vehicular access between adjacent parcels across property lines is required, and shall be accommodated within the site layout. The first property owner to develop shall be required to make an irrevocable offer of cross-access to the adjacent parcels prior to issuance of a development order. When adjacent property develops, a reciprocal cross-access agreement is required, and the physical connection shall be completed by both property owners. 
g.  Parking lots and structures shall provide pedestrian access directly from a street. In addition, pedestrian access may also be provided directly from a building. 
h.  Buildings with more than 250 feet of street frontage on a block face shall provide a pedestrian passageway at least ten feet wide connecting the rear parking to the sidewalk in the public right-of-way that the building faces. 
i.  Public sidewalks may not be interrupted or deviated to accommodate back out parking, drop-off or valet parking. The sidewalk shall continue across driveway openings. 
j.  Parking lots with no more than 20 spaces and a maximum of ten spaces per corridor are exempt from the requirements of section 32-453(i)(4) requiring vehicular entry/exit in one continuous forward motion. 
(d)  Bicycle parking and facilities . Bicycle parking and facilities shall be provided within the RAC Corridor and Transit Core subdistricts. 
(1)  Minimum number of bicycle parking spaces. Bicycle parking shall be provided at one space per every 20 vehicular parking spaces. 
(2)  Design and location. Visitor, employee and resident bicycle parking facilities shall be provided in a location(s) shown on the site plan that meets the following standards; 
a.  Provided in a safe, accessible and convenient location; 
b.  Accessed within 300 feet of the main building entrance; and 
c.  Does not encroach into the minimum pedestrian walkway (see section 32-201(b)). 
d.  The planning and zoning director shall review the location, design, and details of the bicycle spaces as part of the site plan review. 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, § 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014) 
Sec. 32-204. - Street and block standards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The highly connected street and block structure of the Central RAC is a critical component to foster multi-modal options. Smaller block sizes reduce bike and walk distances and allow traffic to disperse using multiple routes. The standards that guide the creation of new blocks and changes to existing streets and blocks are contained in this section. 
(b)  Block standards. The following dimensional standards promote a desirable block structure: 
(1)  The maximum block length should not exceed 660 feet. 
(2)  The maximum perimeter of a block generally should not exceed 1,800 feet, as measured along the inner edges of each street right-of-way. Block perimeters may exceed 1,800 feet, up to a maximum of 2,000 feet if one or more of the following conditions apply: 
a.  The block has at least one face on an arterial street that limits access points. 
b.  The block contains a public parking garage. 
(3)  The portion of a block between intersecting streets may not exceed 600 feet without providing either: 
a.  A publicly dedicated pedestrian passageway not less than ten feet in width that provides access to another street; or, 
b.  An alley at least 20 feet in width that provides vehicular access to another street. 
(c)  Existing streets. In the case of existing streets, the city will not abandon, relocate, or close streets if the block size(s) will exceed the standards in 32-204(b). 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, § 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014) 
Sec. 32-205. - Approval processes. 
(a)  Approval types. Development applications may follow two different review and approval processes: 
(1)  Development applications in the Central RAC zoning district may be approved administratively if the application: 
a.  Meets all requirements of this Code; and 
b.  Does not exceed the base density specified for its RAC subdistrict; and 
c.  Does not require any conditional uses, variances, or redevelopment area modifications. 
(2)  Development applications in the Central RAC zoning district may be approved only by the city commission using the major development review process if the application: 
a.  Meets all requirements of this Code only upon approval of simultaneously requested conditional uses, variances, or redevelopment area modifications; and/or 
b.  Is requesting a density level between the base density and the maximum density allowable in any Central RAC subdistrict. 
(b)  Submission requirements and procedures. 
(1)  Development applications in the Central RAC zoning district that may be approved administratively (see subsection (a)(1) above) shall be submitted to the city using the procedures in article V of this Code, except that the development services director has the authority to approve the application administratively even if chapter V would otherwise require review and approval by the planning and zoning board and the city commission. 
(2)  Development applications in the Central RAC zoning district that may be approved only by the city commission (see subsection (a)(2) above) shall be submitted to the city using the procedures in article V of this Code. These applications will be reviewed and processed as if they were major developments even if they are below the size thresholds in section 32-782(a), applicability. 
(c)  Conditional uses and variances. The city commission may approve conditional uses and variances in the Central RAC zoning district using the procedures and standards in article VIII of this Code plus any additional standards set forth in the Central RAC regulations. However: 
(1)  These processes cannot be used to increase the number of stories above the maximum building height established for each Central RAC subdistrict. 
(2)  These processes cannot be used to increase density levels above the base density in any Central RAC subdistrict; the process for requesting a density increase (up to the maximum density) is set forth in section 32-206. 
(d)  Redevelopment area modifications. The city commission may approve redevelopment area modifications in the Central RAC zoning district using the procedures and standards in section 32-135, redevelopment area modifications, plus the following additional standards: 
(1)  This process cannot be used to increase the number of stories above the maximum building height established for each Central RAC subdistrict. 
(2)  This process cannot be used to increase density levels above the base density in any Central RAC subdistrict; the process for requesting a density increase (up to the maximum density) is set forth in section 32-206. 
(e)  General rules for changes to Central RAC zoning district. 
(1)  Overlays as contained within section 32-186. 
a.  Prior mapped overlays. Portions of the Central RAC zoning district had previously been included in one or more mapped overlays: North Dixie Corridor overlay, South Dixie Highway overlay, fashion art and design overlay, Pembroke Road overlay, Foster Road Corridor overlay, and redevelopment overlay. Relevant parts of those overlay regulations have been incorporated into the Central RAC subdistrict regulations. 
b.  Previously approved planned development overlays. Some individual properties in the Central RAC zoning district had obtained prior approval for a site-specific "planned development district (PDD)" overlay. At the landowner's discretion: 
1.  The terms of those approvals may continue to be used to obtain remaining development approvals until such time as the original approval and/or development agreement has expired; or 
2.  The provisions of the Central RAC zoning district may be used to obtain future development approvals without rescinding the prior "planned development" approval. However, the two methods may not be combined except to the extent that non-conformity with the current code is not furthered. 
c.  Future overlays. Additional mapped or planned development overlays may be approved in the Central RAC zoning district subject to the following restrictions: 
1.  On sites in the RAC corridor subdistrict with five or more contiguous acres under unified control, a landowner may request a planned development overlay (PDO) and development agreement consistent with the applicable provisions of section 32-186; on sites in the greyhound track subdistrict with five or more contiguous acres in lot area under unified control, a landowner may request a planned development overlay (PDO) and development agreement consistent with the applicable provisions of section 32-186. 
2.  On sites in the RAC corridor subdistrict with three to five contiguous acres under unified control, a landowner may request a planned development overlay (PDO) and development agreement consistent with the applicable provisions of section 32-186 for a period up to six months after the land was rezoned to the Central RAC zoning district. 
i.  The request must accompany an official development application that meets the site plan review submission requirements as set forth in article V of the City of Hallandale Beach Zoning and Land Development Code. 
ii.  Development approval for the application must be obtained within six months of the original request for PDO and development agreement. For good cause shown, the city manager may grant an additional six months for the development plan approval. 
iii.  Development approvals granted under this provision are subject to extension provisions as outlined in section 32-790 of the City of Hallandale Beach Zoning and Land Development Code. 
iv.  Should the site plan approval expire, the development agreement shall expire concurrently, and the PDO will be administratively removed via rezoning. 
3.  All sites within a planned development overlay shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
i.  Development must be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. 
ii.  Allowable uses and all development regulations and requirements, including height and density shall be as specified for the RAC corridor subdistrict, except where modifications were specifically requested and explicitly approved in the planned development overlay and development agreement. 
iii.  Allowable uses and all development regulations and requirements, including height and density shall be as specified for the underlying subdistrict, except where modifications are specifically requested and explicitly approved in a planned development overlay and development agreement. 
iv.  Such modifications specifically requested and specifically approved in a planned development overlay and development agreement shall not be required to demonstrate compliance with the development regulations applicable for the underlying subdistrict. 
(2)  Expansions, contractions, and subdistrict adjustments. The boundary of the Central RAC zoning district and the boundaries of its subdistricts may be expanded or contracted by the city commission by amending the regulating plan in section 32-192. Landowners desiring boundary changes to the regulating plan must request an amendment to the zoning and land development code instead of using the rezoning process. Requests for amendments to the regulating plan shall be advertised, posted and noticed in conformity with the requirements of section 32-1004 as to rezonings in addition to requirements for zoning code text amendments. 
(f)  Transitional period. For applications submitted prior to September 1, 2014, staff may present an analysis of the measurable parameters of development under both regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2014-31, §§ 22, 24(Exh. B), 11-5-2014; Ord. No. 2016-20, § 1, 10-19-2016) 
Sec. 32-206. - RAC density allocation standards. 
(a)  Base density and maximum density. Each Central RAC subdistrict defines a base density and a maximum density, expressed as the number of dwelling units allowed per acre. 
(1)  Development up to the base density is permitted by right. 
(2)  Development between the base density and the maximum density requires a RAC density allocation as described in subsection (c). 
(3)  Development above the maximum density cannot be approved. 
(b)  Regional activity center (RAC). The Hallandale Beach Comprehensive Plan establishes a Regional Activity Center (RAC) for an area generally bounded by Pembroke Road to the north, Federal Highway to the east, County Line Road to the south, Dixie Highway and westward along the Foster Road Corridor to the west. The purpose of the RAC is to define an area of regional significance within which transit-oriented and mixed-use development are encouraged, public transportation will be enhanced, the need for automobile travel will be reduced, redevelopment is encouraged, the walkable urban form is being enhanced, development/redevelopment proposals are encouraged in areas adjacent to major transportation corridors, and existing residential areas are protected. 
(c)  RAC density allocation. The Hallandale Beach Comprehensive Plan and the Broward County Land Use Plan limit the total number of dwelling units within the RAC. The city commission has established the following density allocation procedures to ensure the equitable allocation of the remaining dwelling units in accordance with both plans. 
(1)  These procedures must be followed for development applications that would exceed the base density in a Central RAC subdistrict. Individual subdistricts provide performance criteria that must also be met to qualify for density levels above the specified base density. 
(2)  These procedures must also be followed for RAC development applications outside the Central RAC zoning district where additional density is allowed by the zoning district or through rezoning to a district that allows a higher density. 
(3)  Additional dwelling units will be allocated at the time of development plan approval by the city commission. Upon expiration of a development plan, as provided in section 32-790, the allocation of dwelling units shall terminate and such units shall be made available for future development. 
(4)  The allocation of additional dwelling units shall be subject to all provisions of the zoning and land development code applicable at the time of development plan approval and subject to any special conditions imposed by the city commission on a development approval. 
(5)  The Broward County Land Use Plan limits the total number of dwelling units that can be added within the RAC east of U.S. 1. Allocation of dwelling units east of U.S. 1 must be consistent with that plan. 
(6)  Acreage for non-residential land use shall be assigned on a net acreage basis to all lands included in the parcel needed to comply with the on-site land development requirements, such as building footprint, setbacks, parking, outdoor pedestrian circulation, landscaping, drainage, and other improvements. 
(d)  Monitoring of development activity. Hallandale Beach has entered into an interlocal agreement with Broward County that commits the city to monitor development activity with the RAC and to submit quarterly reports to the county about the density and intensity of land uses within the RAC. 
(1)  Within mixed use projects, RAC acreage and RAC dwelling units shall be assigned according to the proportion of floor area associated with each use for monitoring overall RAC build out (e.g., if 50 percent of the floor area is used for A, then 50 percent of the net acreage of the development parcel shall be assigned to A). 
(e)  Future increases in RAC density. If the Hallandale Beach Comprehensive Plan and the Broward County Land Use Plan are amended to increase the total number of dwelling units allowable within the RAC, this code may be amended to define how the additional dwelling units will be allocated.

6.  Plans for all rooftop or building-mounted antennas shall be submitted with each application for a building permit and shall include a site plan drawn at a scale of not less than one inch equals 20 feet, indicating the diameter, screening, location, setbacks from edges of building for any existing and proposed tower or antenna and the height above the roof, proposed screening, and any other criteria deemed necessary by the city manager. A mounting detail drawn at a scale no smaller than one-half inch equals one foot shall also be provided. 
d.  Communication towers, freestanding. 
1.  Siting preferences. To minimize adverse visual impacts on residential or nonresidential properties, the city will encourage the location of communication tower sites on public property consistent with the intent of the congressional legislation on this subject. Accordingly, the city shall consider when evaluating whether to approve a communication tower application whether there is suitable public property near the proposed site which would physically accommodate the communication tower without unreasonably compromising the antenna tower's signal reception or transmitting capability or unreasonably compromising the communication system capability. 
Towers on public property shall be located based upon the following hierarchy of zoning districts: 
i.  OS-Open space district. 
ii.  CF-Community facility district (conditional use required). 
If it is not feasible to locate the communication tower on public property or if a private site is preferred, the applicant shall demonstrate the reasons for the preference. The city may require opinions from suitable engineers or other learned professionals or experts when evaluating siting preferences and may defer considering applications for up to 30 days to permit for analysis of the proposal. 
2.  Shared use. Towers in combination with existing utility poles may be permitted as an accessory use on land designated utilities on the city's land use plan and zoned CF zoning district. Such towers shall be constructed as part of the existing utility poles or as replacements for the existing utility poles. No communication tower constructed exclusively for personal wireless services shall be permitted. 
3.  Conditional use on nonpublic property. If a communication tower cannot be located on public property, such towers shall be permitted as follows: 
i.  Monopoles are permitted as a conditional use in B-I, CR-A, CR-P, CF, ED and I-L districts. 
ii.  Guyed wire and lattice transmission towers are permitted as a conditional use in I-L and CF districts. 
4.  Application; required information. Every application for a communication tower shall include a statement prepared by a licensed professional engineer, which describes the tower height and design and includes a cross section of the structure showing the tower's compliance with applicable standards as set forth in the South Florida Building Code, latest Broward County Edition; and describes the tower's capacity, including the number and type of antennas it can accommodate. No tower shall be permitted to exceed its loading capacity. For all towers attached to existing structures, the statement shall include certification that the structure can support the load superimposed from the tower. All towers shall have the capacity to permit multiple users; at a minimum, monopole towers shall be able to accommodate two users, and at a minimum, self-support/lattice or guyed towers shall be able to accommodate three users. 
5.  Height/setbacks and related location requirements. 
i.  Communication towers as set forth in this section shall be located on sites containing a principal use on the same property which meets the minimum lot size requirement for the zoning district in which it is located. 
ii.  The height of a communications tower shall not exceed 150 feet. Tower height shall be measured from the crown of the road of the nearest public street. 
iii.  Communication towers shall comply with the minimum setback and distance requirements provided in table I [sic].

iii.  The warning signs may be attached to freestanding poles if the content of the signs may be obstructed by landscaping. 
19.  City commission action; review criteria. In approving applications for the installation of amateur radio antennas or conditional use for freestanding communication towers or antennas, the city may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the provisions of conditional use criteria of article VIII of this chapter. Violations of the specified conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under which the antenna is approved, shall be deemed grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit. 
In addition to the review criteria for conditional use of section 32-964, the city commission shall evaluate applications for communication towers based upon the following standards: 
i.  Whether the proposed antenna or tower minimizes adverse visual impacts. 
ii.  Whether the proposed antenna or tower has been designed to blend with the surrounding environment, which may include camouflaging the antenna or tower such as a light pole or tree. 
20.  Shared use of communication antennas. 
i.  To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of communication towers, collocation of communication antennas by more than one provider on existing or new communication towers, or existing suitable structures such as water towers or athletic lighting shall be required and take precedence over the construction of new single-use communication towers. Accordingly, each application for a communication tower shall include a written evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a communication tower, or other suitable structures if available. The evaluation shall analyze, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
(i) Structural capacity of the tower or towers. 
(ii) Radio frequency interference. 
(iii) Geographic service area requirements. 
(iv) Mechanical or electrical incompatibility. 
(v) Inability or ability to locate equipment on the tower or towers. 
(vi) Availability of towers for collocation. 
(vii) The tower has been designed for sharing. 
(viii) Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications Commission that would preclude the shared use of the tower. 
(ix) The tower owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the facility to others on fair and reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms. 
(x) Additional information requested by the city. 
(xi) The provisions of section 32-925 shall not apply for purposes of erecting antennas on nonconforming communication towers. 
ii.  The facility owner shall provide documentation acceptable to the city, agreeing to offer space on fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms, at fair market value, and to negotiate leases promptly with other nonaffiliated entities without undue delay. 
iii.  The city commission may waive the maximum number of towers listed in subsection (b)(1)d.5.v. of this section and the maximum number of antennas listed in subsection (b)(1)d.6. of this section, provided that the applicant demonstrates that the additional towers or antennas will not adversely impact the structural integrity, aesthetic or land use compatibility of the existing tower. The city may deny an application if an available collocation site is feasible and the application is not for collocation. 
iv.  A communication tower that is determined to be inappropriate for sharing shall be assumed to be inappropriate for sharing the same types of facilities in the future. Such towers will not need to be evaluated in the future regarding sharing with the same type of facility for which it has been determined to be inappropriate. The city shall retain a list of such towers and will provide a copy of the list to all potential applicants. The city may require additional sharing feasibility evaluations if warranted by changes in technology. 
v.  For any communication tower approved for shared use, the owner of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the communication tower and the tower's load capacity to all other providers. 
e.  Applications. 
1.  The city shall act promptly on any application submitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. The reasons for rejecting any application filed under these provisions shall be explained, set forth in writing and based on substantial evidence. 
2.  The issuance of a permit, however, is not a lease; and no municipally owned property may be used without a lease agreement with the city. The city may, as appropriate, to protect its property and the public interest, establish additional requirements beyond the minimum requirements of a permit for municipally owned property. This provision further does not preclude the city from issuing a letter of interest for the purposes of leasing sites on designated city property for the construction and installation of personal wireless service facilities. For designated parks, the city will encourage the installation of facilities which have a minimum impact on the surrounding areas and are consistent with the development of the park. 
f.  Inspections. 
1.  The city may require, at the tower owner's expense, periodic inspections of new and existing installations of communication towers and antennas, including satellite dish antennas used for commercial purposes, in order to ensure structural and electrical integrity. 
2.  The owner of new and existing towers, antennas and communication installations shall pay an annual renewal/inspection fee as established in the fee booklet. The building official shall conduct the annual inspection of the structures and installations. The applicant, at his expense, may provide certification by a state licensed engineer as to the structural integrity of the towers, antennas and associated communication installations which satisfies the annual inspection requirement. The building official shall require repair or removal as deemed necessary.

DIVISION 8. - LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 32-381. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this division are as follows: 
(1)  To establish minimum standards for the installation and maintenance of functional and sustainable landscaped areas within the city, that increases the storage of sequestered carbon, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
(2)  To emphasize the importance of preserving and replenishing the natural environment and maintaining an ecological balance for the residents of the city. Excessive land coverage by structures and paving tends to significantly increase ambient air temperatures, a problem especially noticeable in subtropical climates. The presence of trees, plants and other types of vegetation has the opposite effect through transpiration and the creation of protective shade. Impervious nonlandscaped surfaces also generate greater water runoff, causing problems from erosion, flooding, water pollution, and interfere with recharge of the aquifer. 
(3)  To promote the use of landscape elements which effectively contribute to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, water absorption, and noise, glare and heat abatement. 
(4)  To promote Florida-Friendly landscaping principles through the use of drought-tolerant plant species, grouping of plant materials by water requirements, the use of irrigation systems that conserve the use of water and reduction of the amount of lawn area. Florida-Friendly landscape principles also promote planting the right plant in the right place. 
(5)  To promote the establishments of functional and sustainable landscapes that increase the storage of sequestered carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
(6)  To protect and enhance the aesthetic character of Hallandale Beach. 
(7)  To provide the physical benefits of using plant material as a function of sustainability and integral part of the City of Hallandale Beach urban development. 
(8)  To provide minimum standards for landscaping new developments or for redevelopment. 
(9)  To use landscape material, especially street trees, to visually define the hierarchy of roadways, and to provide shade and a visual edge along roadways.

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Cross reference- Traffic and motor vehicles, and boats, ch. 28. 

Sec. 32-451. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this division to establish minimum requirements for off-street parking and loading facilities allocated for both public and private usage and providing minimum design requirements for such facilities. The ever-increasing number of vehicles generated from and attracted to residential, business, industrial and public activities mandate that adequate parking and loading facilities, which permit safe and efficient vehicle and pedestrian movement, be provided in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. XI, § 1) 
Sec. 32-452. - Off-street parking requirements. 
(a)  General requirements. 
(1)  Every use or structure instituted, constructed, erected or structurally altered shall provide off-street parking facilities for the use of occupants, employees, visitors or patrons. The provision of off-street parking spaces in conjunction with all land or building uses shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and such parking facilities shall be maintained as long as the use is continued. 
(2)  No owner or operator of any structure or use shall discontinue, dispense with, or cause a discontinuance or reduction in required vehicular parking facilities required by the applicable code provisions existing at the time of construction, use or occupancy without establishing alternate parking facilities which meet the requirements of this division. A substitution of remote spaces for existing on-site spaces shall not be permitted. 
(3)  Parking facilities shall be maintained in a good state of repair and operation, based on commonly accepted engineering and construction standards, and the intent of this division. The owner, lessee and person in control of the property shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance. The facilities required to be maintained shall include, without being limited to, paved or other hard-surfaced space or driveway areas, pavement markings, traffic control devices, wheel stops, illumination (as specified in section 32-453(e)), walls, fences or landscape areas. 
(4)  Except as otherwise provided in every district zoned B-O, B-L, B-G, B-I and I-L, all required off-street parking shall be unreserved and unrestricted. Where a building or premises contains two or more separate permitted commercial uses, and joint parking is provided for those uses, the reservation or assignment of any required off-street parking spaces for use by or for a specific commercial establishment located within that building or premises is not permitted. This provision shall not prohibit designation of handicapped or emergency parking, nor prohibit the reservation of certain spaces for usage by certain of those commercial establishments on a limited time period basis, where the director approves based on his finding that frequent vehicle turnover at those locations is a business necessity and will not impair the ability of the entire parking facility to provide service to all the permitted uses served by the joint parking. 
(b)  Joint and shared usage. 
(1)  Joint usage. Two or more structures or uses may collectively provide their required off-street parking, provided that the total number of parking spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses if computed separately. 
(2)  Shared usage. Required parking spaces may be permitted by the director to be utilized for meeting the parking requirements of two separate permitted uses when it is clearly established by the applicant that these two uses will primarily utilize these spaces at different times of the day, week, month or year, such as a church sharing spaces with a retail store. Recordable covenants, with correct legal descriptions, shall be submitted by the owners of the property and the businesses, in form acceptable to the city attorney; and these covenants shall be recorded by the city at the applicant's expense, and shall run with the land. These covenants shall provide that the use, or portion of a use, that requires the shared parking in order to obtain the necessary permits or licenses shall cease and terminate upon any change in their respective schedules of operation that results in conflicting or overlapping usage of the parking facilities; and no nonresidential use may be made of that portion of the property until the required parking facilities are available and provided. The covenant shall also provide that the city may collect attorney fees if litigation is necessary. 
(c)  Restrictions. The storage, sale or repair of merchandise or vehicles of the display of signs or advertising devices on vehicles, structures or land is not permitted in off-street parking areas. This provision shall not prohibit persons from parking vehicles in such areas that contain information, such as company name, certificate of competency number, etc., that are required by any applicable laws, ordinances or regulations if such information is provided only to the extent and in the manner required by such laws, ordinances or regulations. 
(d)  Location of parking. 
(1)  Required parking for all residential uses shall be located on the same parcel of property that it is intended to serve. 
(2)  Required parking for all new nonresidential uses shall be located on the same parcel of property that it is intended to serve. 
(3)  Existing nonresidential uses which need to add spaces to accommodate current requirements or proposed expansion may provide for such additional parking on a remote separate parcel zoned for parking as provided in article III. No remote parking facilities, however, shall be located more than 450 feet by legal pedestrian route from the use or structure they are intended to serve and shall be accessible to the use being served without the necessity of a user of that facility crossing an arterial street, railroad track, or waterway. Such distance shall be measured from the nearest actual remote parking space to the nearest entrance of the structure of the use being served. All lots used for remote parking purposes shall be joined with the lot on which the principal use is located by a lease arrangement of not less than ten years or unity of title declaration, either of which shall be approved by the city attorney. Those parties having any right, title or interest in and to the property being served by the remote parking shall execute and place on the public record of the county, at their expense, a covenant, approved by the city commission, that the nonresidential use, or portion of it, that requires the remote parking in order to obtain the necessary permits or licenses shall cease and terminate upon the loss and elimination of the remote parking, that no nonresidential use may be made of the portion of the property requiring remote parking until the required parking facilities are available and provided. This covenant shall run with the land and be binding on the heirs, successors, assigns and lessees, and shall contain a provision that the city may collect attorney's fee if litigation is necessary to enforce this covenant. If any legally existing use, as of the effective date of this division, is changed to a use requiring additional parking spaces, remote parking provisions shall not apply. 
(e)  Driveway usage. On-site driveways for single-family detached, townhouses where parking spaces directly abut the units and two-family dwellings in residential districts shall be considered as off-street parking spaces provided sufficient space is available on such driveways to meet the requirements of this division. 
(f)  Nonconformance. 
(1)  All property with existing developments on the effective date of this division which is not in compliance with the provisions of this division shall be required to conform to this division and secure from the appropriate city department a certificate certifying compliance with the requirements of this division. Places of worship and related accessory uses with nonconforming parking existing on December 1, 1998, shall not be required to conform to this division except when structural additions greater than 30 percent of the entire floor area are made. 
(2)  In order to comply with the requirement that all property with existing development on the effective date of this division comply with the full requirements of this division within the established deadline, a property owner shall be required to construct, operate and maintain sufficient parking spaces, loading areas and other facilities in compliance with the standards of this division, subject to the following limitations: 
a.  Construction of a parking garage or upper level or above grade open air parking garage shall not be required. 
b.  A property owner is only required to utilize land area that is part of the same premises to be served and is not required to utilize adjoining or acquire noncontiguous property. For purposes of this division, the same premises shall mean the parcel of land occupied by the use being served and the accessory buildings or uses customarily incident to it, including, without being limited to, open space areas and areas used for nonconforming parking areas, such as unpaved lots. 
c.  Except for new construction, reconstruction or structural additions, property owners shall not be in violation of this division for failure to provide the additional parking spaces required by this division if, in the opinion of the city engineer, based on commonly accepted architectural and engineering standards applicable to construction of off-street parking areas, he has constructed, in compliance with this division, as many additional parking spaces, loading areas and other facilities as the physical capacity of the premises will allow. The measurement of the parking and loading capacity area shall not include areas occupied by or blocked from access by a wall or roof structure. 
d.  When in the opinion of the city engineer, there is sufficient swale area to accommodate on-street parking in the public right-of-way, the parking required for residentially zoned properties may be provided in the right-of-way and considered in compliance with this section. The city engineer shall check and approve a plan showing such improvement so as to provide proper drainage and design. 
Building permit for parking improvements in the public right-of-way is subject to the provisions of [sub]section 25-37(c) should such improvement need to be altered or removed by the city at any time.

New parking facilities, and any that are replaced, reconstructed, upgraded or otherwise the subject of a building permit shall comply with the then-current edition of the IES Lighting Handbook. 
(4)  All site development plans shall include a parking facility lighting plan. That plan shall be certified by a registered architect or registered engineer as providing illumination in accordance with the applicable minimum standards set forth in this subsection. Subsequent construction must comply with that lighting plan. If there exists a question concerning whether the work was done in accordance with specifications, the director may require as a prerequisite to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy that the architect or engineer who prepared the plans certify that all work was done in accordance with specifications. 
(5)  a.  All required illumination shall be controlled by automatic devices. 
b.  For business uses with open or enclosed parking facilities, the required illumination shall be provided at least 30 minutes after the closing time of any establishment served by the parking facility. 
c.  Any parking facility that serves a residential use must maintain the minimum levels of illumination established by this subsection through the use of natural or artificial light 24 hours per day. 
(6)  All lighting shall be shaded or screened and positioned in such a manner as to minimize offensiveness to any neighboring property. 
(7)  All property owners and lessees shall be responsible for the replacement or repair of any light that becomes nonfunctional and reduces the illumination below the required standard.

Sec. 32-456. - Off-street loading requirements. 
(a)  General regulations. 
(1)  At the time of the erection of any principal or accessory use or at the time any principal or accessory use is altered, enlarged or increased in capacity by adding floor area, there shall be space provided and maintained for the loading and unloading of materials, goods or supplies, and for delivery and shipping so that vehicles for these services may use this space without encroaching on or interfering with the public use of streets, parking facilities and alleys by pedestrians and other vehicles. 
(2)  No owner or operator of any structure or use shall discontinue, dispense with, or cause a discontinuance or reduction in required loading facilities required in this section and existing at the time of construction, use or occupancy without establishing alternate loading facilities which meet the requirements of this division. 
(3)  When any use or structure is modernized, altered or enlarged with a resultant increase in floor area, additional off-street loading spaces that may be required shall be provided; and a revised site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. 
(b)  Space dimensions. 
(1)  An off-street loading space shall include an area at least 12 feet wide by 50 feet long with 141/2 feet vertical clearance. Each off-street loading space shall be easily accessible and arranged for convenient and safe ingress and egress by motor truck or trailer combination. 
(2)  When two or more loading spaces are provided, the director may require a 60-foot maneuvering apron, if necessary, as shown in the following illustration: 

(c)  Joint usage. Combined or joint off-street loading spaces for two or more uses may be collectively provided if off-street loading facilities are equal in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several uses and are so located and arranged as to be usable by all. 
(d)  Drainage and maintenance. Proposed grading and drainage for off-street loading facilities shall be approved by the director. All loading areas shall be paved with a minimum of six inches' shellrock or limerock base and a one-inch hotplant mix asphaltic, concrete or other acceptable base and/or durable weatherproof surface pavement. Loading areas shall be maintained in a manner as to not create a hazard or nuisance. 
(e)  Restrictions. No areas supplied to meet required off-street parking facilities shall be utilized for or deemed to meet the requirements for off-street loading facilities. 
(f)  Mixed uses. 
(1)  Provision may be made for combined off-street loading spaces to serve a mixed-use multiple story building; however, the allowance of combined off-street loading spaces for mixed uses within a building shall apply only to buildings in excess of one story in height which are designed and constructed in such a manner as to allow interior access of all uses within the building to the combined loading spaces. 
(2)  In a mixed-use single-story building, each use in excess of 6,000 gross square feet shall have adjacent to the use its required off-street loading space. The city manager may make reasonable requirements for the location of off-street loading areas when the director determines full adherence would impose an unreasonable hardship on the use of the property. A paved loading zone, 12 feet in width, parallel to the building, without a maneuvering apron, is required provided the design does not hinder the free movement of vehicles and pedestrians and avoids undue interference with public use of the streets, alleys or parking areas. This provision shall not be construed to require more off-street loading spaces than required in section 32-457, but only to require that each use in a mixed-use single-story building have direct access and be in close proximity to at least one off-street loading space.

DIVISION 17. - SIGNS 

Sec. 32-601. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to: 
(1)  Promote the proper placement and maintenance of signs within the various zoning districts of the city; 
(2)  Promote traffic and pedestrian safety and aesthetics; 
(3)  Recognize the identification and communication needs or uses and establishments of various sizes; 
(4)  Encourage creative and innovational design techniques; and 
(5)  Establish procedures that insist upon equal treatment of all parties involved by regulation of the posting, displaying, erection, use and maintenance of signs. 
(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code to the contrary, any sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this Code or otherwise lawfully existing with a commercial message may, at the option of the owner, contain a noncommercial message in lieu of a commercial message. The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the owner of the sign provided that the sign is not a prohibited sign or sign type and provided that the size, height, setback, and other dimensional criteria contained in this Code have been met. 
(b)  This division shall regulate all aspects of signage, except building design, official directional signs and traffic signs; design of signs; signs within buildings and not externally visible, window displays; point of purchase advertising displays, such as newspaper dispensers and candy machines; and historical site plaques. 
(c)  This division shall not apply to any sign placed, erected or maintained at any place in the city pursuant to or as permitted or required by any contract entered into by the city with any person. In the case of any sign contract entered into by the city, aside from lewd, indecent or obscene advertisements, no restriction on the content of advertisements shall be placed by the city. However, a sign owner who contracts with the city may in his sole discretion limit the type or content of advertising to be placed on his sign. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. XII, § 1; Ord. No. 2005-15, § 1, 10-3-2005; Ord. No. 2016-13, § 1, 6-15-2016) 
Sec. 32-602. - Short title. 
    This division may be known and shall be cited as the "Sign Code of the City of Hallandale Beach, Florida." 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. XII, § 2) 
Sec. 32-603. - Severability. 
(a)  Interpretation; substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech. Notwithstanding anything contained in this division or Code to the contrary, any sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this division or Code or otherwise lawfully existing with a commercial message may, at the option of the owner, contain a noncommercial message in lieu of a commercial message. The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the owner of the sign, provided that the sign is not a prohibited sign or sign-type and provided that the size, height, setback and other dimensional criteria contained in this division and Code have been satisfied. 
(b)  Severability generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division. 
(c)  Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection (a), above, or elsewhere in this division, this Code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this article, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 
(d)  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs and sign elements. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in section 32-603(a) above, or elsewhere in this division, this Code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this article that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign elements that are prohibited by this division. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 5-1902, thereby ensuring that as many prohibited sign-types as may be constitutionally prohibited continue to be prohibited. 
(e)  It is the intent of the city to regulate signage in a manner that implements the purposes of this division as expressed in this division. The city finds that the purposes stated in this division are legitimate, substantial, and compelling public interests, that the regulation of signage provided by this division is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and that the incidental restrictions on expression that may occur as a result of these regulations is no more than is essential to the furtherance of the public interests. However, if a court of competent jurisdiction finds any regulation herein to be based upon content and, further, declares such regulation unconstitutional, then it is the intent of the city that only that portion of the provision that is found unconstitutional be severed from this division, and if it is not possible for the court to strike only the portion of the provision that is found unconstitutional, then it is the intent of the city that all signs that would be subject to the stricken provision will instead be subject to the next surviving provision for a sign of like geometry and character that is more restrictive than the stricken provision in terms of sign area.

Structural alteration shall not include changing removable copy type such as that usually located on theater marquees.

The application shall describe and set forth the following: 
(1)  The type of sign or sign structure.

Normal grade shall be construed to be the established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of locating or raising the height of the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined from the previous part of this definition, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower. 
b.  If the sign is composed of four or more individual cabinets or modules, the entire area within and enclosed by the exterior perimeter of all cabinets or modules within a single, continuous geometric figure shall be determined as the area of the sign. This shall include all open areas within those cabinet or module perimeters and all space separating the cabinets or modules. 
(2)  The entire area within a single, continuous perimeter composed of squares, rectangles or other geometric figures which enclose the extreme limits of all sign elements affixed to a wall, including but not limited to cabinet structures, written copy, logos, symbols, illustrations, decorative embellishments and painted backgrounds framing the sign elements, shall be computed as the sign area.

The director shall grant or deny a permit for a sign or structure within 30 days from the date a completed application was filed.

(Ord. No. 2010-09, § 4, 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 32-780. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES 

Sec. 32-781. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of development review is to encourage a more functional, efficient and compatible character of development, to promote logic, imagination, innovation and variety in project design, to preserve, protect and supplement the existing natural environment, to ensure that urban services delivery systems are not unduly overburdened by excessive or premature development, and to determine that all development occurs in full conformity to the county land use plan and, when adopted, the city comprehensive plan and elements of the plan. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. VII, § 1) 
Sec. 32-782. - Applicability. 
(a)  Review procedures. All applications for a development permit within the city shall be subject to development review procedures, including both site plan review and impact evaluation. Applications shall be classified as either of a minor or major nature for the purposes of determining procedural review and approval responsibilities. The following classifications are established: 
(1)  Minor development. Minor developments shall include those which contain less than ten residential dwelling units, or less than 4,000 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area and shall be subject only to staff review and approval. 
(2)  Major development. Major developments shall include those which contain ten residential dwelling units or more, or 4,000 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area or more and shall be subject to review by staff and the planning and zoning board, and review and approval by the city commission. 
(3)  Major development with administrative review. Certain development applications in the Central RAC zoning district that would otherwise qualify as major developments are subject only to staff review and approval; see section 32-205(a). 
(4)  Division of proposed developments prohibited. Applicants may not divide or phase developments to avoid being subject to major development classification. If an applicant obtains approval for a minor development, and, within two years from that approval, that applicant or his successor in interest, submits another application for a development permit on the same parcel of property that, together with the previously approved development, would qualify as a major development, then the entire project, including that portion previously approved, shall be subject to the requirements for major developments. 
(b)  Development permits other than building permits. The purpose of this subsection is to provide a process for conducting the required development review of applications for development permits that do not contain a complete, specific site development proposal. For example, applications for rezoning or plat approval frequently do not submit detailed site plans and specific site development information. However, the impact evaluation portion of the development review process must review a specific development proposal. Therefore, applications for development permits that do not include a complete, specific site development proposal shall, for impact evaluation purposes, be presumed to be the most intense development permitted under the applicable land development regulations. If different permitted uses in the applicable regulations have different impacts upon the services or facilities to be evaluated, the most intense impact on each separate service or facility shall be presumed. The applicable land development regulations may refer, where the context is appropriate, to either the current regulations or, as in a rezoning or variance, the regulations as proposed to be amended or varied. If the applicant submits a complete, specific site development proposal, meeting all submission requirements for both site plan approval and impact evaluation, as part of his application for a development permit, that application will be evaluated on the basis of that proposal. If the applicant for a rezoning, variance or plat approval submits a specific proposed use, but does not submit a complete site development proposal, impact evaluation of the rezoning shall focus on that proposed use. If he subsequently submits an application for building permits for a use other than, and, in any aspect, more intense than that submitted proposed use, he shall be subject to a new, complete impact evaluation process, as well as full site plan review. Further, if the requested development permit is granted based upon a complete, specific site development proposal, then a subsequent application for building permits shall not be subject to a new site plan and impact evaluation process and approval, subject to the following: 
(1)  The director may approve that subsequent application if he determines that: 
a.  There has not been any material and substantial change in the conditions existing at the time of the development permit approval; 
b.  The building permit application is in strict conformity with the complete, specific site development permit; and 
c.  The subsequent application for a building permit is made within one year from the date of final development permit approval. 
(2)  If the director's determination as to any of these conditions is negative, then a new, complete site plan review and impact evaluation process must be completed prior to issuance of any building permits, subject to the following: 
a.  If that determination is based upon a material or substantial change in conditions, then the new development review process shall consider only those changed conditions. 
b.  If that determination is based on a change in the site development proposal, then the new development review process shall consider only those items in the proposal that are changed. 
(3)  The costs and expenditures incurred by the applicant in accompanying his application for development permit with a complete, specific site development proposal, and in meeting all site plan review and impact evaluation requirements shall not, in any way, create for the applicant any expectation of or reliance on development approval. This is especially true with respect to rezoning or variance requests, which must be evaluated on factors such as conformity with the comprehensive plan, compatible land uses, and many other factors in addition to impact evaluation. 
(4)  If an applicant has had his rezoning, variance or plat application reviewed, in absence of a complete, specific site development proposal, and approved, on the basis of the presumption of the most intense development permitted under the applicable regulations, then, if the applicant submits a complete, specific site development proposal within one year from the date of approval, he shall be subject only to site plan review and not impact evaluation. 
(5)  If an applicant has had his rezoning, variance or plat application reviewed, in the absence of a complete, specific site development proposal, and approved, on the basis of his submission of a specific proposed use, then if the applicant submits a complete, specific site development proposal reflecting that proposed use within one year from the date of approval, he shall be subject only to site plan review and not impact evaluation. If he submits a complete, specific site development proposal for a different and, in any aspect, a more intense use, the application shall be subject to a new, complete site plan review and impact evaluation process. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. VII, § 2; Ord. No. 2014-32, § 8, 11-5-2014) 
Sec. 32-783. - Review procedures. 
(a)  Staff review. 
(1)  All applications for both minor and major developments, including required site plans and impact evaluation statements, shall be submitted by the applicant to the director, who shall review them to ascertain their compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. The directors shall transmit copies of relevant materials to those other departments and agencies, as appropriate, in order to perform a complete review, including but not limited to the police, fire, parks, engineering, utilities and finance departments. 
(2)  The director shall notify all adjacent units of local government within a 1,000-foot radius of any proposed major development that such a review is underway and solicit their input and recommendations. 
(b)  Staff action. The director shall have 60 calendar days from the date an application is filed to render a final decision on a minor development. Any aggrieved applicant shall have 14 calendar days from the date of that administrative decision to appeal to the city commission, in which event the city commission may proceed as specified in subsection (e) of this section. 
(c)  Board review. 
(1)  Applications for major development shall be transmitted within 90 days from the date an application in final form with all supporting documents is filed with the director, to the planning and zoning board for its review and consideration. The director shall include with that transmittal a written report and recommendation; and that transmittal should include, without limitation, all pertinent documents submitted by the applicant, reports of the reviewing city departments, and any other applicable documentation or graphic. 
(2)  An applicant may amend or modify the submitted application but in such case the time period for transmittal shall run from the director's receipt of the application as amended or modified. 
(d)  Board action. The planning and zoning board shall recommend to the city commission, within 120 days from the receipt of the director's transmittal and recommendation, that the proposed development be approved, approved with modifications or conditions, or denied. Extensions may be granted by the city commission upon the written request of the board for good cause. The board shall summarize the reasons for its advisory recommendations in a written report which shall be transmitted to the city commission through the director. 
(e)  City commission action. The director, upon receipt of the written report of the board, shall transmit the application to the city commission and place the item on the next available regular agenda. That transmittal may include, without limitations, all pertinent documents submitted by the applicant, the director's report and recommendation, the board report and any other applicable documentation or graphic. The city clerk shall keep all this material as part of the public record of the city commission. If the city commission determines that a proposed major development, together with other developments in the impact area, which have certificates of occupancy or valid building permits currently in effect, or for which capacity has been reserved, would not cause or result in a violation of the standards established by this article, and is in full compliance with other applicable laws, ordinances or regulations, then the city commission shall approve the application for development permit. If the city commission determines that the proposed development, together with other developments in the impact area, which have certificates of occupancy or valid building permits currently in effect, or for which capacity has been reserved, would cause or result in a violation of the standards established by this article, then the city commission may: 
(1)  Deny the application; 
(2)  Phase the application to ensure compliance with these standards; 
(3)  Modify the application so that these standards are met; or 
(4)  Grant conditional approval or modification of the application, attaching whatever reasonable conditions or requirements the city commission deems necessary to ensure compliance with these standards or maximum mitigation of the adverse impacts of the development. 
(f)  Development conditions. These conditions may include, without limitation, requiring the applicant, at his cost and expense, to: 
(1)  Finance or dedicate land for public rights-of-way, easements, parks and open space, or school sites; 
(2)  Finance or construct potable water, wastewater or drainage facilities; or 
(3)  Any other reasonable condition necessary to ensure compliance with these standards prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, if the applicant agrees in writing in a recordable agreement binding upon his successors and assigns, that no certificate of occupancy will be issued until the requirements of this article are met. Otherwise, all conditions must be satisfied prior to issuance of the development permit. Attachment of these conditions shall be voluntary on the part of the applicant; and agreement by the applicant to provide any conditions will not, in any way, obligate the city to approve the subject application. Any conditional approval shall be based solely on the fact that the development application, as modified or conditioned, meets the standards of this article, and may not be based solely on the granting of certain conditions deemed favorable by the city unless the standards of this article are met. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. VII, § 3) 
Sec. 32-784. - General information. 
(a)  Required information. All applications shall include the information specified in this section which shall relate to the overall capability of the applicant to actually develop the site, if approved.

(2)  The property owner has detrimentally relied on the prior zoning designation and regulation, in good faith, by making substantial expenditures for the future development of the property; and 
(3)  That it would be highly inequitable to deny the property owner the right to complete the development under the prior zoning designation and regulations. 
    A determination that a property owner is entitled to vested rights to develop under the prior zoning designation and regulations does not exempt the development from compliance with the standards set forth in chapter 32, zoning and land development, of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Hallandale Beach, which were in existence prior to the effective date of this section. 
    A denial of the request for vested rights by the city manager may be appealed to the city commission within 20 days of the date the property owner receives notice of said denial. To appeal the city manager's denial, the property owner shall file a notice of appeal with the city clerk, together with an appellate fee of $550.00. The city clerk shall notify the applicant in writing of the date and time of such hearing. The city commission shall hold a de novo hearing to consider whether the vested rights should have been granted. Appeals of decisions of the city commission may only be brought pursuant to applicable Florida Statutes. 
    If a determination is made that vested rights do exist, the property owner shall have six months from the date of the determination to submit application and obtain major development approval. The city manager, at his/her discretion and for good cause shown, may grant a six-month extension to obtain development plan approval. Pursuant to section 32-790, Code of Ordinances of Hallandale Beach, after approval of the major development, the property owner shall have 18 months to obtain a building permit. The city manager, at his/her discretion and for good cause shown, may grant a six-month extension to obtain a building permit. 
    This provision for requesting a vested rights determination shall expire 120 days after the effective date of this section. 
    For parcels greater than three acres refer to section 32-205(e)(1)c. of the Code of Ordinances.

Secs. 32-796-32-804. - Reserved. 
Sec. 32-805. - Development agreements; amendments and minor changes. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to provide for a clear and efficient process for consideration of requests for amendments or minor revisions to development agreements adopted pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act. 
(b)  Applicability. For development agreements currently in effect and adopted by the city pursuant to Florida Statutes, the procedures contained in this section apply to any request for an amendment or minor revision. 
(c)  Procedure for amendment to a development agreement. 
(1)  Development services review and recommendation. The development services director shall review requests for modifications to development agreements. If it is determined that the request for modification is a minor revision, approval shall be pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. If it is determined the request for modification is not a minor revision, it is a development agreement amendment and shall be reviewed pursuant to the following process. The development services director shall provide a recommendation to the planning and zoning board to approve, approve with modifications or deny the development agreement amendment. The development services director shall make findings as to each proposed development agreement amendment and shall forward such findings to the planning and zoning board. 
The findings shall be based on the following criteria: 
a.  Whether the development agreement amendment is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan, or as may be amended; and 
b.  Whether the provisions of the development agreement amendment are in the best interests of the public health, safety, welfare, economic order and aesthetics of the region and the community; and 
c.  Whether the development agreement amendment will adversely affect the orderly development of property in the area of the parcel of land subject to the development agreement amendment; and 
d.  Any findings required to be made pursuant to Florida Statutes. 
(2)  Planning and zoning board public hearing and recommendation. Upon consideration of the recommendations of the development services director, the planning and zoning board shall hold a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be published and mailed in accordance with Florida Statutes. Following the public hearing, and after review of the city administration recommendation and findings, the planning and zoning board shall make its written recommendation to the city commission and shall make a written finding certifying consistency with the items listed in subsections (1)a.-d. above. 
(3)  City commission public hearing and decision. Upon consideration of the recommendations of the planning and zoning board and the city administration, the city commission shall hold a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be published and mailed in accordance with Florida Statutes. Following the public hearing the city commission shall approve, or approve with modifications, or deny the proposed development agreement amendment. This does not preclude an additional public hearing(s) as may be required by law or as may be deemed appropriate by the city. 
(d)  Procedure for minor revisions to a development agreement. 
(1)  Review and approval by development services director. 
a.  Minor revisions to a development agreement may be approved pursuant to the city's home rule powers under the Florida Constitution and F.S. ch. 166, after review by the development services director. The findings shall be based on the following criteria: 
1.  The revision is substantially consistent with the overall purposes and intent of the approved development agreement; 
2.  The revision conforms to all other applicable city ordinances and regulations; 
3.  The revision does not require a change in any other provision of the development agreement that would require review under subsection (c) of the section herein; and 
4.  The revision is not inconsistent with the city's comprehensive plan. 
b.  A revision is considered minor if it includes one or more of the following: 
1.  Updates a development agreement to reflect an approved minor change to a major development plan pursuant to section 32-186(j)(2) of the City Code. 
2.  Changes provisions regarding easements or utilities so that more effective service levels can be achieved. 
3.  Corrects scriveners' errors. 
4.  Changes provisions which are specifically provided for as minor in the approved development agreement. 
5.  Changes time frames for development application review, as long as the modified schedule does not trigger any default dates that may exist within the agreement and the modified review time frames and all required improvements, can be accomplished without an extension of the expiration date of the agreement. 
6.  Changes resulting from revisions to any section or subsection numbers of amended Florida Statutes, Florida Administrative Code, or any other state or local law, so long as the substance of the state or local law has not changed. 
7.  Changes resulting from modifications to a city-run program referenced in the development agreement, so long as the intent and public purpose of the local program has not changed. 
8.  Extends the effective date of a current, unexpired development agreement if state law applicable to the development agreement requires such extension, so long as the developer follows the requirements of the law. 
9.  When a development agreement requires a letter of credit or maintenance bond, the change allows other forms of security interest, so long as any surety is approved by the city manager; provided, however, that any stated amount or percentage of the security interest remains the same. 
10.  Changes to the corporate name or address of developer when such changes have been accomplished through the state. 
11.  Changes to the name of the subject property or project, unless the name of the subject property listed in the development agreement is the same as an already-platted subdivision. 
(2)  If the development services director determines, when applying the above criteria, that the revision is minor, the revision shall be prepared, executed, and recorded in the public records of Broward County, without necessity of any public hearings before the planning and zoning board or city commission. If the development services director determines that the revision is not minor, (s)he shall state reasons in writing to the applicant, and the amendment shall be reviewed in accordance with subsection (c) of the section herein. If a minor revision is submitted for review while an application for a development agreement amendment is pending on the same property, the development services director may require review of the minor revision to be in conjunction with the development agreement amendment approval process. 
(e)  Periodic review of development agreements. Development services director shall review land subject to a development agreement at least once every 12 months to determine if there has been demonstrated good-faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement, in accordance with F.S. § 163.3235, or as may be amended. A written determination shall be made as to whether the developer has complied with the terms of the development agreement. 
    The development agreement may be revoked, modified, or canceled by the city at any time in accordance with Florida Statutes.

ARTICLE VI. - CONSISTENCY AND CONCURRENCY DETERMINATIONS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 32-821. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to describe the requirements and procedures for determination of consistency of proposed development projects with the city comprehensive plan, including meeting the concurrency requirements of the plan. 
(Code 1980, § 4.00.01) 
Sec. 32-822. - Presumption of general consistency. 
    Subject to the special provisions of this section relating to concurrency, and excepting aspects of the development addressed by the comprehensive plan but not covered by this article, a development proposal shall be presumed to be consistent with the city comprehensive plan, with respect to concurrency, if the proposal is found to meet all the requirements of this article in accordance with F.S. § 163.3202(2). 
(Code 1980, § 4.00.02) 
Sec. 32-823. - No presumption in favor of concurrency. 
    Notwithstanding the presumption created in section 32-822, all development applications for development orders shall demonstrate that specified public facilities will be available at prescribed levels of service, concurrent with the impact of the development on those facilities. Determination of compliance with the concurrency requirement shall be through procedures described in section 32-855. 
(Code 1980, § 4.00.03) 
Sec. 32-824. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

DIVISION 2. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 32-851. - Generally. 
    The following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the concurrency management system (CMS). The CMS is based upon the city comprehensive plan, especially the capital improvements element and adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a development order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services. The CMS also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards. 
(Code 1980, § 4.01.01) 
Sec. 32-852. - Adopted levels of service shall not be degraded. 
(a)  General rule. All applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city. 
(b)  Exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if prior to occupancy of the new facilities or any portion or phase, the prescribed levels of service will be met. For phased developments, the maximum period of time for degraded level of service shall be two years unless extended by the city commission. 
(Code 1980, § 4.01.02) 
Sec. 32-853. - Determination of available capacity. 
(a)  Method. For purposes of this article, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
a.  The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
b.  The total capacity of new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown: 
1.  Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of issuance of the final development order. 
2.  The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the final development order. 
3.  The new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 et seq., or an agreement or development order pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. Such facilities shall be consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
a.  The demand for the service or facility created by existing development as documented in the city comprehensive plan; and 
b.  The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments, redevelopment, or other development activity. 
(b)  Action upon failure to show available capacity. Where available capacity cannot be shown, the following methods may be used to maintain adopted levels of service: 
(1)  The project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service. In such case, the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service, and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with calculations of capacity. All improvements necessary to achieve or maintain adopted levels of service shall be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the completed development or phase. 
(2)  The proposed project may be altered such that projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service. 
(Code 1980, § 4.01.03) 
Sec. 32-854. - Burden of showing compliance on developer. 
(a)  The burden of showing compliance with levels of service requirements shall be upon the developer. In order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information showing compliance with these standards, as determined by the city. A concurrency evaluation application will be provided to the developer for completion. The application and associated forms will set forth the quantity and quality of written and graphic information necessary to show compliance with level of service requirements and shall at a minimum require: 
(1)  Name, address and telephone number of the property owner (signature of the owner must be notarized). 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant if other than the property owner. 
(3)  Proof of ownership which shall consist of at least one of the following: 
a.  A fee simple title. 
b.  An option to acquire fee simple title within a specified period of time. 
c.  A leasehold interest in excess of 20 years. 
d.  A substantial interest in a joint venture agreement or real estate syndication which has or can obtain a fee simple title. 
e.  A marketable title subject to a certain condition which will not substantially restrict development within a reasonable time. 
f.  An executed copy of the warranty deed. 
(4)  A certified plat of survey, prepared within one year from date of application, which includes: 
a.  An accurate legal description of the subject property; 
b.  A computation of the total area of property in square feet and to the nearest tenth of an acre; and 
c.  Zoning of the property. 
(5)  Description of proposed project, to include: 
a.  Specific use or uses proposed or proposed for expansion. 
b.  1.  For nonresidential uses, square footage of overall proposal and detailed breakdown of square footage for each individual use in a multiuse project. 
2.  For residential uses, number of dwelling units. 
(6)  County trips analysis paid for by the applicant, unless the development proposal is specifically exempted by this article, or if applicable, a traffic study as required by section 32-884. (Traffic studies required under this section shall be prepared by appropriate consultants retained by the city at the developer's expense.) 
(7)  On-site stormwater management plan prepared by a qualified professional engineer unless specifically exempted by section 32-855(b)(3). 
(8)  A detailed waste management plan which describes the method of collection and disposal. 
(b)  The concurrency evaluation shall be reviewed by the city manager and/or appropriate consultants retained by the city at the developer's expense for compliance with this article. Based on the review, a written finding of compliance or noncompliance shall be issued by the city manager. A finding of compliance shall expire and may be extended in the same manner as a development order, as described in section 32-855. 
(c)  Fees for concurrency evaluation are required. Such fees are on file in the city clerk's office. 
(Code 1980, § 4.01.04) 
Sec. 32-855. - Determination of concurrency. 
(a)  Generally. Determination of concurrency occurs during major or minor development review prior to the approval of a development order, in accordance with the level of service standards adopted by the city. If the developer increases the intensity or density of a development proposal during any stage in the development approval process, a new concurrency evaluation will be required. If no building permit is issued, the development order shall expire one year after the date of approval. A six-month extension may be granted by the city manager based on a written request which includes the reasons for the extension request. The request must be received within 20 days of the development order expiration date. 
(b)  Exceptions. 
(1)  Development for which a plat has been approved by the county commission subsequent to March 20, 1979, shall not be required to substantiate maintenance of the adopted level of service standard for roads with respect to state- and county-maintained roads only. Substantiation of maintenance of the adopted level of service standard for roads with respect to locally maintained roads is required for all developments unless specifically exempted in this subsection. 
(2)  Individual single-family and duplex developments that access local roads will not be required to substantiate maintenance of the adopted level of service standard for roads. 
(3)  Residential developments having ten or less parking spaces and where not more than 20 percent of the swale area adjacent to the public right-of-way is paved with any type of impervious material shall not be required to substantiate maintenance of the adopted level of service standard for drainage. 
(4)  Developments for which a development order has been approved by the city prior to December 1, 1989, have a vested right to develop their property as approved and are therefore exempt from the provisions of this article. However, in the event of an amendment to an approved development order, after December 1, 1989, the requirements of this article shall apply to the extent that the development, as amended, creates greater impacts upon the specified public facilities than the development as previously approved. In addition, if the development order expires as described in subsection (a) of this section, the development's vested right shall be void. 
(5)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, applications for development orders that will not have an impact on the affected public facilities, as determined by the city, are exempt from concurrency requirements. 
(Code 1980, § 4.01.05) 
Sec. 32-856. - Annual report. 
(a)  Contents. The city shall prepare an annual report on the concurrency management system that includes: 
(1)  a.  A summary of actual development activity, including a summary of certificates of occupancy, indicating quantity of development represented by type and square footage. 
b.  A summary of actual demolition activity indicating the quantity of removed development by type and square footage.

DIVISION 3. - LEVELS OF SERVICE 

Sec. 32-881. - Adopted. 
    Level of service standards adopted in this article are provided to implement the per capita level of service standards adopted in the city comprehensive plan. Generalized categories of land use and corresponding average values for facility demand are provided to allot available facility capacity to a particular development proposal. This process is intended to provide a measure with which to determine the impacts of a proposed development on the affected public facilities. Available capacities for potable water and wastewater facilities will be adjusted on an annual basis by the city based on actual usage figures from facility providers. For purposes of determining available capacity for wastewater treatment and potable water supply, the adequacy of sewer and water transmission lines shall be considered in addition to plant capacity.

Sec. 32-884. - Transportation system. 
(a)  Level of service (LOS). Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following level of service (LOS) for transportation systems as established in the city comprehensive plan: 
(1)  The minimum peak hour level of service standard for all transportation facilities is D. 
(2)  Road segments currently operating at LOS A, B or C may degrade to LOS D. Road segments operating at LOS D will not be permitted to degrade to LOS E or F, except during construction of new facilities as provided for in this section or as follows: 
a.  For the purpose of issuing development orders, the LOS for road segments operating below level of service D in the TRIPS model, as identified in the county administrative code, that are constrained facilities is "110% Maintain." 
b.  For the purpose of issuing development orders, the LOS for road segments operating below level of service D in the TRIPS model, as identified in the county administrative code, that are planned improvement facilities is "110% Maintain" and requires a finding by the city manager and/or a traffic consultant retained by the city at the developer's expense, that approval of the development would not prevent the planned improvement from achieving level of service D. 
c.  For the purpose of issuing development orders or permits, the LOS for all road segments included within a special transportation area shall be consistent with the LOS established by the plan amendment designating the special transportation area. (Requires city comprehensive plan amendment.) 
(b)  Determination of project impact. The impact of proposed development activity on available capacity shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  The area of impact of the development (a traffic shed) shall be determined by the city or traffic consultant retained by the city at the developer's expense. The traffic shed shall be that area where the primary impact of traffic to and from the site occurs. 
(2)  The projected level of service for roads within the traffic shed shall be calculated based upon estimated trips to be generated by the project using the county TRIPS model as a basis. If the county TRIPS model is unable to generate level of service figures for a particular road segment within the traffic shed, for any reason, the city manager may require submission of a traffic study prepared by a traffic consultant retained by the city at the developer's expense. 
(3)  The projected and adopted level of service shall be compared to determine whether the proposed project will degrade the adopted level of service. 
(4)  All necessary rights-of-way shall be reserved by dedication, or easement if acceptable to the city, prior to approval of the final development order. 
(5)  All roadway improvements shall be constructed in compliance with city engineering specifications and requirements.

Sec. 32-885. - Drainage system. 
    Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following level of service for the drainage system as established in the city comprehensive plan. For all development, five-year; one-hour storm event (the site must have the capacity to retain on the site the stormwater generated by a five-year severity one-hour storm event (3.3 inches of water in one hour) by means of collection and groundwater recharge). 
(Code 1980, § 4.02.04) 
Sec. 32-886. - Solid waste. 
(a)  Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following levels of service for the solid waste as established in the city comprehensive plan. Since the city utilizes waste disposal facilities provided by others and therefore capacity cannot be reserved for particular developments, a determination of available capacity will be issued to the developer by the city manager. 
Facility Type Level of

(b)  Residential development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following level of service for the recreational facilities as established in the city comprehensive plan: 
All park facilities level of service, per 1,000 population ..... 3 acres 
(Code 1980, § 4.02.06) 
Sec. 32-888. - Public school concurrency. 
(a)  School facilities. There shall be school facilities sufficient to provide for the needs of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the impact area which have certificates of occupancy or for which valid building permits are currently in effect or for which school capacity has been reserved. 
(b)  Public school concurrency. Pursuant to the Public School Facilities Element (PSFE) of the City of Hallandale Beach Comprehensive Plan and the Amended Interlocal Agreement (ILA), the city, in collaboration with the Broward County School Board, shall ensure public school facilities will be available for current and future students, consistent with available financial resources and adopted level of service standards, and such facilities will be available concurrent with the impact of proposed residential development. 
(1)  Applications subject to a public school concurrency determination. The city shall not approve an application for a residential plat, replat, plat note amendment, findings of adequacy, or any unincorporated area site plan (application) that generates one or more students or is not exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency, until the school board has reported that the school concurrency requirement has been satisfied. 
(2)  Exemptions and vested development. 
a.  The following residential applications shall be exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency: 
1.  An application which generates less than one student at each level in the relevant concurrency service area. Such development shall be subject to the payment of school impact fees. 
2.  An application for age-restricted communities with no permanent residents under the age of 18. Exemption for an age-restricted community shall only be available subject to a recorded restrictive covenant prohibiting the residence of school-aged children in a manner consistent with federal, state, or local laws or regulations. 
3.  A development of regional impact (DRI) with a development order issued before the effective date of Senate Bill 360 or an application submitted before May 1, 2005. 
4.  As may otherwise be exempted by Florida Statutes, including but not limited to applications within municipalities which meet specific qualifying criteria outlined in the applicable statute and approved by the school board. 
b.  The following residential applications shall be vested from the requirements of public school concurrency: 
1.  Any application located within a previously-approved comprehensive plan amendment or rezoning which is subject to a mitigation agreement in accordance with the following: 
i.  The mitigation to address the impact of the new students anticipated from the development has been accepted by the school board consistent with School Board Policy 1161, entitled "Growth Management," as may be amended from time to time; and 
ii.  A declaration of restrictive covenants executed and recorded by the developer or the development is located within a boundary area that is subject to an executed and recorded tri-party agreement consistent with School Board Policy 1161, as may be amended from time to time; and 
iii.  The applicant shall provide a letter from the school board or other evidence acceptable to the city verifying [subsections] a. and b. above. Other evidence may include documentation as specified in the tri-party agreement. 
2.  Any application which is included within a residential plat or development agreement for which school impacts have been satisfied for the dwelling units included in the proposed application. This includes any unexpired application approved by the city between February 2, 1979, and the effective date of the PSFE and this section. In the transmittal of an application to the school board, the city shall include written information indicating that the units in the application are vested. 
c.  To be exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency, an applicant seeking such a determination shall be required to submit documentation with the application which shall include written evidence sufficient to verify that the subject development meets the exemptions states herein and, as such, is exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency. 
(3)  Level of service standards. The level of service standard (LOS) shall be 110 percent of the permanent Florida Inventory of School Housing (FISH) capacity for each concurrency service area. The LOS shall be achieved and maintained within the period covered by the five-year schedule of capital improvements contained in the effective five-year adopted District Educational Facilities Plan (DEFP). 
(4)  Concurrency service area (CSA). The areas for implementation of public school concurrency in the city shall be known as concurrency service areas (CSAs), which shall be the approved school boundaries for elementary, middle and high schools, as annually adopted by the school board. For the purpose of public school concurrency, such CSAs shall be effective on the first day of the school year, and end on the last day before the beginning of the next school year. 
(5)  Student generation rates. The effective adopted student generation rate(s) contained herein shall be utilized to determine the potential student impact anticipated from the residential development proposed in submitted applications. 
(6)  Review procedure. 
a.  Public school impact application (PSIA). Any applicant submitting an application with a residential component that is not exempt or vested is subject to school concurrency and shall be required to submit a public school impact application (PSIA) for review by the school board. Evidence of acceptance of the PSIA and payment of the applicable PSIA fee to the school board shall be required prior to acceptance of the application by the city. 
b.  School capacity availability determination (SCAD) letter. 
1.  No residential application or amendments thereto shall be approved by the city, unless the residential development is exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency, until a SCAD letter has been received from the school board confirming that capacity is available; or, if capacity is not available, the proportionate share mitigation has been accepted by the school board. The SCAD letter shall be sent to the applicant, the Broward County Development Management Division, and the city with jurisdiction over the subject development, no later than 45 days after acceptance of the PSIA by the school board. 
2.  The school board shall determine the potential student impact from proposed residential development on the applicable CSA by performing the review procedure specified in School Board Policy 1161, as amended. 
3.  If the school board determines that sufficient capacity is available at the adopted LOS to accommodate students anticipated from the development, the school board shall issue a SCAD letter indicating that adequate school facilities exist to accommodate the student impact and the proposed development satisfies public school concurrency requirements. 
4.  If the school board determines that sufficient permanent capacity is not available at the adopted LOS to accommodate students anticipated from the development, the SCAD letter shall state that the development has not satisfied public school concurrency requirements and the basis for such determination. The applicant shall have 30 days to propose proportionate share mitigation to the school board. 
5.  If the applicant proposes proportionate share mitigation within the 30-day deadline, upon the subsequent acceptance of the proposed mitigation by the school board, and upon the execution of a legally-binding document among the school board, the city, and the applicant, an amended SCAD letter shall state that adequate capacity anticipated from the accepted proportionate share mitigation will be available to accommodate the student impact anticipated from the proposed development and that the proposed development satisfies public school requirements. The total amount committed for any mitigation option shall not be less than the school impact fees due for the proposed units, as calculated based upon the adopted school impact fee schedule contained herein. The school impact fee due for the development shall be considered included in the total proportionate share mitigation amount due or paid. If the proportionate share mitigation is not accepted by the school board, the amended SCAD letter shall state the basis upon which the mitigation proposal(s) was rejected and why the development is not in compliance with public school concurrency requirements. 
6.  An applicant adversely impacted by a SCAD determination may appeal such determination by written request to the school board within the designated 30-day time period. A timely request for an appeal shall stay the requirement for an applicant to propose proportionate share mitigation until the appeal has been resolved. 
7.  If an applicant or approval expires, the SCAD letter will no longer be valid. 
(7)  Expiration of concurrency/vesting. 
a.  The public school concurrency approval for a residential application shall expire if development does not commence, as outlined in [subsection] b. below, within five years following the date of city commission approval. 
b.  If a residential application received approval, the development and anticipated students shall be considered vested for up to five years beginning from the date the developer received approval from the city. Vesting of a residential application beyond five years requires that one of the following conditions is met within the five-year period: (1) the issuance of a building permit for a principal building and first inspection approval; or (2) substantial completion of project water lines, sewer lines, and the rock base for internal roads. If the development was denied, the school board shall deduct students associated with the development from its database.

Editor's note- The subsections of § 32-888 have been renumbered for purposes of classification, at the editor's discretion, as set out herein. 
Secs. 32-889-32-920. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 32-921. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is the purpose and intent of this article to permit, except as otherwise specifically provided, the continuation of those lots, structures, uses, characteristics of use or combinations which were lawful before the passage of this chapter, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments to this chapter. For purposes of this chapter, a nonconforming lot, structure, use or characteristic of use is defined as a lot, structure or use, or combination, that does not comply with the land development standards of the zoning district in which the lot, structure, use or characteristic of use or combination is located, but which was legally established and in existence before November 21, 1978. 
(b)  This article is designed to provide reasonable and equitable standards and guidelines for the control of: 
(1)  Nonconforming lots, structures, uses and characteristics of uses in the regulation of change of use; 
(2)  Change in kind or quality of use; 
(3)  Change in volume or intensity of use; 
(4)  Change in location of use; 
(5)  Change of ownership or tenancy of use; 
(6)  Accessory or incidental uses to nonconforming lots, structures, uses, or characteristics of uses; 
(7)  Enlargement of use; 
(8)  Replacement of use; 
(9)  Addition or expansion of facilities; 
(10)  New activities, products or services connected with the nonconforming lot, structure or use; 
(11)  The alteration of a nonconforming structure; 
(12)  Repair of a nonconforming structure; 
(13)  Restoration of a nonconforming structure; and 
(14)  Abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming structure or use; 
or any combination. 
(c)  It is the further purpose and intent of this article to allow nonconforming lots, structures, uses and characteristics of use and combinations to continue, except as otherwise specifically provided, subject to specific conditions, in order not to interfere with the existing circumstances surrounding land development within the city prior to the effective date of this article more than is necessary for the proper exercise of police powers relating to the general public welfare of the citizens and residents of the city. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.01) 
Sec. 32-922. - Nonconforming classifications. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, or amendments that may be later adopted to this chapter, there may exist: 
(1)  Nonconforming lots. 
(2)  Nonconforming structures. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses. 
(4)  Nonconforming characteristics of use. 
(5)  Combinations of nonconforming lots, nonconforming structures, nonconforming uses and nonconforming characteristics of use. 
These nonconforming classifications are declared by this article to be incompatible with present permitted uses and all or part of the property development standards regulating permitted uses in the zoning district in which the nonconforming classifications are located and, therefore, are the proper subject regulation as provided for in this article. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.02) 
Sec. 32-923. - Scope. 
    In order to avoid undue hardship on the citizens and residents of the city, nothing in this article shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully done prior to November 21, 1978, and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. For purposes of this section, the term "actual construction" is defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner according to approved plans for the specific improvement. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun, preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work has been and shall be carried on diligently pursuant to a valid building permit. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.03) 
Sec. 32-924. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  In any district in which single-family detached dwellings are permitted, a single-family detached dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a single lot, tract or parcel of land of record on November 21, 1978, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this article. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not be of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width, depth or density that are applicable in the zoning district in which the lot, parcel or tract, is located; however, required yard or area dimensions and requirements other than those property regulations applying to area, width or depth shall conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is located. 
(b)  If two or more lots, or combinations of lots, or portions of lots with continuous frontage and single ownership are of record on November 21, 1978, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot area, width or depth, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this article; and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes the degree of compliance with lot width, area and depth requirements established by this article; nor shall any division of any parcel be allowed which creates a lot with area, width or depth, or all, less than the requirements stated in this section. 
(1)  When two or more adjoining and vacant lots or parcels with continuous frontage or area are under the same ownership on or after November 21, 1978, such lots shall be considered as one tract so as to create one or more lots or parcels which conform to the minimum frontage, area and density requirements of the district in which they are located, and as further provided for in this article. 
(2)  When an individual lot or parcel has an area smaller than the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot or parcel of record, on November 21, 1978, the permitted uses of the zoning district will be allowed on such lot or parcel, providing all requirements, other than building site area, are maintained. 
This subsection shall not apply where two or more lots or parcels adjoin in such a fashion that should they be considered as one lot or parcel, such single lot or parcel would meet all minimum requirements as to area and dimensions, provided that all the area so considered is in the same ownership. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.04) 
Sec. 32-925. - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    A nonconforming use may be continued if it lawfully existed on November 21, 1978, or at the time when the use was thereafter prohibited, subject to the following limitations and restrictions: 
(1)  Change in location of use. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use on November 21, 1978. 
(2)  Change of ownership or tenancy. All rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming use of land run with the land and are not personal to the present owner or tenant of the nonconforming use of land and are not affected by a change in ownership or tenancy, except if abandoned. 
(3)  Accessory or incidental uses. Uses accessory to a nonconforming use not in existence on November 21, 1978, are not permitted. 
(4)  Change to a more restrictive or equally restrictive category of use. 
a.  A nonconforming use may be changed to a more restrictive category of nonconforming use if the resulting change reduces the degree of nonconformity with applicable site development standards and use regulations. For the purpose of this section, a more restrictive category shall be a use or site development standard contained within a more restrictive zoning district. 
b.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar character, provided the director shall find that the resulting change does not increase the degree of nonconformity with applicable site development standards and use regulations and that the relation of the structure to surrounding properties is such that adverse effects on occupants and neighboring properties will not be greater than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the director may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(5)  Expansion or extension. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, expanded, extended or intensified beyond what existed at the time it became nonconforming. 
(6)  Replacement of use. If any existing nonconforming use as provided for in this article is destroyed by more than 50 percent of its assessed value at the time of destruction as determined by the official records of the county property appraiser by any means, including fire, flood, wind, explosion, act of God, or act of a public enemy, such use shall not be replaced. If such nonconforming use is destroyed to a level less than 50 percent of its total assessed value at the time of destruction as determined by the official records of the county property appraiser, it may be replaced; except that replacement can only occur in compliance with those building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire, and other construction and safety related regulations in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement. In no event shall the destroyed nonconforming use be replaced to a degree or level greater than the original use as to height, lot coverage, total floor area, bulk, or yard setback requirements. 
(7)  Abandonment of use. The abandonment of a nonconforming use for a period of 180 consecutive days shall render the nonconforming use status of the specific nonconforming use null and void. In the factual determination or whether a nonconforming use has been abandoned, the following factors shall be used, but are not limited to: 
a.  An intent to abandon the nonconforming use through removal of stock in trade or removal of operating equipment. 
b.  Some overt act or failure to act which carries with it a sufficient implication that the owner neither claims nor retains any interest in the abandoned property as it stood before the abandonment has occurred. The mere renewal and maintenance of an active occupational license, without more, shall not raise any presumption that the nonconforming use has not been abandoned. 
(8)  Redevelopment area; abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming uses. 
a.  In areas of the city that have been properly designated as redevelopment areas pursuant to the definition contained in section 32-8 of this chapter, upon application by the owner of the property or by any other person interested in the property and having the owner's consent, the standards of subsection (7) of this section may be modified by the city commission in order to allow the rehabilitation of structures previously certified for residential dwelling use. The city commission may determine that a structure that meets the criteria of this article be deemed not to have been abandoned or its use discontinued, or the city commission may extend the 180-day period of abandonment or discontinuance of use provided in subsection (7) of this section, upon finding that the following criteria are satisfied: 
1.  The subject structure is a structure that was a legally existing permitted or nonconforming use prior to the adoption of city Ordinance No. 78-60 on November 21, 1978. 
2.  The structure was previously certified for human occupancy as a single-family or multiple-family residential dwelling; or, in the absence of adequate records, physical evidence and affidavits attesting to the fact that a structure was previously constructed and used for residential purposes may be used in lieu of certificate of occupancy documents. 
3.  The structure is presently in sufficiently sound condition that major structural supporting members do not require replacement in order to rehabilitate the structure and render it certifiable for human occupancy as a residential dwelling. In making the determination required by this section, the commission may request that the structure be examined by the appropriate building inspectors of the city in order to determine whether major structural changes will be necessary in order to rehabilitate the dwelling. 
4.  Such structure is otherwise suitable for rehabilitation for use for residential dwelling purposes. 
If the criteria in this subsection are met by the structure in question and the city commission shall so determine, the structure may be deemed a legal nonconforming use which has not been abandoned; and it may be redeveloped to the category of the use specified on the last certificate of occupancy issued for the structure. In the absence of such certificate of occupancy, physical evidence and affidavits attesting to the category of use may be utilized in determining the allowable characteristics of the rehabilitated structure. Notwithstanding full compliance with every provision of this section, no structure to which this section may be applicable or which shall have been converted by the city commission to a legal nonconforming use pursuant to this section shall be subject to rehabilitation if such rehabilitated structure shall constitute a use of greater intensity or density of residential units than was permitted by the last certificate of occupancy for the structure in question, or shall otherwise result in a density of more than 25 units per acre, whichever is less. In the absence of a certificate of occupancy, the commission may utilize physical evidence and/or affidavits to determine the original intensity or density of use. 
b.  Any structure in a redevelopment area that may be rehabilitated for use as a residential dwelling, pursuant to subsection (8)a., shall comply with all current requirements of this chapter as to landscaping and parking; however, the city commission may, in its discretion, waive any or all such requirements upon application of the owner or other person interested in the property, submitted simultaneously with the application as provided in subsection (8)a. of this section. 
c.  Every application submitted in accordance with subsection (8)a., b. of this section shall include a statement of the applicant's interest in the property, and if the applicant is someone other than the owner, a statement showing the consent of the owner to such application, and a sketch plan of the site drawn to scale. Each application will be processed in accordance with the redevelopment area modification procedure established by section 32-175. 
d.  Providing a parcel has not been subdivided or otherwise reduced in size except for public right-of-way purposes, where application is made pursuant to subsection (8)a. of this section, the city commission may, if it finds the criteria of subsection (8)a. of this section are otherwise met, waive the density cap of 25 units per acre to allow a density in excess of 25 units per acre but not in excess of the number of residential units existing on the parcel of land. 
(9)  Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. No building or premises wherein or whereon a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of at least 180 consecutive days shall again be devoted to any use prohibited by this Code of Ordinances. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.05) 
Sec. 32-926. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and it could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or other property development standards or requirements concerning the structure, such structure, except as otherwise specifically provided, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Alteration, extension, enlargement, or expansion of nonconforming structure. Except for as provided in subsection a. below, no such alteration, extension, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted in a way which increases its noncompliance with present property development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located; but any nonconforming structure or portion may be altered to decrease its noncompliance with present property development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the director from ordering the compliance with all applicable building construction and safety related codes. 
a.  Setback exception. In the case of nonconforming side yard or rear yard setbacks, existing single-family and two-family buildings may be authorized to expand provided the existing setback of the building is met. 
(2)  Replacement, restoration and reconstruction of nonconforming structure. If any existing nonconforming structure, as provided for in this section, is destroyed by any means, including fire, flood, wind, explosion, act of God, or act of a public enemy by less than 50 percent of its total appraised value according to the latest records of the county property appraiser, such structure shall be permitted to be replaced, restored or reconstructed according to the property development standards in effect at the time of its original construction; except that replacement, restoration and reconstruction can only occur in compliance with those building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire and other construction and safety related regulations in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement, restoration, or reconstruction. In no event shall the destroyed nonconforming structure be replaced to a degree or level greater than the original structure as to height, lot coverage, total floor area, yard setback requirements or other applicable property development regulations at the time of original construction. 
(3)  Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures. Routine repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures on fixtures, wiring or plumbing or on the repair or replacement of walls shall be permitted. 
(4)  Change in location of nonconforming structure. Should any nonconforming structure be moved for any reason to any distance whatever from its original permitted location, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(5)  Accessory or incidental structures. Structures normally accessory to or incidental to a permitted structure or permitted use in the zoning district in which the nonconforming structure is located may be permitted as accessory structures to the nonconforming structure. 
(6)  Abandonment of nonconforming structure. The abandonment of a nonconforming structure for a period of 180 consecutive days shall render the nonconforming structure status of the specific nonconforming structure null and void. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.06; Ord. No. 2004-29, § 1, 12-7-2004) 
Sec. 32-927. - Nonconforming characteristics of use. 
    For purposes of this article, characteristics of use, such as off-street parking and loading and landscape requirements, shall be interpreted to be synonymous with and a part of the nonconforming classification of uses and structures legally permitted and existing at the time of the passage of this chapter or an amendment to this chapter, although such characteristics of use do not conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.07) 
Sec. 32-928. - Nonconforming lots, structures, use characteristics and uses in combination. 
    If, on the effective date of this chapter, a lot of record, structure, use or characteristic of use of land, in any combination, exists that would not be permitted under the terms of this chapter, but was lawful at the time of its original existence, that use may be continued unless otherwise deemed abandoned or terminated or required to be eliminated or brought into conformance by other applicable provisions of this chapter. Sections 32-925 and 32-926 shall apply to all nonconforming lots of record, structures, uses and characteristics of use, and combinations of any or all of them. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.08) 
Sec. 32-929. - Nonconforming outdoor uses. 
    All primary and accessory outdoor uses which are nonconforming shall be discontinued within one year of the final adoption of this chapter. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. III, § 4.09) 
Sec. 32-930. - Nonconforming classifications created by the issuance of variances prior to the effective date of this chapter. 
(a)  Nonconforming lots, structures, uses, characteristics of use and combinations that were legally in existence or under construction on the effective date of this chapter as a result of variances issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be considered nonconforming lots, structures, uses or characteristics of use under the terms of this chapter; and such variances shall be continued as though they had been granted under the terms of this chapter. Renewable variances granted prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be continued following the effective date of this chapter with no further requirement for renewal. 
(b)  This section shall not apply to variances issued to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages with less than the restrictions imposed by chapter 5. Neither shall this section apply to variances from the terms of any parking ordinance other than those variances from the terms of article IV, division 11 of this chapter. 
(c)  Variances issued prior to the effective date of this chapter which allow the sale of alcoholic beverages with less than the minimum restrictions imposed by chapter 5, and which were issued as annually renewable variances, shall continue to be annually renewable under the terms of this article.

Sec. 32-962. - Review standards. 
    In review of applications for land use amendments, rezonings, conditional uses and variances, the standards of this article shall be observed by the city commission, planning and zoning board and director in making any decisions or recommendations. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. VI, § 1(intro. ¶)) 
Sec. 32-963. - Land use plan amendments and rezonings. 
    Decisions or recommendations relating to any change to the official zoning map or the land use element of the comprehensive plan shall address but is not limited to the effect of the proposed amendment as it relates to the following: 
(1)  The relationship of the proposed amendment to the purposes and objectives of the city's comprehensive land use plan, when adopted, with appropriate consideration as to whether or not the proposed changes will further the purpose of this chapter and other codes, regulations and actions designed to implement the plan. 
(2)  The proposed change would or would not be contrary to the established land use pattern. 
(3)  The proposed change would or would not create an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts. 
(4)  The proposed change would or would not alter the population density pattern and thereby have an adverse impact upon public facilities such as schools, utilities and streets. 
(5)  Existing district boundaries are illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change. 
(6)  Changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary. 
(7)  Substantial reasons exist why the property cannot be used in accordance with the adopted land use plan and/or the existing zoning. 
(8)  Whether or not the change is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood. 
(Code 1980, app. A, art. VI, § 1.01) 
Sec. 32-964. - Conditional uses. 
    Applications for conditional uses shall be reviewed with consideration given to the following: 
(1)  That the use is compatible with the existing natural environment and other properties within the neighborhood. 
(2)  That the use will create no substantial detrimental effects on property values in the neighborhood. 
(3)  That there are adequate public facilities such as schools, roads, parks and utilities within the service areas involved. 
(4)  That there will be adequate provisions for the traffic movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, both internal to the use and in the area which will serve the use. 
(5)  That there will be adequate drainage systems to service the use with particular attention to the necessity for on-site retention systems to alleviate drainage and pollution problems. 
(6)  That there are adequate setbacks, buffering and general amenities in order to control any adverse effects of noise, light, dust and other nuisances. 
(7)  That the land area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for the use and for any reasonably anticipated expansion of the use.

(Code 1980, app. A, art. VI, § 1.02) 
Sec. 32-965. - Variances. 
(a)  A variance to the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary and undue hardship may be granted by the city commission in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, unless the request is for a variance not exceeding 25 percent of the applicable dimensional requirement of this chapter or 20 percent for sign code requirements and the request complies with subsections (b)(2) and (5) of this section. In that event, the variance is administrative in nature and the procedure of subsection (h) of this section applies. 
    The planning and zoning board is authorized to render final approval on variances that are not administrative and are minor developments as defined in section 32-782(a)(1) of this chapter. The variance application must comply with subsection (b) and subsection (h)(2) in order to be considered by the planning and zoning board. Upon a negative finding by the board, the applicant may withdraw the application or elect to appeal the board's decision by filing a notice of appeal to the city commission. 
(b)  In order to authorize any variances to the terms of this chapter, it must be found that: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not generally applicable to other lands, structures or building in the same zoning district. 
(2)  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
(3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings or structures in the same district. 
(4)  Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the rights commonly enjoyed by the properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardships on the applicant. 
(5)  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(6)  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(7)  Such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(c)  Appropriate conditions and safeguards, in conformity with this chapter, may be prescribed as a condition of the granting of the variance and violation of such conditions shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(d)  Under no circumstances shall a variance be granted for a use which is first permitted in a less restrictive district. No nonconforming use of neighboring land, structures or buildings in the same zoning district and no permitted use of lands, structures or building in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. 
(e)  A variance granted under the provisions of this chapter shall automatically expire under the following conditions: 
(1)  If a permit has not been issued by the building official within six months form the date of granting of the variance (or date of any final court order granting or modifying the variance), in accordance with the specific plans for which that variance was granted. 
(2)  If a permit is issued within the required time period, if work has not been completed and certificate of occupancy has not been issued under that permit. 
(3)  If a permit issued within the required time period shall expire or be revoked pursuant to the Florida Building Code, and if the time period for originally obtaining a permit has expired, the variance shall automatically expire. 
(f)  Extensions to expiring variances may be made by the city commission for a single one-year period, or portion of a year, upon receipt of written request from the applicant not less than 45 days before the expiration of the approved variance, stating the reasons for the extension request. 
(g)  Applications for variances will not be considered with respect to the following: 
(1)  Buildings and structures for which application has been made, either formal or informal and been denied by the city, but the building or structure is later constructed. 
(2)  Where plans have been submitted and approved and permits issued and the building or improvement not built according to plan. 
(3)  Where plans have been submitted and approved and permits issued but additional work not shown on the approved plans has been done. 
Fees shall be charged for applications for variances where buildings or structures were constructed without permits. Such fees are on file in the city clerk's office. 
All applications for variance under this article shall specify the name of the contractor who performed the work and the value of the work performed. 
With respect to applications involving property or uses within residential districts (RS, RD and RM districts) the fees shall cover all variances requested. Applications involving property or uses in other use districts shall pay an additional fee of half the applicable amount for each additional variance requested. 
(h)  Administrative variances may be granted by the director of development services under the provisions of this section if: 
(1)  The application complies with the application requirements in section 32-966(c), and does not exceed 25 percent of the applicable dimensional requirement or 20 percent for sign under this chapter. 
(2)  The application is for variance of minimum lot area, minimum lot width, minimum yard setbacks, maximum height, minimum landscaping requirements, off street parking and loading, and signage. 
(3)  The development services director shall consider subsections (b)(2) and (5) of this section; development patterns of the area; particulars of the application; and good planning practice in granting or denying the variance. 
(4)  Upon a positive finding of the application by the development services director, all property owners within 150 feet of the property will receive a courtesy notice by first class mail stating the following: 
a.  Type and nature of administrative variance being considered; 
b.  The place and time the application may be reviewed; and 
c.  Notification that any protest by a noticed property owner will be required in writing within ten working days from the date of the courtesy notice. 
(5)  Upon a negative finding by the development services director, or a written protest from a property owner as identified in subsection (h)(4) of this section, the applicant may withdraw or elect to submit the variance request to the city commission. 
(6)  No additional variance fees will be required if the applicant elects to proceed in accordance with subsection (h)(5) of this section.

Sec. 32-969. - Zoning relief procedures. 
(a)  In order to address possible unintended violations of federal and state laws, subsequent to implementation of this chapter in advance of costly litigation, zoning relief may be granted pursuant to this section. 
(1)  Application . A person or entity shall request relief under this section prior to filing a lawsuit, by completing a zoning relief request form, which is available from the city's development services department. The form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for evaluating the relief requested. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the applicant to supplement the form by identifying specific provisions of federal and/or state law permitting the applicant to operate despite this chapter. 
(2)  Hearing and notice . Subject to subsection (4), the public hearing shall be held no later than 90 days from the time that the application is complete, unless extensions are mutually agreed upon. A notice of hearing advising the public of the location, date and time of the public hearing on the request for zoning relief shall be provided by mail to property owners within 300 feet, if the request for relief is site specific, in accordance with the courtesy notice requirements of section 32-1004(c) of the Code. 
(3)  Hearing and determination . The city commission shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for zoning relief submitted to the development services department. During the public hearing, the city commission shall solicit comment and information from the public and shall decide whether to grant the requested relief, and the minutes recording the decision shall specifically be prepared for this hearing, no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the public hearing. The determination may: 
a.  Grant the relief requested; 
b.  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, or impose conditions upon the grant of the request; or 
c.  Deny the request. 
The minutes shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested once approved or denied by the city commission. 
(4)  Additional information . Prior to the public hearing, the city may request additional information from the applicant, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. In the event a request for additional information is made by the city, the 90-day period to schedule a hearing may be extended for another 30 days to include the time necessary to seek and review the additional information by the applicant. The applicant shall have 15 days after the date the information is requested to provide the needed information. If the applicant fails to timely respond with the requested additional information, the city shall provide notice to the applicant that the claim has been rejected due to insufficient information, and the applicant shall be required to re-apply for zoning relief. 
(5)  Criteria . In determining whether the zoning relief request shall be granted or denied, the applicant shall be required to establish: 
a.  The applicant's claim that it is protected under a federal or state law; and 
b.  The applicant believes in good faith that the city through implementation of its Zoning and Land Development Code has intentionally or unintentionally violated federal or state law for the reasons stated in the zoning relief request; and 
c.  The applicant satisfies the standard set forth in the applicable federal or state statute(s), and legal precedent interpreting the applicable statute(s). 
(6)  Exhaustion required . Completion of the zoning relief procedures shall be a supplement to and not a substitute for any other pre-litigation dispute resolution processes available by law to the city or the applicant. Completion of the zoning relief procedures shall evidence the exhaustion of all administrative remedies available from the city. 
(7)  Effect while pending . While an application for zoning relief or appeal of a determination of same is pending before the city, the city will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the applicant, except that the city may seek injunctive relief if an imminent threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public is present.
