PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fayetteville, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Grace Tavel, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Joe Morton, City Manager, and Judy Stephens, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Fayetteville readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-311. - Objectives and purchasing principles. 
(a)  Objectives. 
(1)  To conduct city business in such an open manner that potential vendors will be impressed by the fairness of the system and thus be encouraged to furnish competition which will ensure that the city will secure the best product at the lowest price at all times. 
(2)  To encourage competitive purchasing. 
(3)  To develop and maintain an adequate supply of materials, services and supplies as required. 
(4)  To give due consideration to ethical and quality standards and also to real value rather than price alone. 
(5)  To establish and build good relations with suppliers and departments. 
(6)  To discourage, as far as possible, any procedure other than that of competitive purchasing. 
(7)  To purchase the highest quality in supplies, equipment and contractual services at the least expense. 
(8)  To encourage cooperative/collaborative purchasing with other governmental agencies. This process provides discounting through combining the "purchasing power" of local entities to achieve economics of scale associated with this type relationship. 
(b)  Purchasing principles. The following principles are to apply to the procurement of materials, services and supplies: 
(1)  Materials, services and supplies are to be purchased only when monies for their cost have been appropriated in the annual budget for the city. 
(2)  Materials, supplies and equipment should be purchased by D.O.A.S. or under state contract when most cost effective. 
(3)  Materials, services and supplies not available through State of Georgia, D.O.A.S. or under state contract are to be purchased according to the procedures in section 2-314. 
(4)  All other considerations being equal, bids shall be awarded on price, service and delivery. Bid items must meet specifications in all cases to qualify. The city has the right to accept or reject any and all bids as long as that right is not exercised in violation of O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 91. 
(5)  Whenever possible long-term contracts should be obtained for supplying commodities such as gasoline or other items for which monthly or periodic requirements can be forecast. The purchasing department shall make periodic checks to assure that the party under contract is not escalating his delivery price beyond current market. 
(6)  Request for quotation, as well as sealed bids, should have a set time, date and location given by the purchasing department when tabulation of bids will be made and this shall be done at the time and date specified. 
(7)  Emergency purchases are the result of breakdown in equipment or other occurrences for which it is impossible to plan in advance. For emergency purchases of $5,000.00 or less: If the occasion arises during the hours of normal operation contact the purchasing agent and he/she may make the purchase or authorize the department head to do so. If an emergency arises after hours the department head will make the purchase and contact the purchasing agent the next working day and immediately send a memorandum explaining the emergency. Emergency purchases exceeding $5,000.00: Approval of the purchasing agent and city manager shall be obtained prior to any purchase.

The word "person" includes a firm, corporation, association, trust or partnership or other entity. The word city shall mean the City of Fayetteville, Georgia. 
(b)  Unless otherwise indicated, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed herein:

    Animated sign means any sign, or attention-getting device, with action, motion, changing colors, or having characteristics that require electrical or mechanical energy, including wind-activated elements such as spinners and aerial devices. 
    Area of sign. Only one face of a double-faced sign, as defined herein, bearing identical copy on each side shall be used in computing the area, otherwise both sides shall be used in computing area. 
(1)  Ground sign/monument sign. The area of a ground sign shall mean and shall be computed as the entire area within a continuous perimeter, enclosing the limits of all writing, representation, emblem, or any figure or similar character, together with any frame, other material, open space, or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate such sign from the background upon which it is placed. The supports or structure upon which any sign is supported shall be included in determining the sign area whenever such supports are designed in such a manner as to form an integral part of the display; however, provided that the area of the frame shall not be included in computing the area when the frame is composed of stone or brick and provided the frame contains or has attached no copy, words, writing, letters, or advertisement, but may not be internally illuminated, and provided that the surface area of the frame that is parallel to the display of the sign is no greater than 100 percent of the area of the sign displayed. A ground sign may include individual letters, numbers, figures, mounted on a surface composed of stone or brick or other permanent structures; called monument signs.

When a wall sign is formed by placing individual letters, numbers, or figures on the wall, without a distinguishing background, the area shall be determined by a contiguous perimeter drawn around all letters, numbers, figures, trademark, or other symbols, enclosing the limits of writing. Any letters, numbers, figures, trademarks, or graphics separated by 36 inches or more shall be considered two separate signs. 
(3)  Three dimensional sign. The area of a three dimensional sign shall be determined by a contiguous perimeter drawn around the three dimensional sign enclosing the limits of the three dimensional sign; said perimeter to be drawn around the vertical plane through the sign which creates the perimeter with the largest area. The three dimensional sign shall be treated as a double sided sign for purposes of sign area; therefore, the area of the above described perimeter shall be doubled, which product shall be the area of the sign for purposes of this sign ordinance. 
    Awning and canopy sign means a sign imposed or painted upon any roof-like structure that provides either permanent or temporary shelter for adjacent walkways or entrances to a building or property. Awning and canopy signs are prohibited, except see subsection 6-6(5), Main Street Historic District signs.

(Ord. No. 0-7-12, arts. I, II, 4-19-12; Ord. No. 0-03-16, art. 1 , 4-7-16; Ord. No. 0-17-18 , art. 1, 8-2-18) 
Sec. 6-3. - Purpose. 
    The mayor and council find that: 
(1)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly, and safely designed business environment. 
(2)  An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public. 
(3)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion, and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic controls signs, and devices. 
(4)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage, and that impedes the flow of information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians. 
(5)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth. 
(6)  Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well being of the City of Fayetteville will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
(7)  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The mayor and council intend by enacting this chapter to: 
a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
b.  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
c.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city; 
d.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
e.  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
f.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
g.  Promote economic development; and 
h.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(8)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other structures throughout the city. 
(9)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this chapter. 
(10)  The city council finds that there is a compelling state interest in the city and state being able to safely regulate the speed, direction and flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around public roads, streets and sidewalks, and quasi-public roads, streets and sidewalks in private property where the general public, invited by the owner, routinely and customarily to enters, transverses, and parks by vehicle and/or by foot. The city has a compelling state interest in the public safety and welfare of motorist and pedestrians in these areas, the safe and expedient access of public safety vehicles such as police, fire and rescue equipment to such areas. The city has a compelling state interest to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic such as to prevent or minimize collisions and the injury or death to persons caused thereby, or the damage to property, both public and private. Therefore, the city determines that there is a compelling state interest in the city's police chief regulating the type, traffic control message and placement of all traffic control signs and devices in the areas described above. The city also has a compelling state interest in insuring that private entities are not allowed to display in the areas described above, signs that imitate or emulate traffic instructional and control signs, devices or messages in such a way as may reasonably be mistaken by the public as true traffic control signs or devices, and thereby could reasonably be expected to cause a motorist or pedestrian to make an improper maneuver which will place the motorist or pedestrian or other motorist or pedestrian in danger of collision or injury due to such improper maneuver. Therefore, the city has a compelling state interest in regulating such signs in the areas described above which imitate or emulate a traffic instructional and control sign or device and which may reasonably be confusing to motorists or pedestrians in these areas.

(5)  Main Street Historic District signs. The purpose of the Main Street Historic District Sign Ordinance is to ensure the district's signage is harmonious in proportion, form, color, and materials to the character of the historic district. Visual relatedness is crucial to the goal of an integrated Main Street, and signs play a key role in helping to preserve the historical district's sense of time and place, and achieve the desired effect of charm and compatibility. The ordinance allows businesses to maintain their individual identities, and also become identified with the downtown historic district as a whole. To resolve the technical and aesthetic questions of signage, and encourage high quality in design, a Main Street Historic District Design Handbook containing appropriate sign/design examples is attached as Exhibit "A" to Ordinance No. 0-25-98, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
a.  Applicability. This section shall apply only to those building structures and uses within the geographical boundaries of the Main Street Architectural Overlay District, as established and defined in section 94-186 of the city's zoning ordinance. 
b.  Compatibility. As to signs, buildings, structures, and uses within the Main Street Architectural Overlay District, when a provision of this section conflicts with any section in the balance of chapter 6 of the Code, the provision of this section shall control. Otherwise, to the extent reasonably possible, the provisions of this section shall be interpreted consistent with the provisions of the balance of chapter 6 of this Code. 
c.  Signage standards. 
(1)  General. Signage shall complement the architectural details of the building, and shall not violate or otherwise obscure the architecture of the building to which it is attached. Signs, lettering, or boxed graphics shall not cut across columns, cornices, windowsills, arches or balconies, nor extend above the roofline of any building to which it is attached. 
(2)  Lettering, size, and construction. Letters can be painted or mounted directly on a signboard, storefront, wall or window, if in proportion to the storefront. Lots in the Main Street Architectural Overlay District are allowed the same amount of signage as lots outside of the Main Street District. Inside the Main Street District businesses may also utilize canopy signs, hanging or suspended signs, menu signs and sandwich signs. Acceptable lettering materials include wood, stone, synthetic stone, metal, vinyl, dimensional plastic, acrylic, or high-density polystyrene foam. The overall design of all signage shall be compatible with the turn-of-the-century theme. The typeset or lettering used shall be taken from, or compatible with, the typeset choices listed in the Typeset and Color Guide for Main Street Signage. Decorative borders and/or embellishments are encouraged. (See Main Street Historic Design Handbook for examples.) 
(3)  Materials. Signs may be constructed of concrete, brick, wood, stone, metal, glass, or synthetic materials that have the same appearance of the aforementioned natural materials due to their finish. All materials shall be compatible with the building's architecture, and should be colorfast and resistant to corrosion. Signs shall be professionally finished in accordance with the material selected, whether by sanding, painting, staining and/or sealing, with the edges of the sign framed out and/or sealed. 
(4)  Lighting. All signs in the historic district, whether ground signs or wall signs, shall only be illuminated by an external light source, and through craftsmanship and materials, shall reflect downtown district design aesthetics. (See Main Street Historic Design Handbook for examples.) 
(5)  Colors. Signs, and all lettering, symbols, and embellishments contained therein, shall be furnished in colors either contained in or consistent with the Typeset and Color Guide for Main Street Signage or from any commercially available historic color palette. 
(6)  Awnings and canopies. Decorative awnings or canopies over doors or windows are permitted in the Main Street area, and shall not be calculated as part of total signage area. Professionally applied lettering or symbols may be incorporated into the awning or canopy valance/drop flap, but are restricted to 20 percent of the awning field. Awnings or canopies shall clear sidewalks by seven feet in height, and project no more than six feet from the building. Canvas or synthetic look-alike canvas, is the only material permitted for decorative awnings and canopies. Metal or vinyl may be approved for functional awnings or canopies if the overall design is consistent with Main Street's turn-of-the-century theme. Awnings/canopies may not be backlit. 
(7)  Hanging or suspended signs. Hanging, suspended, or projecting signs are permitted in the historic area, and shall clear sidewalks by seven feet in height, and project no more than 36 inches from the building. Hanging or suspended signs should project from the wall at a 90-degree angle. Hanging or suspending signs over driveways, alleys, or parking areas is prohibited. Hanging, suspended, or projecting signs shall be limited to a maximum size of six square feet, and if double-sided, shall be calculated as only one sign. One hanging, suspended, or projecting sign per business street frontage is permitted, and shall be calculated as part of the total signage area allowed under section 6-6. Attractive hardware for hanging is encouraged. (See Main Street Historic Design Handbook for examples.) 
(8)  Sandwich board signs (a.k.a. A-frame signs). Movable sandwich signs, or A-frame signs, may be used in the historic district one per building or unit. A sandwich board sign shall have a maximum height of four feet, and a maximum area of eight square feet on one side, and through design, paint, lettering, and materials, shall conform to Main Street Historic District aesthetic standards. Sandwich board signs shall not be placed off-site or displayed in such a way as to block or hinder pedestrian traffic. Sandwich board signs may be placed upon public sidewalks, but must leave a minimum of five feet width of sidewalks clear of obstructions for pedestrian traffic. Each building or unit at its main public entrance, used exclusively by said building or unit shall be permitted one sandwich board sign. The sandwich board sign must be placed only on the sidewalk in front of said building or unit or in the front yard of the building or unit. Such signs must be placed in front of the building or unit within 20 feet of the main public entrance of said building or unit. Sandwich board signs shall not be included within the overall amount of signage allowed. 
(9)  Display box. A sign located within ten feet of the main public entrance used exclusively by the relevant building or unit as part of the total signage allowed. A display box shall have a clear face to protect the sign from the weather and be constructed to coordinate with the building design.

(1)  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area; 
(2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties in the city; 
(3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant significant privileges which are denied to other similar properties in the city; 
(4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare; 
(5)  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning districts involved; 
(6)  The cause for the need for the variance is not created by the applicant, the owner, lessor, or successor in ownership or occupancy; 
(7)  Signs may be displaced upon the vertical surface of a canopy only by a variance, upon the applicant reducing the number or square footage of ground or wall signs authorized by this chapter for the lot in question, so as to reasonably set-off for the additional signs. 
(b)  All requests for such variances shall be in written form and filed with the city manager. The city manager shall make a decision on a complete application within 30 days of the city manager's receipt of the application and shall mail the decision to the applicant at the address shown on the application. The writing shall state the basis of the decision. An applicant dissatisfied with the city manager's decision shall appeal to the city council pursuant to the appeal procedure at subsection 6-5(g). 
(c)  No change may be made in the location, shape, color, height, size, copy or text of any sign subject to a variance unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter and a sign permit is granted. 
(d)  A change in the owner, lessor, lessee, or user of property served by a sign subject to a variance shall negate the variance, and the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter and a new sign permit granted. 
(e)  A sign subject to a variance may not be reconstructed, replaced or reset if it is removed for any reason. 
(f)  When a sign under a variance has been razed or damaged by any cause, naturally occurring or otherwise, the sign shall not be re-established: 
(1)  If the value of the sign as damaged is 50 percent or less of the value of the signs prior to the damage; or 
(2)  If the estimated cost of repairing the above ground portion of the sign is more than the value of the sign in its damaged condition. 
(3)  Value shall be established by the city manager or his/her designee and shall be based upon the value of the sign's materials above ground with no allowance for the intrinsic value of the sign or the value of the right to have a sign at that location.

ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

Sec. 10-146. - Findings; public purpose. 
    Based on the experience of other urban counties and Municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; Amarillo and Beaumont, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, California; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas; which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Fayetteville, it is the finding of the council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcohol beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
(2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in paragraph (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of or acts which simulate any of the following: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual act, which is prohibited by law. 
b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals. 
c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
d.  Provided, however, that random acts of patrons or employees, whose actions do not constitute actions taken pursuant to encouragement or acquiescence of the management of the establishment and are not for the purposes of entertainment, promotion, publicity, or notoriety for the establishment shall not constitute the forms of behavior regulated by this article; provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed to make legal any conduct that may otherwise be prohibited by law. 
(3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above.

Sec. 22-181. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  It is the purpose and intent of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Fayetteville and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent any deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the ordinance [from which this article derives] to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  This article is not intended to interfere with or suppress legitimate expression or any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States constitution nor is it intended to license any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited or made punishable by law. 
(c)  Findings and rationale. Based upon evidence of the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses presented to, and made available to the mayor and city council in reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to:

 Report of City of Fayetteville Chief of Police Steven D. Heaton dated ______________, 2011; 
    The mayor and city council find: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
    The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the studies, opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

(h)  Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certified schedule of development impact fees for all categories of development or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim. 
(i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.

(2)  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements. 
(b)  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
(1)  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the Fayetteville Comprehensive Plan; 
(2)  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding; and, 
(3)  The city shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
(c)  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is allowed under a private contractual agreement executed under the provisions of this chapter. In the event that a developer enters into such a private contractual agreement with the city to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of the credit created is in excess of the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the development project, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from impact fees paid by other development located in the service area which is benefitted by such improvements. 
(d)  Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
(1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
(2)  For any dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
(3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the city would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
(4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
(5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the administrator in his sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
(e)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. a developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
(f)  The administrator, in his sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. a developer may appeal any such determination to the city council of the city, whose decision shall be final. 
(g)  Any credit shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
(h)  In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the city, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

(1)  Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or 
(2)  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected. 
(b)  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
(c)  When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in Fayetteville within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication. 
(d)  All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. Failure to make a claim for a refund within said time period shall result in a waiver of all claims to said funds. Such funds together with the accrued interest thereon shall be transferred to the general revenue account of the city. 
(e)  A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected. 
(f)  All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within 60 days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than 30 days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund. 
(g)  In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements.

(1)  The system improvements are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the Fayetteville Comprehensive Plan; and, 
(2)  The amount of any credit granted shall not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding. 
(b)  A private contractual agreement for system improvements may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the estimates of impact on public facilities according to the methods and provisions concerning the calculation of impact fees, provided that any such agreement shall allow the city to assess additional development impact fees after the completion of construction according to the fee schedule incorporated into this chapter as Attachment A (located at the end of this chapter). 
(2)  Permit construction of, dedication of property for, or other in-kind contribution for specific public facilities of the type for which development impact fees would be imposed in the same service area in lieu of or with a credit against applicable development impact fees. 
(3)  Permit a schedule and method of payment appropriate to particular and unique circumstances of a proposed project in lieu of the requirements for payment under this chapter, provided that acceptable security is posted ensuring payment of the development impact fees. Forms of security that may be acceptable include a cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit from a bank authorized to do business within the State of Georgia, a surety bond, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit or other development approval. 
(c)  Approval of a private contractual agreement under this section shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Any private agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the administrator for review, negotiation, and submission to the board of commissioners.

ARTICLE III. - TREE PRESERVATION AND LANDSCAPING[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, amended art. III of this chapter in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. III,  42-61-42-78, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 0-1-00,  I, adopted Jan. 17, 2000. 

Sec. 42-61. - Purpose. 
    In support and furtherance of its findings and determination that: 
(1)  Rampant growth and development in the region has resulted in the innumerable loss of trees. Tree roots hold soil in place and tree photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide to oxygen. Tree loss thus has contributed to dramatically increased soil erosion and sedimentation. High growth areas, where natural green spaces are diminishing, have left fewer trees to transform into oxygen the carbon dioxide of ever increasing, harmful vehicular and industrial emissions, resulting in severe air quality degradation; 
(2)  Integrated forest canopies reduce the costs of maintenance of other co-located parts of the urban infrastructure; 
(3)  Well managed urban forest resources increase in value and provide benefits to all citizens of the community with respect to air quality, water quality, stormwater management, temperature amelioration, community aesthetics and general quality of life; 
(4)  These benefits are crucial to the long term health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Fayetteville; 
(5)  The removal of forest canopy from urban areas of the state and its replacement with more intensive land uses exacts real costs upon the infrastructure which must be borne by all citizens of the community; 
(6)  Community forests function to the benefit of the local citizenry as a part of the public infrastructure as much as streets, utilities, stormwater management structures and sewers; 
(7)  Healthy community forests increase local commercial and residential property values; and 
(8)  A tree conservation and landscaping ordinance is one part of a dedicated and integrated planning process dealing with land use, impacts of impervious surface, urban hydrology and water quality, air quality, soil erosion, transportation, noise abatement, and responsible growth. 
    The city council hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this article to establish a uniform procedure for use in providing protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of places, districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects, and landscape features having a special historical, cultural, aesthetic interest and value, economic or environmental value, in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-62. - Intent. 
    It is the expressed intent of these tree protection standards that all site planning and design for development of land be undertaken with a survey of trees on the property and that the grading, final placement of buildings, structures, and roads, utilities, and other features minimizes the removal of existing trees, and insures their aesthetic distribution throughout the development on the property. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-63. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions of terms shall apply to this article: 
    Buffer: That portion of a lot set aside with adequate natural or planted vegetation to accomplish visual and sound screening to separate residential zoning districts from other zoning districts, or to protect environmentally sensitive areas. In the event that insufficient existing vegetation or trees exist in the buffer zone, planting, fencing, or other supplemental screening shall be required, with a density or opacity to accomplish buffering as required by all approved ordinances. Roads, parking areas, above ground stormwater retention facilities, recreational facilities, or other above ground construction shall not be permitted within the required buffer area. Public rights-of-way and utility easements shall not be considered part of the buffer area. Required buffer areas are in addition to required yard areas. 
    Caliper inches: The diameter or thickness of the main stem of a newly planted tree or sapling (in inches) as measured at least six inches above ground level. If the tree splits into multiple trunks below six inches, the diameter of the largest stem or trunk shall be used to measure the entire tree. 
    Clearing: An activity which removes or disturbs the vegetative cover, including trees. 
    Clear cutting: Silviculture practice which clears a site for replanting. 
    Critical root zone (CRZ): The total area contained within a circle that surrounds the trunk of a tree. The radius (measured from the trunk of the subject tree) of the circle shall be equal to 1.5 feet per caliper inch of the tree. For pines, the radius of the circle shall be equal to 0.5 foot per caliper inch of the tree. 
    Deciduous tree: Any tree which drops its leaves at the end of the growing season. 
    DBH: Diameter-at-breast-height is a standard of measure of existing tree size, and is the trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of 4.5 feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4.5 feet, then each trunk is measured and added together to determine DBH. A tree which splits into multiple trunks above 4.5 feet is measured as a single tree at 4.5 feet. 
    Deforestation: The cutting and/or removal of 40 percent or more of trees eight inches DBH and larger on the development site. 
    Disturbed area: Disturbed area is defined as the entire limits of the site project activity, outside of any undisturbed buffer area. Any area that will be graded, is classified as disturbed area. 
    Evergreen: Any tree which retains its green foliage throughout the year. 
    Farm and pasture land: Any land that has historically been used for agricultural purposes, other than silviculture, for more than ten years. 
    Land-disturbance activity: Any land change which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediment into state water or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, other than federal lands. 
    Land-disturbance permit: A permit issued to authorize clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. 
    Landscape areas: An area set aside for the installation and maintenance of native planting materials. 
    Landscaping: Any additions to the natural features of a plot of ground to restore construction disturbance and to make it more environmentally compatible, as by adding trees and shrubs, groundcover, etc., to the natural environment. Landscaping requirements shall not interfere with fire and life safety standards according to the development standards and other adopted ordinances and requirements, subject to public safety review. 
    Native species: Any tree species that originated in a particular place or region. For the purposes of this article, a tree species is considered to be native to the Fayetteville region if it is listed in Native Trees of Georgia, Georgia Forestry Commission, 1996 (as amended), and is considered indigenous to Plant Hardiness Zone II (the Piedmont Region) as shown in Landscape Plant Materials for Georgia, Bulletin 625, University Cooperative Extension Service, 1988 (as amended). 
    Natural vegetation: Natural vegetation shall mean a generally undisturbed, maintenance free, self-perpetuating stand of vegetation comprised of indigenous shrubs, flowers, ground cover, wild grasses, and trees. 
    Natural vegetation areas: The areas within the boundaries of a given lot which is devoted to natural vegetation. 
    Overstory trees: Canopy trees, either deciduous or evergreen, of greater height and spread than surrounding understory trees, which provide shade and protection to the earth and vegetation beneath it. 
    Project activity: Project activity is defined as buildings, roads, parking areas, stormwater management systems, etc. 
    Protection area: All land which falls outside the buildable area of a parcel, all areas of the parcel required to remain protected, the critical root zone of a tree or a cluster of trees to be retained, and/or all areas required as landscaping strips or buffers according to the provisions of the City of Fayetteville zoning ordinance and development standards, or conditions of zoning approval. 
    Shrub: A woody plant or bush of relatively low height (two through six feet), distinguished from a tree by having several stems rather than a single trunk. 
    Shrub density unit (SDU): A measurement of shrub density. Individual shrubs of three-gallon pot size (generally between 24 inches and 36 inches in height) count as one SDU. A project requiring a land-disturbance permit shall have a minimum ratio of 200 SDUs per disturbed acre. In order to promote variety in landscape design, 25 percent of the required SDUs may be from the ground cover list. 
    Specimen tree or stand: Any tree or grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value because of its species, size, age, location, or historic value. 
    Tree density units (TDU): A measurement for tree density. For existing trees designated to remain, total Existing TDUs = Sum of tree diameters (DBH) in inches. Replacement trees are measured in caliper inches, six inches above grade, and must be from section 42-75, Plant materials list. The amount of TDU credit for a replacement tree is determined by the trunk's diameter. Replacement trees may be no smaller than two caliper inches. Replacement trees from two caliper inches up to three caliper inches are worth 50 percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. Replacement trees from three-inch caliper to four-inch caliper are equal to the TDUs of an existing tree. Replacement trees four-inch caliper and larger are worth 150 percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. No more than 25 percent of the required TDUs may be grouped together on a site, without approval from the city. 
    Tree removal: The unauthorized intentional, or negligent killing, uprooting, removal or damaging of trees on a parcel of land. Such acts shall include but are not limited to damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree or trees, by the application of toxic substances, by the operation of equipment and vehicles, by storage of materials, by the change of natural grade due to unapproved excavation or filling, or by the unauthorized alteration of the soil or tree. 
    Understory tree: Any tree or woody plant which of lesser height and spread than surrounding evergreens or deciduous trees but which still provides shade and a degree of protection to the earth and vegetation beneath it.

Sec. 42-64. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to any and all activity within the City of Fayetteville (city) which requires a land-disturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit, and shall replace Ordinance 0-18-90 (landscape ordinance) and Ordinance 0-19-91 (tree protection ordinance). Projects located within the Highway Corridor Overlay District shall comply with all required landscaping standards, in addition to this article. Exemptions from this article are: 
(1)  Removal of dead, diseased, or infested trees, as determined by the Georgia Forestry Commission. Proof of a certified arborist's determination is required, in order to avoid penalties for tree removal. 
(2)  The operation and maintenance of orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operation. 
(3)  All property involved in a viable agricultural operation (establishment, cultivation, or harvesting of fields, and/or livestock operation). Commercial forestry operations are allowed, provided that valid forestry management plans have been submitted to, and accepted by the city. 
(4)  Any lot within a subdivision zoned for single family residential uses where the lot has been purchased from the developer and a house has been built. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-65. - Specimen tree. 
    [A specimen tree is] any tree or grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value because of its species, size, age, location, or historic value. General criteria for the determination of specimen trees are as follows: 
(1)  Any deciduous canopy tree whose DBH equals or exceeds 26 inches. 
(2)  Any evergreen canopy tree whose DBH equals or exceeds 22 inches. 
(3)  Any understory tree whose DBH equals or exceeds eight inches. 
(4)  Any dogwood, redbud or magnolia tree whose DBH equals or exceeds four inches. 
(5)  Any tree which has a significant historical value and can be documented through historical records, or otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-66. - Protected trees. 
(a)  No person shall cut, destroy, cause to be destroyed or remove any tree of eight inches DBH (25-inch circumference) or larger or any dogwood, redbud or magnolia tree with a trunk diameter of four inches DBH or larger in preparation for, anticipation of, or in conjunction with any development activity until such removal has been approved as part of the overall site development approval process of this article. The saving of existing trees less than the protected size is encouraged and may be utilized in some cases to meet the requirements for replacement of trees that are approved for removal. 
(b)  Deforestation on non-exempt properties is strictly prohibited. Any person, or entity who is responsible for the deforestation of a site shall be subject to the maximum penalties allowed under this article. Additionally, any site, which includes exempt and non-exempt properties, that has been deforested shall not be eligible to apply for a development permit, a building permit, rezoning, or annexation into the city for a period of 36 months from the date that the deforestation occurred. For purposes of this paragraph the last date of deforestation shall be the last day in which a forestry operation is conducted. The property owner who conducts a forestry operation within the city shall be required, within 30 days of the last day of deforestation, to deliver to the city manager a written notice setting forth the last date of deforestation and the identity and location of the property deforested. Upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city manager as provided above, the city engineer shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available to him/her, which estimated date shall not be rebutable. For purposes hereof forestry operation shall include, but is not limited to, the harvesting of 40 percent or more of the trees measuring eight inches dbh and larger on any property or development site. For purposes of this paragraph, the term site shall encompass and include any and all property within the city without regard to any possible exemption. 
(c)  The sites of trees that have been identified to be saved on a tree protection plan (see below) and are subsequently removed, must be replaced with an equal number of replacement TDU's. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-67. - Tree protection plan (TPP) required. 
(a)  A tree protection plan (TPP) must be submitted to the city engineer upon application for a land-disturbance permit. The TPP shall be combined with a preliminary plat, construction plans and/or site plans whenever possible. The TPP must be prepared by one or more of the following professional, registered in the State of Georgia: registered landscape architect, urban forester, arborist, land surveyor, or engineer. The TPP must include: 
(1)  The location of all trees with a trunk diameter of eight inches DBH and larger and all dogwoods, redbuds, and magnolias with a trunk diameter of four inches DBH and larger. For sites over ten acres in size, representative sample areas proposed by the owner's licensed engineers may be used to determine tree density. The sample areas shall be representative of the average total tree coverage of the site. When city staff questions the sample's fair representation of average total tree coverage, the city manager after consultation with the city's engineers shall determine the sample areas to be used. 
(2)  The species, location, DBH, and CRZ of all existing trees and specimen trees which will be retained to fulfill density requirements. Five or more trees whose CRZ combine into one tree protection area may be outlined as a group, with their size and species listed in a summary table. 
(3)  The species, location and DBH of all trees proposed to be removed. The city engineer may require additional information including, but not limited to, a certified arborist's appraisal of the trees viability and anticipated life span. A specimen tree may be removed if it is shown that at least one of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The location of the tree prevents the opening of necessary traffic lanes. 
b.  The location of the tree prevents access to the property, and that no alternative access exists. 
c.  The tree is dead, diseased, or dying to the point that repair or restoration is not practical, or the disease may be transmitted to other trees, as determined by a certified arborist, the director of planning and zoning, or his/her designee, or Georgia Forestry Commission. 
d.  The construction of utility lines necessary for the project cannot be installed via directional boring. 
(4)  The boundaries of all required buffer areas. 
(5)  The boundaries of all landscaped areas. 
(6)  The boundaries of all proposed buildings. 
(7)  The boundaries of all other impervious surfaces. 
(8)  The location, depth and height of all utilities. 
(b)  Upon submission of the TPP to the city engineer, a preliminary review will be made by the city engineer, or his/her designee. The TPP will either be approved, denied, or returned to the applicant with recommended changes, which must be made prior to the issuance of a land-disturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-68. - Site design. 
    All non-residentially zoned properties located outside of the Main Street district must maintain 40 percent of the site as green space. All non-residentially zoned properties inside the Main Street district must maintain 25 percent of the site as green space. Zoning districts which allow both residential and non-residential uses, are subject to the non-residential green space requirements. 
    While all types of trees are protected under these standards, special emphasis is placed on preservation of large trees and certain significant and more valued species listed herein. The highest site design priority shall be given to preservation of hardwood trees with a DBH of 26 inches or larger. Removal of these valued trees is highly discouraged, and will only be approved upon the determination of the planning and zoning commission that all responsible design alternatives have been explored by the applicant and removal cannot be avoided. 
    The placement of grade changes and building pads shall respect existing significant trees. Under no circumstance shall a grade change be allowed to intrude upon the CRZ of a retained tree. For development sites that do not contain any or very few of these significant trees, design emphasis should be shifted to preserving other species present. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-69. - Tree and shrub density requirements. 
(a)  Property subject to this article shall have, as a condition of approval, a minimum average tree density of 100 TDUs per acre of disturbed area. Disturbed area is defined as the entire limits of the site project activity (buildings, roads, parking areas, stormwater management systems, etc.) outside of the buffer area. Existing trees, which will be retained, will be given credit toward this requirement at the rate of one TDU per caliper inch DBH. Replacement trees will be given credit toward this requirement using a trunk measurement which is no less than six inches from the ground, at rate of one TDU per two inches of trunk diameter. Replacement trees from two-inch caliper up to three-inch caliper are worth 50 percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. Replacement trees from three-inch caliper to four-inch caliper are equal to the TDUs of an existing tree. Replacement trees four-inch caliper and over are worth 150 percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. Under no circumstances will the density be less than 100 or greater than 200 TDUs per acre of disturbed area. Tree density units per disturbed acre are in addition to any natural, undisturbed, watershed protection buffers or other environmental buffers required for development. 
(b)  For non-residential properties which have been historically used for farm and pasture land, replacement trees between two-inch caliper and four-inch caliper are equal to the TDUs of an existing tree. Replacement trees four-inch caliper and over are worth 150 percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. 
(c)  Residential lots being developed, shall have proportional share of 100 TDUs per acre, post development, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right of way, and spaced 80 to 100 feet apart. Example: 
One acre lots shall have 100 TDUs; 
Three-quarter acre lots shall have 75 TDUs; 
One-third acre lots shall have 33 TDUs; 
One-quarter acre lots shall have 25 TDUs; 
Less than one-quarter acre lots shall have TDUs at the same proportions as above. 
(d)  Residential lots, being developed on properties which have been historically used for farm and pasture land, shall have proportional share of 50 TDUs per acre, post development, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right-of-way, and spaced 80 to 100 feet apart. Example: 
One acre lots shall have 50 TDUs; 
Three-quarter acre lots shall have 37.5 TDUs; 
One-third acre lots shall have 16.5 TDUs; 
One-quarter acre lots shall have 12.5 TDUs; 
Less than one-quarter acre lots shall have TDUs at the same proportions as above. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-70. - Shrub density requirements. 
(a)  Property subject to this article shall have, as a condition of approval, a minimum average shrub density of 200 SDUs per acre. All SDUs to be planted must be located outside any natural, 
(b)  In order to encourage the protection of trees above and beyond the required 100 TDUs, shrub density requirements may be reduced by a similar area covered by the CRZ of the additional trees to be saved. 
(c)  As a healthy shrub eventually covers an area with a five-foot diameter, or 19.6 square feet, the required SDUs may be reduced by that area equal to 19.6 square feet, or multiples thereof. For example, should a development save 110 caliper inches of existing tree stock, per acre, the applicant would receive credit for the additional ten inches. This could be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Determine the critical root zone (CRZ) of the tree to be saved (a ten-inch tree would yield a 15-foot CRZ). 
(2)  Square the CRZ (225 square feet). 
(3)  Multiply the product of Step 2 by 3.14 (;pi;). This determines the healthy growing area of the tree to be saved, or 706.5 square feet. 
(4)  Divide the result of Step 3 by 19.6 = 36 SDUs. 
(5)  The number derived in Step 4 is the allowable reduction in SDUs. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-71. - Highway buffer. 
(a)  A landscaped buffer shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along the State Highways 85, 54, 92, 314 and Jimmie Mayfield Corridor Overlay District, as delineated at section 94-202 of the City of Fayetteville Code of Ordinances, highway right-of-way. The highway buffer is included in the 100 TDU and 200 SDU per acre requirements. 
(b)  For existing lots of record with a total depth from the right-of-way lines less than 500 feet, the depth of the highway buffer will be measured at ten percent of the depth of the lot. For each 50-foot decrease from the 500-foot measure, landscaping will be required according to the following table per every 100 feet of lot width: 
Depth of Lot Buffer Depth TDUs required 
per 100 linear feet SDUs required 
per 100 linear feet Area of Buffer 500 50 26 30 50,000 450 45 26 30 45,000 400 40 24 28 40,000 350 35 22 26 35,000 300 30 20 24 30,000 250 25 18 22 25,000  
(c)  For lots that measure between the 50-foot increments, the number closest to the lot depth shall apply (i.e., a depth measuring 285 feet would be required to plant additional vegetation. 
(d)  If an existing lot measures less than 250 feet in depth, the minimum depth of the highway buffer shall be 25 feet. 
(e)  This sliding scale provision for the highway buffer does not apply to any lot with a depth greater than 500 feet, which would be required to provide for the 50-foot buffer. 
(f)  If due to site constraints and location of existing vegetation, the number of total required landscaping materials cannot be reasonably placed within the highway buffer, the individual plant materials are still required but may be placed elsewhere along the side buffers, rear buffer or within the parking medians. The planning and zoning commission shall have discretion over the alternate placing of materials. 
(g)  The buffer shall contain only vegetative landscaping materials, except for the uses listed below: 
(1)  Vehicular access drives placed approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way; 
(2)  Foot and bicycle paths; 
(3)  Walls and fences less than six feet in height; 
(4)  Landscaping sculpture, lighting fixtures, trellises and arbors; 
(5)  Signage; 
(6)  Water, sanitary sewer, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable and other service lines provided that they are placed approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way. Where existing lines or planned lines must run parallel to the right-of-way, an equivalent amount of buffer may be required beyond the 50 feet if the character of the buffer is greatly disturbed. To the extent possible, such service lines should be consolidated with vehicular access routes. 
(7)  Electrical, telephone, gas, water supply, sewage disposal and other utilities may be constructed within the required buffer area. After installation of such services and to meet the requirements of this section 42-71, the developer shall be required to restore the buffer area as approved by the city. 
(8)  Drainage and stormwater detention areas. Where existing or created ponds and drainage swales will occupy a substantial portion of the highway buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patters, additional buffer depth may be required to achieve the visual softening intent of this section 42-71. 
(h)  No tree six inches in diameter at four feet dbh (diameter breast height) or larger may be removed from the highway buffer except for access drives, sight triangles, and dead or diseased trees as approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(i)  Landscaping. The purpose of this section is to protect and enhance any existing tree canopy, understory trees and shrubbery coverage in order to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots visible from the highway. It is also the purpose of this section to screen headlight glare on and off site and to mitigate commercial lighting as seen by neighboring properties and from the highway. Natural appearing landscape forms are encouraged. 
(1)  The plant materials designated in this article shall be generally distributed along and throughout the buffer in order that there not be significant gaps without plantings (except as required at sight triangles and road intersections). 
(2)  No more than one in three overstory trees shall be pine or cone-bearing. 
(3)  Existing, as well as installed, vegetation may be included in meeting the requirement, but if there is not sufficient distribution within the buffer, then additional plantings will be required at the discretion of the planning and zoning commission. 
(4)  Existing evergreen or deciduous understory trees may be counted for credit to meet the requirements. 
(5)  Size, caliper, and height of trees, shrubs or plants shall meet requirements of city's general landscape ordinance. 
(6)  Trees and shrubs shall not be pruned in any manner that would significantly diminish the desired softening character of the buffer except in accordance with standard horticultural practice. Trees shall not be limbed-up from the ground more than six feet to the lowest branches, except as required within sight triangles at intersections or to provide adequate light for understory plantings. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-72. - Other buffer and landscaping standards. 
(a)  Perimeter buffers. Unless otherwise required under section 94-315, landscaped buffers at least ten feet in width shall be maintained along the side and rear property boundaries. These buffers may be penetrated for vehicular and pedestrian passageways linking adjoining properties provided the passageways are placed approximately perpendicular to these buffers. 
(b)  Foundation buffers. A landscaped buffer at least eight feet wide shall be maintained between any structure and any parking or driving area, except for loading areas and areas where drive-through facilities are utilized. This space is to be reserved for plant material, either existing or planned. Sidewalks and handicap ramps may be placed adjacent to the buffer on either side. The buffer may be penetrated to provide for access to the building. 
(c)  Opaque walls and fences. Any opaque or partially opaque walls or fences installed along the front of the property, including those used for screening of parking areas, must be softened with landscaping materials. 
(d)  Frontage roads. Frontage roads shall be located behind the front buffer. 
(e)  Parking lot requirements. Parking lots shall include landscaped strips and landscaped islands as follows: 
(1)  Landscaped strip: As required by city Code section 94-361(5)c.2. Shrubs and/or trees shall be installed in the landscaped strip to provide for semi-continuous planting along the landscaped strip. Shrubs shall be at least one foot in height at installation and reasonably projected to grow at least two feet in height within three years. 
(2)  Landscaped island: As required by city Code section 94-361(5)c.1. Each landscaped island shall contain one broad-leaved overstory tree with a minimum size of two caliper inches at dbh and a minimum height of ten feet. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-73. - Tree protection requirements. 
(a)  Tree protection best management practices (BMPs) will be mandatory to insure the survival of existing trees and stands of trees during and after construction. Sometimes, it is more feasible to save stands of trees than it is to save single trees which are scattered throughout a site. A tree protection area shall be maintained around all trees and stands of trees to be retained. In most cases, this tree protection area is the same as the critical root zone (CRZ). In some instances, a larger area may have to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the Georgia Forestry Commission, or the city engineer. The tree protection area shall be marked with standard tree protection fencing (orange) as well as with "Tree Protection Area" signs attached to the tree protection fencing stakes. 
(b)  The construction and grading process can cause damages such as direct physical root damage, indirect root damage, and trunk/crown damage. Due to this, no land-disturbance, construction process, or storage of equipment or materials will be allowed to take place within the tree protection area, and the following will be adhered to: 
(1)  All individual trees to be retained must be marked with orange engineering tape tied around the trunk of the tree at a height of five feet above the pre-development grade. 
(2)  The tree protection area (CRZ) of individual trees and stands of trees will be marked with standard tree protection fencing (orange). At least two "Tree Protection Area" signs (two square feet each) shall be posted at each individual tree protection area. At least four "Tree Protection Area" signs shall be posted at stand of trees to be protected. Signs shall not be nailed or affixed to trees, but shall be attached to stakes supporting the tree protection fencing. 
(3)  No person engaged in the construction of any structure(s) or improvement(s) or any activity shall encroach or place solvents, material, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six feet of the area outside the critical root zone as defined herein, or any existing significant tree within a tree save area or buffer zone. 
(4)  During subdivision street construction, land-disturbance allowed by a development permit, shall be limited to areas needed for street right-of-way (r-o-w), drainage easements, and utilities. All other areas will be considered tree protection areas. If utilities must be routed through a tree protection area, and as a result, encroach upon the CRZ of any tree to be saved, the utility must be tunneled (by directional bore technique) at a minimum depth of 24 inches. 
(5)  The tree protection area should be maintained in a naturally vegetated state. The clearing of invasive non-native plant materials, such as kudzu, shall be allowed. 
(6)  Structures shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the CRZ. 
(7)  Roads and paved areas shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the CRZ plus ten feet, without consent of the city. 
(8)  If irreparable damage has occurred to a tree or trees within a tree protection area, as determined by the city engineer, or the Georgia Forestry Commission, it shall be the responsibility of the developer/builder to remove and replace tree or trees with an equal number of replacement TDU's as the damaged tree(s), and to guarantee survival of the tree or trees, after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-74. - Tree replacement requirements. 
    In some cases, tree replacement will be necessary to fulfill the tree density requirement. The following are guidelines for tree replacement to be followed after the construction process: 
(1)  All trees selected for replacement must be quality specimens free of disease, injury, or infestation, and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing area, and planted in accordance with standards established by the International Society of Arboriculture. 
(2)  All new trees planted to fulfill the tree density requirements must be in place prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(3)  New trees planted under the requirements of this article which do not survive for 24 months after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, will be replaced as a condition of occupancy. Trees shall be bonded via a maintenance agreement. Bonds will be released after the 24-month period has passed, and the health of the trees has been certified and accepted by the city. 
(4)  Replacement overstory trees shall not be planted within 20 feet of any structure, or within ten feet of any paved area. Replacement understory trees shall not be planted within ten feet of any structure, or within five feet of any paved area. 
(5)  Landscape islands and peninsulas in non-residential and institutional parking areas must contain sufficient pervious surface area to accommodate the appropriate replacement tree, in order to insure its longevity, and shall be irrigated. 
(6)  At least 75 percent of the replacement trees must be native trees as indicated in the list of suitable replacement trees. 
(7)  The minimum diameter for replacement trees shall be two inches as measured six inches above grade. 
(8)  Vegetation shall be at least five feet from fire hydrants, and shall be maintained as such. 
(9)  Residential lots shall have proportional share of TDUs per acre, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right-of-way, and spaced 80 to 100 feet apart. Example: 
One acre lots shall have 100 TDUs; 
Three-quarter acre lots shall have 75 TDUs; 
One-third acre lots shall have 33 TDUs; 
One-quarter acre lots shall have 25 TDUs; 
Less than one-quarter acre lots shall have TDUs at the same proportions as above. 
Residential lots, developed on properties which have been historically used for farm and pasture land, shall have proportional share of 50 TDUs per acre, post development, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right-of-way, and spaced 80 to 100 feet apart. Example: 
One acre lots shall have 50 TDUs; 
Three-quarter acre lots shall have 37.5 TDUs; 
One-third acre lots shall have 16.5 TDUs; 
One-quarter acre lots shall have 12.5 TDUs; 
Less than one-quarter acre lots shall have TDUs at the same proportions as above. 
(10)  In order to prevent a mono-crop urban forest, which can be prone to disease, no more than 50 percent of the replacement trees may be of one species. The remaining replacement tree stock must be made up of two additional species. 
(11)  Where minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, or redevelopment status, and not site design or size of the property, the developer/builder may seek permission from the planning director to donate to the City of Fayetteville landscaping and reforestation fund to compensate for not meeting the requirements of the landscaping ordinance. See section 42-81, Landscaping and reforestation fund, for guidelines.

Sec. 42-78. - Bonding. 
    In order to insure the survival of required replacement trees and shrubs, said plant materials may, at the discretion of the director of planning and zoning, be bonded under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Seasonal planting bond. When the time of year is inappropriate for installation of required plant materials, a seasonal planting bond may be utilized for a period of up to six months. This bond allows a project to receive a certificate of occupancy once all other requirements have been met. The seasonal planting bond shall be equal to 100 percent of the total cost of materials and installation, and will be released upon final inspection and compliance with the approved landscaping plan. Seasonal planting bonds shall be in the form of cash, check, money order, or letter of credit. 
(2)  Landscape survival bond. All projects that require replacement plant materials shall be required to submit a landscape survival bond, which shall be valid for a period of 24 months from the date of the certificate of occupancy. This bond allows for the replacement of plant materials that fail within the 24-month period. The landscape survival bond shall be equal to 100 percent of the total cost of materials and installation for the first 12 months, and shall be reduced to 50 percent of the total cost of materials and installation for the remainder of the bond period. The landscape survival bond will be released at the end of the 24-month period. Landscape survival bonds shall be in the form of cash, check, money order, or letter of credit. If cash, check, or money order are utilized to secure a bond, the funds will be placed in an interest bearing escrow account.

Sec. 42-79. - Penalties. 
    The city has the authority to levy both civil and administrative penalties for violations of this article. 
(1)  Civil penalty. Violation of this article constitutes a misdemeanor offense, and is punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per offense. The minimum fine for unauthorized removal of a protected tree is $750.00. In situations of deforestation, or where attempts have been made to remove evidence of a tree (stump removal, etc.), the maximum fine shall be levied. For the purpose of enforcement, each tree removed shall be treated as a separate offense. Each violation of this article will constitute a separate offense. 
(2)  Administrative penalty. In the event that protected trees and natural vegetation on a site are damaged or destroyed during the development of said site, the city may choose to render an administrative penalty against the developer. 
Course of action for administrative penalty: 
a.  The building inspections department shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
b.  The planning director, or designee, shall review the damage and determine the resulting effect upon the approved landscape plan, the site, adjoining properties, and the city in general. 
c.  A moratorium may be placed upon the development. Based upon the severity of the actions, the moratorium will last for a period of up to six months, at the discretion of the city manager. 
d.  Upon request, the developer shall submit a revised tree protection and landscaping plan for review and approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
e.  Once the moratorium has been lifted, the revised tree protection and landscaping plan must be adhered to, in order to avoid further penalty.

(Ord. No. 0-33-04,  1, 2, 10-21-04) 
Sec. 42-81. - Landscaping and reforestation fund. 
(a)  One of the goals and purposes of the landscaping ordinance is to have each development site offset the impact on the environment of such development by means of providing the required landscaping and pervious surface on the site where such impact occurs. Where minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints or pre-existing development, and not site design or size of the property, the developer/builder may seek permission to donate to the City of Fayetteville landscaping and reforestation fund to compensate for not meeting the requirements of the landscaping ordinance. Unless a variance has been granted by the planning and zoning commission to reduce the size of a buffer, there is no relief from the required landscaping in all buffer zones. Contribution to the landscaping and reforestation fund must be authorized by the planning director and is contingent upon meeting the following criteria: 
(1)  Natural site constraints and/or pre-existing development prevent the planting of required trees and not development design or the size of the property. 
(2)  A maximum of 50 percent of required TDUs for a development can be compensated for. 
(3)  Regardless of pre-existing development or variance status, impervious surface of a candidate site outside of the Main Street Architectural Overlay District may not exceed 75 percent. Regardless of pre-existing development or variance status, impervious surface of a candidate site inside the Main Street Architectural Overlay District may not exceed 85 percent impervious surface. For purposes of this section 42-81, pervious pavers, meeting the requirements of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual section 3.3.8 for Modular Porous Paver Systems, will be given credit from impervious surface calculations. Pervious paver systems shall be considered 50 percent pervious and 50 percent impervious for purposes of the calculations. Pervious pavers shall be allowed for use on 25 percent of the parking spaces in a parking lot. Pervious pavers are not allowed for use as driveways, or where traffic volumes are high or where heavy duty pavement is needed. 
(b)  Authorization process. To receive authorization, a submittal must be made that includes a completed landscaping and reforestation contribution form and the landscaping plan for the site. Review will be conducted within 30 days. 
    If approved, donation is to be collected at the time of a mutually established date between the planning director and the applicant. 
(c)  Landscaping and reforestation fund contribution form. 
(1)  The landscaping and reforestation fund contribution form must be completed and submitted along with other required materials to the planning director for review. 
(2)  The form shall include the following information: 
Project name, project description, project address, contact name, company name, telephone number, fax number, email address, date of planning and zoning commission development plan approval, conditions of approval, reason for which contribution is necessary, amount of contribution, all contribution calculations and requirements, acres of site, impervious surface calculation, required TDU's, TDU's to be contributed for, area of impervious surface (in square feet) above 60 percent or 75 percent on sites within the Main Street District, supporting documentation list, director of planning and zoning recommendation and signature, city manager signature, and the date the check is to be received. 
(3)  The submission must also include the following: 
a.  Tree protection and landscaping plan. 
b.  Any supporting documents requested by the planning and zoning department. 
(d)  Assessing cost. In order to compensate for the lack of required landscaping on a given site, land must be obtained by the city, dedicated to open space, planted with the balance of required TDU's, and maintained. In addition, a fixed fee for administrative and consultation services will be incurred. The total cost will be assessed as follows: 
(1)  Trees. 
a.  To calculate the cost required for the required TDU's which are lacking from the site, the following rules shall apply. Three different tree types must be used with no more than 50 percent of the trees being of the same species. The provided trees are given credit for each caliper inch at a rate of 50 percent per required TDU. Price quotes from three different landscapers shall be averaged to determine the total cost for the following: 
1.  Cost of each tree. 
2.  Installation for all trees. 
3.  Maintenance cost per tree for two years. 
(2)  Administrative cost is $150.00. 
(3)  Any incurred consultation fees. 
(e)  Uses for fund. Donations to this fund serve to offset the lack of pervious surface and landscaping on the site for which a contribution was made. The planning director and his/her designee(s) will establish and assign priority to all projects for use of funds. In addition to providing landscaping, the city may also initiate and administer such projects that include, but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  Purchase land or easements where either specimen trees are located or where a suitable site exists for parkland or the planting of trees. 
(2)  Seek out local, state, federal, and private funds for the purpose of landscaping, reforestation, open space, and green space. 
(3)  Plant trees and increase landscaping on existing city owned property, including right-of-way as part of a streetscape project. 
(4)  Promote the observance of National Arbor Day. 
(5)  Further the awareness and the goals of the landscaping ordinance. 
(f)  Limitations. The fund cannot be used for the construction of recreational facilities.

(Ord. No. 0-7-17 , art. II, 4-6-17) 
Sec. 42-139. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 42-139(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 42-139(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A.  12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A.  12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; mulch or temporary grassing shall be applied to all exposed areas within 14 days of disturbance; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A.  12-7-1 et. seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 42-139(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970". And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer areas has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in to the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within the buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, stat of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of the Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 42-139(b) and 42-139(c) of this article:

(Ord. No. 0-7-17 , art. II, 4-6-17) 
Sec. 42-140. - Application and permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Fayetteville, Georgia, without first obtaining a permit from the City of Fayetteville to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 42-139(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 42-139(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  A local permitting fee, in the amount of $100.00 shall be charged by the city for each permit. In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 42-139(c)(15), (16) and (17) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 42-140(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. The local issuing authority shall provide the applicant notice that the bond or any part thereof is to be forfeited and may appeal pursuant to section 42-144 of this article. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 42-139(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A.  12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 42-139(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 42-140(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

Former  42-176-42-180 pertained to stormwater management generally and derived from Ord. No. 0-9-96,  10-60-10-63, 10-65, adopted March 18, 1996; Ord. No. 0-9-98,  1, 2, adopted Jan. 19, 1998; and Ord. No. 0-6-01,  1, 2, adopted Feb. 15, 2001. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
Subdivision I. - General Provisions 

Sec. 42-145. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this post development stormwater management ordinance ("division") is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

Sec. 42-185. - Design guidelines. 
    Minimum requirements to reduce pollutant discharges to the City of Fayetteville Drainage System from areas of new developments and/or re-development. 
(1)  Upon submitting an application for a land-disturbance permit in accordance with the City of Fayetteville Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance, section 42-136 et seq., a person(s) or entity(s) seeking approval from the City of Fayetteville to commence any development, or redevelopment, activities which direct stormwater runoff or other discharges to the City of Fayetteville Drainage System shall include with his/her/its application, plans prepared by a Georgia registered professional engineer intriplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the development vicinity; existing and proposed structures; existing and proposed drainage systems; and proposed activities on the site. Specifically, the following information is required to be shown on the plans: 
a.  A plan to reduce the discharge of pollutants to City of Fayetteville's Drainage System from the first 1.2 inches of stormwater runoff from areas of new development and redevelopment. In numerical terms, it is equivalent to a rainfall depth of 1.2 inches multiplied by the volumetric runoff coefficient (Rv) and the site area, and is calculated from the formula below: 
WQv = [(1.2) (Rv) (A)] / 12 
where: 
WQv is the water quality volume in acre-feet; 
Rv is [0.05 + 0.009(I)] where I is the percent impervious cover; and 
A is the site area in acres. 
A minimum WQv of 0.2 inches per acre shall be met at sites that have less than 17 percent impervious cover. 
For purposes of this section 42-185, pervious pavers, meeting the requirements of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual section 3.3.8 for Modular Porous Paver Systems, will be given credit from impervious surface calculations. Pervious paver systems shall be considered 50 percent pervious and 50 percent impervious for purposes of the calculations. Pervious pavers shall be allowed for use on 25 percent of the parking spaces in a parking lot. Pervious pavers are not allowed for use as driveways, or where traffic volumes are high or where heavy duty pavement is needed. 
This division follows the philosophy of removing pollutants to the "maximum extent practicable" through the use of a percentage removal performance goal. The approach to be taken is to treat the WQv to remove 80 percent of the annual total suspended solids (TSS) loading commonly found in urban stormwater runoff. 
b.  Plans should include, but are not limited to, structural, non-structural and/or source control measures to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff or other appropriate provisions as approved by the city manager. 
c.  Plans shall also address controls to reduce pollutants in discharges to the City of Fayetteville's Drainage System after construction is completed. 
d.  Plans should incorporate, as necessary, the design recommendations and criteria set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and/or the City of Fayetteville Water Quality Best Management Practices for Stormwater Management Guidance Manual. 
(2)  Applicants shall prepare, or shall have prepared, and submit to the City of Fayetteville Pond Certification Form, where applicable, to document the as-built condition of the stormwater management facility. The form shall be signed and sealed by a Georgia registered professional engineer.

ARTICLE VII. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

Sec. 42-201. - Title, findings and objectives. 
(a)  Title of ordinance. This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the City of Fayetteville, Georgia," ("this article" shall also mean "this article," and visa versa). 
(b)  Finding of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Fayetteville, Georgia, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the City of Fayetteville, Georgia relies on as a source of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
    Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

    Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
    Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
    Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
    Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
    Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

    Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city manager or his designee finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city manager of the City of Fayetteville may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided above, the city manager of the City of Fayetteville shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and city council. The City of Fayetteville shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Fayetteville. The City of Fayetteville shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land-disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

(Ord. No. 0-8-05, arts. 3, 4, 4-7-05) 
Sec. 42-320. - Responsibility. 
    Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this article shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the City of Fayetteville, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property.

(Ord. No. 0-9-08, art. II, 4-3-08) 
Sec. 54-5. - Standards for development. 
5.1.  Definition of Floodplain Boundaries. 
(1)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(2)  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Fayetteville. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Fayetteville, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Fayetteville. 
5.2.  Definition of Floodway Boundaries. 
(1)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Fayetteville. If floodway data is not available from the city manager or designee, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Fayetteville. 
5.3.  General Standards. 
(1)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
(a)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
(b)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
(c)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
(d)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(2)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
(a)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
(b)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
(c)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
(d)  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of this chapter; 
(e)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
(f)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Fayetteville using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
5.4.  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of this chapter apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Fayetteville prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Fayetteville. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
5.5.  Floodway Encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below. 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Fayetteville until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Fayetteville. 
5.6.  Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Fayetteville may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City of Fayetteville to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Fayetteville.

Sec. 54-7. - Variance procedures. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city manager or designee or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the city manager or designee. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city manager or designee. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city manager or designee shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council as established by the City of Fayetteville in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the appropriate court as provided in O.C.G.A.  5-4-1. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the city manager or designee and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The (administrator) shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city manager or designee and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city manager or designee and the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

(c)  That if, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable relevant codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this Code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
(3)  That, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(4)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

(b)  The purpose of this article is to regulate tattooing within the city limits of the City of Fayetteville and further to require that the same be done only by licensed physicians, to provide for a definition of tattooing, to provide for penalties for violation of this article, to provide for an effective date, to provide for the repeal of conflicting ordinances, and for further purposes.

Sec. 62-18. - Social hosting. 
(a)  Purpose . The city council desires to protect the health, safety and welfare of all persons living in and visiting the city. The use of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is prohibited by Georgia law and under the City of Fayetteville Code of Ordinances. This section prohibits and establishes penalties for any person hosting an event or gathering where alcohol is present and being possessed or consumed by persons under 21 years of age. 
(b)  Findings. The city council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council finds that: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(3)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(4)  An ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
(c)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings: 
(1)  Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, from whatever source or by whatever process produced. 
(2)  Alcoholic beverage means all alcohol, distilled spirits, beer, malt beverage, wine or fortified wine. 
(3)  Event or gathering means any group of three or more persons who have assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other activity. 
(4)  Host means to aid, conduct, allow, entertain, organize, supervise, control, or permit a gathering or event, whether that host is present or not. 
(5)  Parent means any person having legal custody of a juvenile: 
a.  As natural, adoptive parent, or step-parent; 
b.  As a legal guardian; or 
c.  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
(6)  Person means any individual, firm, partnership, cooperative, nonprofit membership corporation, joint venture, association, company, corporation, agency, syndicate, estate, trust, business, trust, receiver, fiduciary or other group or combination acting as a unit, body politic or political subdivision, whether public, private, or quasi-public, or any entity. 
(7)  Residence or premises means any home, land, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, or other dwelling unit, or a hall or meeting room, or any other place of assembly, public or private, whether occupied as a dwelling or for any social function, and whether owned, leased, or rented. 
(8)  Underage person is any individual under 21 years of age. 
(d)  Prohibited acts. 
(1)  It is unlawful for any person(s) to host or allow an event or gathering at any residence, premises, or on any other private or public property where the following occurs: 
a.  Alcohol or alcoholic beverages are present when the person knows or reasonably should know that an underage person will or does consume any alcohol or alcoholic beverage or possesses any alcohol or alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it; 
b.  The person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent possession or consumption by the underage person(s). 
(2)  A person is criminally responsible for violating section 62-18(d) of this section if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires with or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act. 
(e)  Exceptions. 
(1)  This section does not apply to conduct solely between an underage person and his or her parents while present in the parent's household. 
(2)  This section does not apply to legally protected religious observances. 
(3)  This section does not apply to alcoholic beverage licensees who are licensed by the City of Fayetteville and the State of Georgia. 
(4)  This section does not apply to situations where underage persons are lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcoholic beverages during the course and scope of employment.

Sec. 62-83. - Alarm registration and permit requirements. 
(a)  Registration and permit required. Effective April 1, 2012, no alarm system shall be used unless the alarm user first registers for such alarm system within seven days of its installation with the city or its designee. For the purposes of complying with this section, an alarm contractor may register an alarm user and thereby obtain the permit for such alarm system; provided, however, that the alarm user shall ultimately remain responsible for alarm registration prior to use of the alarm system. Upon registration, each alarm permit shall be assigned a permit number. If the permit number is issued directly to the alarm user, the user shall provide the permit number to the alarm contractor to facilitate law enforcement dispatch. 
(b)  Nontransferability; new registration required. Alarm registration is not transferable. Upon transfer of the possession of premises at which an alarm system is maintained, the new alarm user shall register his or her alarm system within seven days of the acquisition of the property or installation of a new alarm system. 
(c)  Multiple alarm systems. If an alarm user has one or more alarm systems protecting two or more separate structures with different addresses and/or tenants, a separate permit shall be required for each structure and/or tenant.

(3)  Upon obtaining a permit number, provide that number to the alarm contractor; 
(4)  Respond or cause a representative or other responsible party to respond to the alarm system's location within 30 minutes upon notification from the emergency communications center of the need to deactivate a malfunctioning alarm system; 
(5)  Ensure that an alarm is not manually activated by the alarm user or any other person for any reason other than an occurrence of an event that the alarm system was intended to report; 
(6)  Obtain a new permit if there is a change in address or ownership of a business or residence. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-12,  1, 2-2-12)

(2)  Maintain current contact information, including user permit numbers, which shall be provided to the emergency communications center at the time of a request for law enforcement response; and 
(3)  Upon request, provide to the emergency communications center the name, address, and telephone number of the license holder or a designee, who can be called in an emergency, 24 hours a day and who shall be able to respond to an alarm call, when notified, within 30 minutes. 
(b)  For all installations on or after April 1, 2010, an alarm contractor shall use only alarm control panel(s) which meets SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01. 
(c)  Prior to activation of any alarm system, the alarm contractor must (i) provide verbal and written instructions regarding the proper operation of the alarm system to the alarm user and (ii) provide written information on how to obtain service from the alarm contractor. 
(d)  An alarm contractor performing monitoring services shall: 
(1)  Attempt to verify, by calling the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting dispatch. Telephone verification shall require, at a minimum, that, if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user, the alarm contractor must make a second call to a different number in an effort to reach an alarm user who can provide proper identification and assist in determining whether an alarm signal is valid. 
a.  The failure of an alarm contractor, or any person or entity providing similar monitoring services, to attempt to verify the alarm signal will not negate the end user's responsibility for violations of Code section 62-86 and any penalty or fine associated therewith. 
b.  Such second call for verification shall not be required in the event of a panic or robbery-in-progress alarm or in cases where a crime-in-progress has been verified by video and/or audible means. 
(2)  Communicate any specific information that will assist law enforcement response and investigation to the emergency communications center at the time of a request for assistance.

When an alarm user has ten or more false alarms during the permit year or when the alarm user is 60 or more days delinquent on payment of any civil fine, a law enforcement response to the alarm user's permitted location will only be initiated in response to a 911 call to the emergency communications center or upon verification by the alarm contractor or user that the alarm was set off as a result of criminal activity. Routine alarm responses by FPD will be restored under the following circumstances: 
(1)  When a user files an appeal; and

(Ord. No. 0-1-12,  1, 2-2-12) 
Sec. 62-89. - Appeals. 
(a)  Appeals process. Assessments of civil penalties and other enforcement decisions made under this article may be appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the chief of police within ten days after the date of notification of the assessment of civil penalties or other enforcement decisions. The written notice of appeal shall contain the cause for the appeal and any other pertinent information relevant to the case. The failure to give notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the assessment of penalties or other enforcement decisions. The chief of police shall designate a hearing officer to hear the appeal. The hearing officer shall render a decision within five business days and give written notification of his/her decision. The hearing officer's decision may be appealed to the chief of police by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days of the decision of the hearing officer.

(Ord. No. 0-1-12,  1, 2-2-12) 
Sec. 62-91. - Immunity. 
    Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By registering an alarm system, the alarm user acknowledges that the response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES 

Sec. 78-186. - General principles of design. 
(a)  Detailed specifications and requirements for development within the city are contained in the Fayetteville development standards and in this article. Where any conflict exists between the development standards and this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall govern. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards noted herein and those contained in the zoning ordinance, building codes, or other ordinances of the city, county, or state, then the most restrictive shall apply. 
(b)  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or land that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health and safety and of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. 
(c)  The subdivider shall preserve all trees and other natural growth as required by city ordinance. 
(d)  Access to every subdivision and every lot within shall be provided over a public street. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
(e)  All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission. 
(1)  All highways, streets, and other features of the transportation plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the dimension indicated on the master plan. In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federally numbered highway, the approval of the Georgia State Highway Department may be required by the planning commission. 
(2)  Where features of the transportation plan (other than minor streets and collector streets) such as school sites, parks, arterial streets, major thoroughfares, and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the master plan and planning policy, but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be dedicated. The planning commission may waive these platting and reservation requirements whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release stating that such a planned feature is not required. 
(3)  Whenever the plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission or the appropriate agency finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land. 
(f)  The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of a plan and program for group development projects or neighborhood unit or planned unit development which is not divided into customary lots, blocks, and streets, which, in the judgment of the planning commission, provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, provided zoning density standards for the entire tract are not exceeded, and which also provides such covenants or other legal procedures as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission whether or not such plat is to be recorded and no building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. Normal review times may be extended to allow for thorough review and analysis of such development plans. 
(g)  Modifications of the provisions set forth in these rules and regulations may be authorized by the planning commission in specific cases when, in its opinion, undue hardships may result from strict compliance; provided any such determination shall be based fundamentally on the fact that unusual topographical and other exceptional conditions require such modifications, and that the granting of the modifications will not adversely affect the general public or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modification granted by the planning commission shall be made in writing to the subdivider and also made a part of the planning commission's records and the plat. Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the planning commission by the subdivider and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application. 
(h)  Permanent iron monuments (minimum one-half-inch rebar or three-fourths-inch pipe) at least by 16 inches long shall be accurately set and established at all corners of each lot. The accurate location, material, and size of all existing monuments shall be indicated on the final plat. 
(Ord. No. 0-40-96,  500, 9-3-96) 
Sec. 78-187. - Street and right-of-way requirements. 
(a)  The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the transportation plan for the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(b)  Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(c)  Where a subdivision contains a dead-end street other than a cul-de-sac, the planning commission may require the subdivider to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way, when the planning commission considers such to be necessary for effective traffic circulation. 
(d)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, double-frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service drives, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(e)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(f)  The following street design standards shall be observed by the subdivider:

The planning commission is authorized to allow exceptions if conditions so justify at the time preliminary plat is submitted. 
(1)  Temporary culs-de-sac may be required where the land adjoins property not subdivided. 
(2)  If adjoining property contains a street that is terminated by a temporary cul-de-sac, the new subdivision plat may be required to provide for a continuation of this street on the property being developed. 
(o)  Dead-end streets shall be prohibited. 
(p)  The subdivider shall indicate on the subdivision plat the proposed name or number of all streets within the subdivision. Streets and roads that are obviously in alignment with and are extensions of existing previously named or numbered streets shall bear that name. The names of all new streets within the subdivision shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission. 
(q)  Curbs and gutters shall be installed on all streets, except where noted herein. Installation shall be in accordance with the development standards of the City of Fayetteville.

(a)  Block lengths and widths shall be as follows: 
(1)  In general, residential blocks shall not be greater than 1,800 feet in length, or less than 600 feet in length. In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the planning commission may, when existing or proposed public gathering places so justify, require public crosswalks with a right-of-way width of not less than ten feet across the block. 
(2)  The depth of residential blocks shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots, unless prohibited by natural or manmade barriers, or unless one tier backs on to a line of another person's property, provided that this shall not prevent the inclusion with the subdivision plan of blocks of greater width including super blocks. Super blocks may contain public or joint use areas such as parks and playgrounds and shall be covered by adequate maintenance agreements if not dedicated and accepted for public maintenance. 
(3)  Perimeter lots of greater than minimum depth may be required where abutting upon limited access highways or major thoroughfares, in order to provide adequate buffering. 
(b)  The following lot size requirements shall be met: 
(1)  Each lot shall abut upon a public street. 
(2)  Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
(3)  Every residential lot shall conform to the minimum dimension and area requirements of the zoning ordinance, provided that every lot not served by a public sewer or community sanitary sewage system and/or public water shall meet the dimension and area requirements of the health department. 
(4)  Double frontage, unless required by the planning commission, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography orientation, and property size. A planting screen reservation of at least ten feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. 
(5)  Lot remnants (lots below minimum area or width left over after subdividing tracts of land) shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
(6)  The subdividing of land adjacent to or surrounding an existing or proposed lake shall be such that lots abutting the lake shall not extend into the lake. Such requirements may be waived upon submittal to the planning commission of an acceptable method for the maintenance of the lake and any recreational operations to be provided thereon. Maintenance of the lake shall be provided by the developer or homeowners' association. 
(7)  Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the building front yard setback requirements for both abutting streets. 
(Ord. No. 0-40-96,  502, 9-3-96)

(c)  All surface water drainage shall be transported to existing storm sewers or to drainage facilities approved by the city engineer. 
(d)  Whenever drainage ditches are used, such ditches shall retain natural design characteristics and be so designed that they do not present a hazard to life and safety. 
(e)  When the construction of a proposed public road makes it necessary to cross a storm drain, the developer shall provide and install the required size and length of pipe acceptable to the city engineer. 
(1)  In cases where the developer or owner chooses not to develop the land through which the drain runs, then the trench may be left open, however, in such cases the plat must be so marked and an easement shown thereon, indicating that no building or driveway shall be built over or within 40 feet of the open drain. 
(2)  Where the developer chooses to leave the drain open and same is crossed by a driveway, the size of pipe shall be determined by the city engineer, and no building permit will be approved unless the installation meets the requirements of the city engineer. 
(f)  Improvements, such as widening, deepening, relocating, clearing, protecting, or otherwise improving existing lakes and shorelines, streambeds and other watercourses, for the control of mosquitoes and public health nuisance, shall be provided by the developer in accordance with standards and requirements of the health department. 
(g)  Any water impoundment structure shall be constructed so as to minimize mosquito breeding and other nuisance hazards.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, adopted Jan. 15, 2004, added new provisions to this chapter as art. II, div. 3. As other provisions existed within this chapter as art. II, div. 3, said provisions have been redesignated as art. II, div. 3.5 at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 86-100. - Establishment of a stormwater utility. 
(a)  The City of Fayetteville, Georgia (hereinafter referred to as the "city") hereby establishes a stormwater management utility (hereinafter referred to as the "utility") within the city which shall be responsible for creating revenue for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. The utility shall be under the operational direction of the City of Fayetteville city manager. The corporate limits of the city, as increased from time to time, shall constitute the boundaries of the utility's district. 
(b)  The city shall establish a water, sewer and stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility. all revenues and receipts of the utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the water, sewer and stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes of the utility, including, but not limited to operational actions, capital project construction, or payment of bonds funding capital projects. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04) 
Sec. 86-101. - Definitions. 
(a)  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the utility. This benefit includes, but is not limited to, the utility's management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties and the regulation of the public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities. 
(b)  Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
(c)  Hydrologic response . The hydrologic response of a parcel of property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from the property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
(d)  Impervious surface. Impervious surface is the area which prevents or impedes the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as the water would have infiltrated under natural conditions prior to the parcel's development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, swimming pools, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to the property's development. 
(e)  Stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion, and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Stormwater management systems address these issues through improving, maintaining, regulating and funding instrumentalities used in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
(f)  Undeveloped land . Land in its unaltered natural state or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface which impedes the infiltration of stormwater or causes stormwater to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural state by the creation or installation of less than 1,000 square feet of impervious surface. 
(g)  Residential dwelling property shall mean developed land containing one detached dwelling unit, including houses, manufactured homes and mobile homes on individual lots, and shall mean developed land containing attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes apartments, condominiums, townhouses or mobile home parks; where two or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas, such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or additions to the building which are used as offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar non-residential uses. Residential dwelling property shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home. 
(h)  Developed land is defined as all property altered from its natural state by the construction or installation of 1,000 or more square feet of impervious surface. 
(i)  Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) is defined as the median area of impervious surface established in residential dwelling properties in the city as determined by the city's consulting engineers, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to residential dwelling properties, and other developed properties. Three thousand eight hundred square feet of impervious surface shall be one equivalent runoff unit. 
(j)  Other developed properties includes, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, shopping and retail centers, public buildings and structures, gasoline stations, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private educational facilities, hospitals, convalescent centers, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes, assisted living homes, commercial uses, industrial uses, institutional uses and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. 
(k)  Service charges are defined as the periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters, which influence the utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious surface as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes or similarly-situated properties whose impact on the utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater services charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, the inspection of development projects, the inspection of on-site stormwater control systems and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the utility. 
(l)  Occupant is defined as the individual residing or conducting business on the property. In a family or household circumstance, the individual responsible for the obligation imposed by this article shall be the adult head of the household. In a commercial circumstance, the adult legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be responsible for the obligation imposed by this article. 
(m)  Owner is defined as the legal owner(s) of record as shown on the tax records of Fayette County except where there is a recorded land sale contract, the purchaser there under shall be deemed the owner. 
(n)  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. The occupant of any habitable property is deemed the user. If the property is not occupied, then the owner shall be deemed the user.

(a)  The city stormwater management system consists of all city streets, curbs and gutters, rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and public and private properties, and which are state or United States' waters, owned by the city or over which the city has an easement for stormwater control. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which (1) are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements and (2) the segments which are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
(b)  In consideration for the city allowing the utility to use the city's existing street, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and man-made within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters; the utility shall not charge the city a service charge or fee for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public right of ways. 
(c)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with an individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit approval, inspection, or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to any other regulatory ordinance, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04) 
Sec. 86-103. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges. 
    Stormwater service charges or fees shall be determined and modified from time to time by action of the city council. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the objective of the city council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair and reasonable and reflect the value of stormwater management and facilities relative to the benefit derived by the properties. Stormwater service charges or fees shall be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on any revenue bond obligation incurred for the construction and improvement to the stormwater system, as applicable. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04) 
Sec. 86-104. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
    Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from the utility service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater services charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04) 
Sec. 86-105. - Stormwater service charges/fees. 
(a)  Stormwater service charges shall be billed starting with the first billing cycle in February, 2004 except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
(b)  The following ERU standards shall apply: 
(1)  Stormwater service charges are based upon the number of ERU or increment thereof associated with developed land. The charge per ERU shall be $4.37 per month. 
(2)  Residential dwelling properties. Residential dwelling properties shall be charged a stormwater fee of one ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(3)  Other developed properties. All developed properties not classified as residential dwelling properties shall be billed for one ERU for each 3,800 square feet of impervious surface. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,800 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills, i.e. 1,000 to 3,799 square feet of impervious surface, which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the development shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased or owned interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior or exterior space available for occupancy. 
(c)  The customer of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the service charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for water or sewer services. If the developed property does not receive city water or sewer services the occupant or user, if no occupant or user then the owner, shall be billed. Regardless, of whether or not the developed property has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the service charge. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04; Ord. No. 0-12-14, arts. I, II, 7-17-14) 
Sec. 86-106. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections. 
    Failure to receive a bill for stormwater services is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the Owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of Fayette County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill for a period of up to three years, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. 
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04) 
Sec. 86-107. - Appeals. 
    Any person who can show that the impervious area allocated to such person's property is in error may appeal in the following manner: 
(a)  An appeal shall be filed in writing with the City of Fayetteville city manager. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
(b)  Using the information provided by the appellant, the city manager may conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 60 days. 
(c)  In response to an appeal, the city manager may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to the property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article. 
(d)  There shall be no further administrative appeal beyond the city manager.

(d)  Grease, oil, and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, grit and other harmful ingredients. All traps shall have a minimum capacity of 1,500 gallons and shall be of an approved type by the department, and shall be constructed outside of building and located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil traps shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. Grease and oil traps shall be constructed in any place or building having a capacity to serve group meals. 
(e)  Where installed, all grease, oil, sand and grit traps shall be maintained by the owner at his expense in order to provide efficient operation at all times. The department will inspect at it's discretion any and all grease traps. When a grease trap is found to be improperly maintained, the owner of the property will be notified in writing and shall have five business days to correct noted deficiencies. Failure to correct noted deficiencies within the allotted time period may result in a discontinuance of water and/or sewer service where applicable. Where discontinuance of service is inapplicable, violators shall be subject to the penalties as described in section 86-164. 
(f)  The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes having (1) a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 300 milligrams per liter by weight, or (2) containing more than 350 milligrams per liter by weight of suspended solids, or (3) containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in subsection (c) of this section, or (4) having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the average daily sewage flow of the sewer system, shall be subject to the review and approval of the director. Where necessary in the opinion of the director, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to: 
(1)  Reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 milligrams per liter and the suspended solids to 350 milligrams per liter by weight, or 
(2)  Reduce objectionable characteristics of constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in this section, or 
(3)  Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the commission together with a letter from the director approving the proposed preliminary treatment facilities, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing. 
(g)  Where preliminary treatment facilities are required for any waters or waste no permit will be granted until such pretreatment units have been placed in operation and have demonstrated their effectiveness by test. The cost of such testing, sampling and analyzing shall be borne by the waste contributor. Said preliminary treatment facilities shall be maintained continuously and satisfactorily in effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(h)  When required by the director, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying commercial-industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required shall be conveniently and safely located. It is to be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(i)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (c) and (f) shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewerage" or with methods approved by the city engineer and may be determined at the control manhole provided for in subsection (h), or upon suitable samples taken at said manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. If, in the judgment of the director, analyses must be performed which are beyond the scope of the laboratory at the sewage treatment plant, these analyses shall be performed at a laboratory designated by the director and the cost of these analyses shall be borne by the owner. 
(j)  No statement contained in this section shall be constructed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial, commercial or other owner from whose premises an industrial-commercial or domestic waste emanates which is of unusual strength or character from being accepted by the department for treatment subject to approval by applicable state and federal agencies and to payment therefore by such owner. 
(k)  Wastewater from any building sewer entering a public sewer, which is either domestic or nondomestic in nature but having a concentration of a given wastewater constituent higher than the defined normal standard, shall cause the user to be subject to a surcharge based on the following formula: 
Cs = [Bc (B) + Sc (S) + Pc (P)]Vu 
Where: 
Cs = A surcharge for wastewaters of excessive strength Bc = Operation and maintenance (O & M) cost for treatment of a unit of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) $19,682/175,036 lbs./yr. $0.112/lb. B = Concentration of BOD from a user above a base level of 300 mg/l (in pounds per 1,000 gallons) Sc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids (SS) $6,356/129,374 lbs./yr. $0.049/lb. S = Concentration of SS from a user above a base level of 350 mg/l (in pounds per 1,000 gallons) Pc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant (in dollars/lb.) P = Concentration of any pollutant from a user above a base level. The base level shall be determined by the average discharge of thepollutants by residential users. Vu = Volume contributed by a user per unit of time (in 1,000 gallons per month).  
Therefore: 
Cs = [$0.112/lb. (B) + $0.049/lb. (S) + Pc (P)] Vu 
    The department shall take 24-hour proportional composite samples of a user's sewage discharge to determine concentration levels of B, S and P and to determine a pattern of surcharges. Thereafter, the department may periodically take additional samples for the purpose of adjusting the surcharges. The user may request additional sampling and testing and obtain same provided the user bears the expense.

Sec. 86-170. - Definitions. 
    The following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article. 
(a)  Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action. 
(b)  Extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article. Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God. 
( Ord. No. 0-15-15, art. I , 8-6-15) 
Sec. 86-171. - White lining. 
(a)  Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate. 
(c)  Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20-foot tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site. 
(d)  Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows: 
(1)  For large projects as defined in O.C.G.A  25-9-3(18), unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GSPC Rule 515-9-4-13 (a copy of GPSC Rule 515-9-4-13 currently in effect is attached as Exhibit "A" and by reference is incorporated herein). Every contractor begins each large project with zero damages. It is only when three damages (at-fault damages) occur during the 90-day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered. A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon; 
(2)  Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining; 
(3)  "Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section; 
(4)  Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and 
(5)  Termite baiting systems. 
(e)  White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points. 

(f)  Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both. 
( Ord. No. 0-15-15, art. I , 8-6-15) 
Sec. 86-172. - Facility marking by or for utilities. 
(a)  Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities. 
(1)  To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner. 
(2)  The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks. 
(3)  Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet. If the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches. 

(4)  The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area. 

(5)  In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks. 

(6)  Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows: 

(7)  Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy. 

(8)  Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover). 

(9)  Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner. 

(10)  Unlocatable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocatable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocatable sewer lateral. 

(11)  When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines: 

(12)  If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches. 
(13)  Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot. 

(14)  In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow.

Sec. 94-12. - Powers of the planning and zoning commission and director to allow special exceptions and variances. 
(a)  The following provisions shall apply to special exceptions and variances: 
(1)  Submission of requests. Requests for variances from these zoning regulations, and special exceptions shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission pursuant to the following powers and procedures: 
a.  A written application for a variance or special exception, as approved and provided by the city, shall be submitted to the commission indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception or variance is sought, and stating the grounds upon which it is requested. 
b.  Before making its decision on a request, the commission shall hold a public hearing thereon. 
c.  At the expense of the applicant, the commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a variance or special exception in the newspaper used as the official legal organ for the City of Fayetteville, published at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall further cause the erection at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property in question, a sign as a notice to the public that a petition for a variance or special exception has been filed as to the property and that a public hearing will be held on the request before the planning and zoning commission, stating the date, time and place of that hearing. 
d.  The applicant or any aggrieved party may appear at the public hearing in person or by agent. 
e.  The board shall reach a decision within 30 days of the hearing. 
f.  Decision of the planning and zoning commission with regard to the grant of variance or special exceptions may be reviewed by the city council pursuant to article II of this zoning chapter. 
(2)  Standards for review for special exception. 
a.  General policy. Special exceptions are neither absolutely permitted as a matter of right nor prohibited in particular zoning districts. Such uses of property are permitted as generally compatible with the zoning district, but not in every location therein, nor without certain standards or other requirements or conditions met. Uses which require special exceptions are potentially incompatible with uses usually allowed in the particular district or particularly incompatible with nearby or contiguous districts. 
b.  Standards for review. Special emphasis shall be placed on the justification for the proposed use at the proposed location and how the proposal relates to and affects neighboring properties. Therefore, the commission and the council, on appeal, shall consider among other matters, the statement of general policy stated above and the following: 
1.  Compliance with the City of Fayetteville's zoning ordinance. 
2.  The character and use of buildings and structures adjoining or in the vicinity of the subject property. 
3.  The compatibility of the proposed use at the subject property to the present uses of the buildings, structures, or properties adjoining or in the vicinity of the subject property. 
4.  Impact of the proposed use on nearby properties, including existing and possible future uses. 
5.  Impact of the proposed use on public facilities, utilities and public infrastructure. 
6.  Appropriateness of the proposed use as related to the city's land use plan. 
7.  The number of persons residing, studying, working in or otherwise occupying buildings adjoining or in the vicinity of the subject property. 
8.  Traffic conditions in the area of the proposed use and possible aggravation of traffic conditions by the proposed use. 
9.  Accessibility of building for fire and police protection. 
10.  Materials of combustible, explosive or inflammable nature to be sold, stored, or kept on the premises. 
11.  Protection of occupants of adjoining and surrounding buildings from noise, dust, gases, pollution. 
12.  Population density in the surrounding area and threats to the public safety created by the proposed use. 
13.  Relationship of the proposed use to the neighboring areas in the context of how the use might service or have utility to the area. 
14.  Adequacy of the site in terms of protecting and screening nearby properties from adverse impacts which might result from the proposed use. 
15.  The number, size, and type of signs proposed for the site. 
16.  The amount and location of open space on the site. 
17.  Hours and manner of operation of the proposed use. 
18.  The type of electrical illumination for the proposed use with special reference to its effects on nearby structures and the glare, if any, from such illumination in surrounding sleeping quarters. 
19.  Adequacy of ingress and egress to the property. 
20.  Impact of the proposed use on the property values of surrounding properties at the uses for which the surrounding properties are presently being used. 
c.  Conditional approval. The commission or the city council, upon appeal, may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to insure compatibility of the proposed use with the neighboring area and with the policies of the city's zoning ordinance and land use plan and the standards of this chapter. Such conditions may include, at a minimum, any of the following: 
1.  The existence of certain public facilities, utilities, or infrastructures. 
2.  The existence of traffic control devices or modifications to streets and traffic patterns. 
3.  Parking. 
4.  Screening or buffering. 
5.  Distance from other similar uses. 
6.  Building or improvement setbacks. 
7.  Minimum lot size. 
8.  Hours of operation. 
9.  Number and location of curb cuts or driveway entrances into public roads or into the subject tract. 
10.  Type and placement of outdoor lighting. 
11.  Type and placement of signs. 
12.  Physical design and layout of property. 
13.  Limitations on operation of use. 
d.  Compliance requirements. Once granted, and unless otherwise extended by city council upon notice from the property owner showing that the applicant is proceeding with development in due course, a special exception permit shall be valid for 365 days except where a development permit has been obtained. If a development permit has been obtained during the 365-day period, then the parcel may continue to be used pursuant to the special exception permit. If the property owner fails to obtain a development permit within the 365-day period, then such special exception permit shall expire. The zoning administrator or his designee may issue a stop work order and may initiate action to revoke a special exception whenever the zoning administrator or his designee has reason to believe that the conditions of approval or conditions of the zoning ordinances are not being followed. 
Prior to the approval of a land disturbance permit, a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, a site plan based on a certified boundary survey of the property, showing the exact location of all improvements, and incorporating the stipulations of the special exception and meeting and exceeding the requirements of this zoning chapter, shall be first approved. 
e.  Procedures for application for special exception. Application for special exception shall include all information required for a rezoning application by a property owner. In addition, such application shall include a letter of intent indicating specifically how the property is to be used, hours of operation, a front elevation and rendering of all proposed buildings and any existing buildings which are to remain on the property, and a site plan showing the exact location of improvements on the tract as presently built or as will be built. Any proposed additions or expansions which have not previously been incorporated into an approved special exception will require approval under this section before issuance of any land disturbance permits, building permits, or occupancy permits. 
(3)  Criteria for granting of variance. The commission may authorize, only in the specific cases of height and size of structures, buffers, yard requirements, parking, fences, pools, and accessory buildings, such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in question nor shall it allow an increase in density that exceeds the stated maximum of the subject zoning district. Such variance may be granted, in an individual case, upon a finding by the commission that the following exists: 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question, because of its size, shape or topography; and 
b.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved and were not created by the applicant; and 
d.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the City of Fayetteville Comprehensive Plan or the intent of the City of Fayetteville Zoning Ordinance provided, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter; nor shall it allow a greater residential density that is permitted by this chapter and relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations provided, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter; and 
e.  A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed; however, 
f.  Provided that the commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the commission shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that any of the terms, conditions, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not complied with, said commission shall rescind and remove such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
(4)  Criteria for granting of administrative variance. The director of planning and zoning may authorize, only in the specific cases of the distance of fences in subsection 94-401(d) of this Code, the location and distance requirements for accessory uses in subsection 94-306 (a)-(b) of this Code, the minimum rear yard setback as referenced in sections 94-266 and 94-267 of this Code for residences with enclosed rear porches, such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in question. Such variance may be granted, in an individual case, upon a finding by the director that the following exists: 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question, because of its size, shape or topography; and 
b.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
d.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations provided, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter; and 
e.  A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed; however, 
(a)  Within ten days of the director's decision, the planning and zoning commission or city council may review any variance granted under this subsection (4). During this ten-day "waiting period" no work may commence. Also, if either the planning and zoning commission or city council requests a review, no work may commence until the requesting body has rendered a decision. 
(b)  A variance will not be granted to relieve a landowner from a hardship that is self-created. 
(c)  In exercising the above powers, the director shall not consider any nonconforming use of the neighboring lands, structures or building in the same district and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance.

ARTICLE III. - AMENDMENTS 

Sec. 94-86. - Amendments permitted. 
    This zoning chapter including the zoning map may be amended from time to time by the city council of Fayetteville, Georgia. 
(Ord. of 4-15-96, art. XVI,  1600; Ord. No. 0-11-99, 3-15-99) 
Sec. 94-87. - Amendment procedure. 
    The procedure for amending this zoning chapter shall be as outlined below: 
(1)  Any person or persons desiring to submit a petition requesting a change in zoning shall file such petition with a plat of the affected property attached thereto and a clearly identified, detailed development plan illustrating the proposed use thereof, together with a payment of the amount determined by the city council from time to time as an appropriate fee for same to cover administrative costs, with the city clerk. The petitioner may also be required to submit additional information as may be useful and necessary to the deliberations on the zoning change. Information submitted to the city by the applicant, either in written or verbal form, and accepted by the city council shall become an amendment to the application and shall be a condition to the rezoning as provided below. Such amendments and conditions may be evidenced by written representations submitted to the city by the applicant or as contained in the minutes of council, both of which are incorporated into any rezoning ordinance granted on the application. 
(2)  Any condition or conditions imposed upon the petitioner by the city council in its ordinance, or as contained in its minutes, or as contained in written representations by the applicant, accepted by the city council, must be satisfied before the change in status will take permanent effect. Should the imposed condition(s) fail to be performed within the prescribed time period set forth by the city in either the council minutes or ordinance or in the application, if not otherwise so stated, then within one year, the property at issue will automatically revert to the status or classification it occupied before the petitioner's application to rezone was filed. 
(3)  The petitioner's substantial compliance, within 12 months of the date of the ordinance of rezoning, with the plans for the project proposed in the development plan submitted with the initial applicant's application for rezoning, and as thereafter amended by the applicant and accepted by the city council, is required. Substantial compliance means that the applicant must have initiated development of the project to the point that it is clearly in progress in accordance within the plan. The applicant's final representation of proposed use of the site, the final development plans presented to the mayor and council in support of the application (and accepted by the mayor and council as reflected in the zoning ordinance or the council's minutes of the proceedings), and the implementation of any conditions imposed upon the proposed use and/or development plans, shall be conditions to the continued existence of any rezoning granted by this chapter. If, within 12 months of the re-classification granted by this chapter, the applicant fails to initiate development of the subject site in conformity with said uses and development plans, including any conditions imposed by the council, the zoning granted in the ordinance of rezoning shall be automatically revocated, and the land's zoning classification shall revert to the zoning classification of the land prior to the rezoning.

(4)  Conditions include those contained in the minutes of the planning and zoning commission (upon approval by city council) and the city council, which shall become a part of the ordinance when enacted, and written representations submitted by the applicant to the city, and accepted by the city council, which shall become an amendment to the applicant's rezoning application and a part of the enacted ordinance. 
(5)  All amendments shall be proposed by or shall first be submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendation prior to adoption by the city council.

Notice of the time and place of any such public hearing, the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property, shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the hearing date. Unless a proposed amendment is otherwise tabled for later consideration, if the planning commission fails to submit a report to the city council within the 60-day review period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment. Withdrawal of an application before the planning commission is allowed, however, such withdrawal is governed by the following: 
a.  Any applicant withdrawing his petition after advertisement of the application but prior to the formal consideration by the planning commission can reapply but there can be no resubmission for consideration prior to the next regularity scheduled planning and zoning commission meeting. 
b.  Any withdrawal after formal action of the planning commission must be in writing and delivered to the mayor and council. Such written withdraw shall not be effective until acted upon and accepted by the city council, which the city council, in its sole discretion, may or may not accept. Any withdrawal accepted by the city council after formal action by the planning and zoning commission shall require a six-month waiting period prior to resubmission for consideration. 
(6)  After the 60-day planning commission review period, proposed amendments to this zoning chapter shall be submitted to the city council for adoption, modification, or rejection. Before the city council acts on an amendment to this zoning chapter, it shall hold a public hearing thereon, at least 15 days' notice of the time and place of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. In addition, the city shall, at the expense of the applicant, erect, at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property in question, a sign of not less than nine square feet, with not less than three inch black letters upon a white background, which shall read as follows:

Sec. 94-172. - Planned community district (PCD). 
    The zoning designation of "planned community district" (PCD) allows for the creation of an individual site-specific zoning district, distinct in scope and purpose, which is attached to a particular parcel of land. Said PCD zoning runs with the land, and may not be transferred to another parcel. The PCD allows an applicant to designate a mixture and arrangement of land uses, not normally available under traditional Euclidian zoning. Application for the designation of PCD shall be in the form of a conceptual master plan, along with a narrative and all supporting documentation. Once approved by city council, the PCD master plan becomes the guiding document for the development of the PCD, and shall not be altered without approval from city council. 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  The purpose of a planned community is to encourage the best possible site planning and arrangement of land uses under a unified plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. Tracts of five acres or larger are required for this district. The PCD district is designed to include residential, commercial and/or office zoning districts as appropriate to provide flexibility in the application of development standards and site design when approved according to a master development plan in a manner to promote the conservation of natural environment, more efficient use of land, and efficiency in the extension of streets and utilities. 
b.  Specifically, the PCD sets forth a framework for traditional neighborhood development that encourages pedestrian-scale residential, commercial, and office activities to be designed in such a way as to reduce the number and type of vehicle trips, limiting congestion and thereby improving air quality. Conventional development is also addressed in a manner to promote the clustering of residential land use to set aside areas for recreation and open space while providing for varied forms of pedestrian and bicycle movement that is buffered from commercial and office activities. The developer benefits by having flexibility from the underlying or existing zoning regulations attached to the parcel in question. The city benefits by being assured of the long term development plans for a specific parcel, while coordinating those plans with the comprehensive plan, and insuring compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the planning and zoning commission provides an opportunity to ensure the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. All planned developments shall be located on paved city roads with a minimum classification of collector street according to section 94-135. In most cases, each area within a PCD project developed for residential (including required open space and recreational amenities), commercial or office land use shall be designated as mixed use according to the master development plan unless a single use within the site can better accomplish the goals established herein. Typically, projects should consist of more than one type of land use to be considered a PCD project, however, single-use projects that would best benefit the city under the PCD classification will be considered by city council. 
c.  The natural features, arrangement of land uses, and departures from existing zoning and development standards, shall be represented on a master plan. 
d.  The PCD is not intended to circumvent the parameters of existing zoning, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. Planned community district zoning is not intended to be used for speculative purposes to enhance the value of property. As such, approval of a PCD will be as a conditional use, based upon a detailed master plan submitted as part of the application. If construction is not commenced within one year, and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the planning and zoning commission may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the approved PCD to fit the scope of actual development. The planning and zoning commission and/or developer may make no changes to the approved master plan without review and recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, and approval by city council. 
e.  Objectives. To carry out the purpose of this section, a PCD district must provide the following, as appropriate: 
1.  A range in the types of residential environment, including types of housing, and community facilities/recreation activities available. 
2.  Nonresidential land uses, if any, which provide convenient service, employment, and access. 
3.  Conservation of natural topographical and geological features with emphasis upon: 
i.  Conservation of existing surface and sub-surface water resources; 
ii.  Preservation of major trees and other significant natural environmental features; 
iii.  Prevention of soil erosion; 
4.  An efficient network of streets and utilities appropriate to serve the land uses within the PCD district. 
5.  Creation of a mixture of uses that decrease reliance on the use of the automobile and to encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. 
6.  A master development plan to guide the PCD with specific development objectives, which shall be included in conditions, covenants, and restrictions. 
f.  Definitions. For this purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning immediately set forth after the term.

(4)  Accessory buildings. The design of accessory buildings should reflect and coordinate with the general style of architectural inherent in the primary structure on the property. 
(5)  [ Illumination. ] No exterior architectural element shall be internally illuminated (except as allowed by the city's sign ordinance) or highlighted by neon lighting. 
(c)  Signage. 
(1)  General requirements. In addition to the provisions of the City of Fayetteville sign ordinance, the following provisions shall apply to signs in this overlay district:

(b)  Nonconforming uses. Any existing nonconformity presently not meeting the site design standards, general standards, landscaping and lighting standards of this division 4 shall be brought into compliance, to the greatest degree practical, if any portion of the site design, general landscaping, and lighting standards is changed, expanded, or altered. Land uses discontinued for more than six months shall conform to the landscaping, lighting and site design provisions of this division 4 as reasonably related to existing site constraints, to be determined by the planning and zoning commission.

2.  All exterior luminaires that operate at greater than 100 watts shall contain lamps having a minimum efficacy of 60 lumens/watt unless the luminaire is controlled by a motion sensor. 
(10)  Illumination levels. All site lighting shall be designed so that the level of illumination as measured in footcandles (fc) at any one point meets the following standards. Minimum and maximum levels are measured at any one point. Average level is not to exceed the specified limit by more than 20 percent, and is derived using only the area of the site included to receive illumination. Points of measure shall not include the area of the building or areas which do not lend themselves to pedestrian traffic. Also, if the major portion of the lighting design is to be in the front of a building, the average level should not be affected by adding a light or two in the back of the same building, which would raise the average of the intended area for lighting.

ARTICLE VIII. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT/CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION AND OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT[6] 
Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 0-9-05, art. 5, adopted April 7, 2005, changed the title of art. VIII of this chapter from "Planned Unit Development" to "Planned Unit Development/Conservation Subdivision and Open Space Development." 

[DIVISION 1. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT] 

Sec. 94-356. - Purpose of planned unit developments. 
(a)  The purpose of planned unit developments is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. The city gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the planning and zoning commission provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. 
(b)  The planned unit development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. The planned unit development is, furthermore, not intended to enhance the value of property for speculative purposes. Approval of a planned unit development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one year, and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the planning commission may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual development. All planned unit developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted. No changes to the approved plan may be made without review and approval by the planning commission.

Type of Development Minimum 
Acreage Planned residential developments 5 Planned commercial centers 2 Planned industrial parks 5 Planned office-industrial parks 2 Planned community districts 5  
(Ord. of 4-15-96, art. XII,  1201; Ord. No. 0-11-99, 3-15-99; Ord. No. 0-5-00, art. I, 4-3-00) 
Sec. 94-358. - Ownership control. 
    All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by a person or joint tenants or tenants in common. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. 
(Ord. of 4-15-96, art. XII,  1202; Ord. No. 0-11-99, 3-15-99) 
Sec. 94-359. - Standards applying to all planned unit developments. 
    All planned unit developments shall meet the following standards and such other requirements as are set forth with respect to each of the five permitted types of planned unit developments: 
(1)  The development shall be compatible with the topography of the land and shall preserve any unusual topographic or natural features. 
(2)  The development shall not adversely affect developed or undeveloped neighboring properties. 
(3)  The development shall utilize design and development features that would not be possible by the application of lot-by-lot zoning district regulations. 
(4)  Water, sewerage, and street facilities shall be adequate for the proposed development or there shall be a definite proposal for making them so. 
(5)  Yards. The yard requirements of the zoning district or districts in which the planned unit development is located may be adjusted by the planning commission except along the exterior boundaries of the development. Buffer zone requirements shall be met. 
(6)  Height. The height limitations of the zoning district or districts in which the planned unit development is located may be adjusted by the planning commission.

[DIVISION 2. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION AND OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT] 

Sec. 94-365. - Purposes. 
    [The purposes of this division are:] 
(1)  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
(2)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
(3)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
(4)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
(5)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
(6)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
(7)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions. 
(8)  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
(9)  To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
(10)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
(11)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
(12)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
(Ord. No. 0-9-05, arts. 1, 2, 4-7-05) 
Sec. 94-366. - General regulations. 
(a)  Applicability of regulations. This conservation subdivision and open space ordinance is an overlay residential district to be used with R-70, R-40, and R-30 zoning districts on parcels of five acres or more. With the conservation subdivision and open space ordinance the applicant will be allowed to vary lot size, yard sizes, setbacks, and house placement; however, the underlying zoning district shall control density, number of residents, heated-space resident square footage, and total land size of subdivision, subject to the five acre minimum. The conservation subdivision and open space overlay district is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. The conservation subdivision and open space district is, furthermore, not intended to enhance the value of property for speculative purposes. Approval of a conservation subdivision and open space overlay district zoning of a particular parcel of land is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one year, and pursued in an orderly, continuous and unbroken manner toward completion, the city council may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the overlay zoning as to the property, or reduce the size of the tract approved for the overlay district to fit the scope of actual development. All conservation subdivision and open space overlay district developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted. No changes to the approved plan may be made without review and approval by the planning commission. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein. 
(b)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
(c)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the City of Fayetteville City Manager or his designee: 
(1)  Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
a.  Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area; 
b.  The 100-year floodplain; 
c.  Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area; 
d.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act; or, 
e.  Anticipated right-of-way or existing roads and utilities. 
(2)  Yield plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations. 
(d)  Yards. The yard requirements of the conservation subdivisions may be adjusted by the planning commission except along the exterior boundaries of the development. buffer zone requirements shall be met. 
(Ord. No. 0-9-05, arts. 1, 2, 4-7-05)

(a)  Whenever the regulations of this article require a greater width, depth or size of yard or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other statute or covenants, the requirements of this article shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute or covenants require more restrictive standards than those of this article, the provisions of such statutes or covenants shall govern. 
(b)  Any preexisting antenna, tower, or telecommunication facility which does not meet the requirements of this article shall be considered nonconforming and subject to the nonconforming use provisions of the Fayetteville zoning ordinance; provided, however, that the installation of a new antenna on a preexisting tower or monopole shall not constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use provided that (a) the new antenna does not result in a substantial increase in size and (b) the resulting height of the preexisting tower or monopole is less than the maximum height of the tower previously approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 0-2-17 , art. 1, 3-2-17) 
Sec. 94-526. - Annual registration of towers and antennas. 
    The owner of any telecommunications tower or antenna shall submit an annual registration of such structure, by tax parcel number and physical street address, on such forms as the chief building inspector shall prescribe. Each annual registration of such a structure shall describe all facilities on the site, describe in detail any improvements during the preceding calendar year, and, for towers only, state the total gross income from all improvements on the site for the preceding calendar year. Each annual return shall be filed on or before April 1st of each year and shall be accompanied by an administrative fee as established by the mayor and council. 
(Ord. No. 0-2-17 , art. 1, 3-2-17) 
Sec. 94-527. - Principal or accessory use. 
    A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(Ord. No. 0-2-17 , art. 1, 3-2-17) 
Sec. 94-528. - Inventory of existing sites. 
(a)  The Fayetteville department of building and inspections shall maintain an inventory of all towers or alternative tower structures, active and inactive, which are present in Fayetteville. This inventory shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be decided by the department. 
(b)  To facilitate the co-location of antennas, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower or alternative tower structure or modify any such existing tower or alternative tower shall provide to the department an inventory of its existing towers or alternative tower structures as provided for below. The applicant shall specifically identify its towers or alternative structures, active or inactive, which are present in Fayetteville. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna less than 40 feet in height shall be exempt from this provision. 
(c)  The applicant's inventory shall include all of its structures that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border of Fayetteville, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department. The department shall share such information with other applicants under this article or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of Fayetteville, provided, however that the department shall not, by sharing such information, in any way be deemed to have represented or warranted that such sites are available or suitable. 
(d)  An application shall not be considered complete without the inventory required in this section. 
(Ord. No. 0-2-17 , art. 1, 3-2-17) 
Sec. 94-529. - Co-location; availability of suitable existing structures. 
    Applicants for the erection of an antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure. No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and mayor and council that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The applicant must present an affidavit which lists the available existing towers and reasons why co-location on those towers is not possible. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts and shall consist of more than mere conclusory statements that no existing tower is suitable. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following: 
(1)  That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic search area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  That existing towers or structures within the geographic search area do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment. 
(3)  That the applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures in the geographic search area, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures in the geographic search area, would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(4)  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure in the geographic search area or to adapt an existing tower or structure for collocation are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
(5)  That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
    For each of the above, the applicant must provide a listing of the existing towers or structures within the geographic search area that were considered, and ultimately rejected, by the applicant and provide a detailed explanation of why the existing towers or structures within the geographic search area are not suitable.
