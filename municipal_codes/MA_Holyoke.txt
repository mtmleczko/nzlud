PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through August 1, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 STATE LAWS ACCEPTED OR ADOPTED SL:1 CHARTER AND SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Linda Davis, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Susan M. Egan, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Holyoke readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The board shall complete their certification on or before five o'clock in the afternoon of the seventh Tuesday preceding such regular or special municipal election, and the board, or some member thereof, shall file with the city clerk on or before five o'clock in the afternoon of the next day all papers not found to be invalid as aforesaid. 
(Acts 1959, c. 173) 
Editor's note- The 1959 amendment struck out the word "fifth" in the last sentence of this section and inserted the word "seventh" in place thereof. 
    Section 5. On the first day, other than a legal holiday, following the expiration of the time for filing the above described nomination papers with the city clerk, he shall post in a conspicuous place in his office the names and residences of the candidates for nomination who have duly qualified as such, as they are to appear on the official ballots to be used at the preliminary election, except as to the order of the names, which shall be drawn by lot by the city clerk within seventy-two hours succeeding five o'clock in the afternoon of the last day fixed for filing the nomination papers with him, and he shall cause the ballots, which shall contain said names in their order as drawn by him, and no others, with a designation of residence, and of the office and term of office, to be printed, and the ballots so printed shall be official and no others shall be used at the preliminary election. At any drawing for position on the ballot, each candidate shall have an opportunity to be present in person or by one representative. There shall be left at the end of the list of candidates for nomination for each office blank spaces equal in number to the number of persons to be nominated therefor, in which spaces the voter may insert the name of any person not printed on the ballot for whom he desires to vote for nomination for such office, but the name of such person shall not be printed on the official ballot to be voted for at any regular or special municipal election in said city unless such person is qualified to be nominated under section three. There shall be printed on such ballots such directions as will aid the voter, as, for example: "vote for one," "vote for two," and the like, and the ballots shall be headed substantially as follows: 
Official Preliminary Ballot. 
    Candidates for nomination for the offices of (names of offices) in the city of Holyoke at a preliminary election to be held on the _______ day of ________, in the year nineteen hundred and ___. 
    On the back and outside of each ballot when folded shall be printed the words "Official Ballot for preliminary Election", followed by the designation of the ward for which the ballot is prepared, the date of the preliminary election and a facsimile of the signature of the city clerk. 
    Section 6. No ballot used at any preliminary election in said city shall have printed thereon any party or political designation or mark, and there shall not be appended to the name of any candidate any such party or political designation or mark, or anything showing how he was nominated or indicating his views or opinion. 
    Section 7. The election officers of said city shall, immediately upon the closing of the polls at preliminary elections, count the ballots and ascertain the number of votes cast in the several voting places for each candidate, and forthwith make return thereof upon blanks to be furnished, as in regular elections, to the city clerk, who shall canvass said returns and shall forthwith determine the result thereof, insert the same in a newspaper published in said city and post the same in a conspicuous place in his office. 
    Section 8. If any person receives at a preliminary election a majority of all the votes cast for the office for nomination to which he was a candidate, he shall be deemed and declared elected thereto; provided, that at said election at least eighty percent of the total registered vote of the city, or, in the case of a ward alderman, of the ward, shall be cast; otherwise the two persons receiving at a preliminary election the highest number of votes for nomination for any office, except one to which two or more persons are to be elected at the regular or special municipal election following, and, as to each of such offices, the several persons in number equal to twice the number so to be elected receiving at such preliminary election the highest number of votes for nomination for that office, shall, except as provided in this section and in section nine, be the sole candidates for that office whose names may be printed on the official ballot to be used at the regular or special municipal election at which such office is to be filled. 
    If the preliminary election results in a tie vote among candidates for nomination to any office receiving the lowest number of votes, which, but for said tie vote, would entitle a person receiving the same to have his name printed upon the official ballot for the regular or special municipal election, all candidates participating in said tie vote shall have their names printed upon the official ballot, although in consequences there be printed thereon the names of candidates to a number exceeding twice the number to be elected. 
    Section 9. If at the expiration of the time for filing with the city clerk nomination papers for candidates to be voted for at any preliminary election there have not been filed with him more than twice as many such nomination papers for an office as there are persons to be elected to such office, the candidates whose nomination papers have thus been filed shall be deemed to have been nominated to said office, and their names shall be printed on the official ballot to be used at the regular or special municipal election following, and the city clerk shall not print said names upon the ballot to be used at said preliminary election, and no other nomination to said office shall be made. If in consequence it shall appear that no names are to be printed upon the official ballot to be used at any preliminary election in any ward or wards of said city, no preliminary election shall be held in any such ward or wards. 
    Section 10. So much of chapter four hundred and thirty-eight of the acts of eighteen hundred and ninety-six, and acts in amendment thereof, and in addition thereto, as is inconsistent with this act, is hereby repealed. 
    Section 11. This act shall be submitted for acceptance to the registered voters of the City of Holyoke at the municipal election to be held in the year nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, in the form of the following question, which shall be printed on the official ballot to be used in said city at said election:-"Shall an act passed by the general court in the year nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, entitled `An Act establishing Preliminary Municipal Elections in the City of Holyoke,' be accepted?" If the majority of the votes in answer to said question is in the affirmative, then this act shall thereupon take full effect for the regular municipal election to be held in said city in the year nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and for all municipal elections in said city thereafter, but not otherwise.

(b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to foster the collection of unpaid taxes and assessments, promote residential stability and community reinvestment. The city finds and determines that such a program will mitigate the social cost and consequences of property seizures and will help delinquent taxpayers meet their obligations to the city while avoiding the legal expenses and time delays of taking the property to land court. During the term of any municipal tax repayment agreement, the treasurer may not bring an action to foreclose the tax title account unless the taxpayer fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the municipal tax repayment agreement. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall be applicable: 
    Commercial taxpayer shall mean the owner of record of an industrial or commercial use property or of a residential property with four or more units.

    Residential taxpayer shall mean the owner of record of a residential property with less than four units.

During the term of the residential tax repayment agreement the taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule and must remain current on all other amounts due the city that are a lien on the same parcel. 
(3)  A delinquent residential taxpayer who is a senior citizen over the age of 60 and has documented that he or she (or them) is living on a fixed income may enter into a residential hardship agreement, the term of which shall not exceed five years.

During the term of the commercial tax repayment agreement the taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule and must remain current on all other amounts due the city that are a lien on the same parcel. 
(3)  If the balance of a tax title account for a commercial property exceeds that parcel's assessed value as determined by the assessor's office as of the date of the agreement, then such parcel shall be granted a 50 percent waiver of the interest that has accrued on the amount of the tax title account. 
(f)  Tax repayment agreements, generally. 
(1)  If a delinquent tax payer is the record owner of more than one parcel that is in tax title, they shall enter into one tax repayment agreement that covers all of the parcels. Delinquent tax payers that own more than one parcel in tax title shall not be allowed to enter into tax repayment agreements for a single parcel. 
(2)  Upon entering into a tax repayment agreement, the required 25 percent down payment shall be made to the treasurer in the form of certified funds or cash. At the conclusion of the repayment agreement, the final payment shall also be in the form of certified funds or cash. 
(3)  Calculation of a waiver of interest authorized under this section shall be made only after at least 25 percent of the amount needed to redeem that parcel or parcel(s) from tax title is first paid to the treasurer. 
(4)  During the term of the repayment agreement, all payments shall be made in the amounts and at the time provided by the schedule in said repayment agreement. A returned check shall constitute a violation of the repayment agreement and may be subject to fines as set by the treasurer in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws. 
(5)  During the term of the repayment agreement, all current assessed taxes, water, sewer, Holyoke Gas and Electric charges, or any other charge which may become a lien on the same parcel or parcels that are the subject of the repayment agreement shall be paid when due and in full.

(7)  No extensions or amendments to the terms as set forth in this section shall be allowed. 
(8)  For so long as such repayment agreements are in effect with all payments having been made in accordance with the above, then the treasurer shall not bring an action to foreclose the tax title on such parcel(s). 
(g)  Violations and penalties. 
(1)  Should any taxpayer default on a repayment agreement by a) failing to make payments under the agreement as provided in the schedule or having a check for a payment returned, or b) failing to stay current on taxes and other charges that are a lien on the same parcel(s), then said repayment agreement shall be terminated immediately. In the event of a default, the full amount of the tax title, including all interest will immediately become due and the treasurer may bring an action to foreclose the tax title on such parcel(s). 
(2)  In the event that the taxpayer defaults on a repayment agreement and the treasurer has not foreclosed on the tax title, the taxpayer may not enter into a subsequent repayment agreement.

(a)  Purpose and application: This division shall apply to every contract for the procurement of supplies, services, or real property and for disposing of supplies or real property by the municipal government of Holyoke. It is the goal of the city that all contracts are to be awarded in a fair and competitive manner that ensures the best prices and service to the city. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this division, all terms shall have the same meanings as used in M.G.L. ch. 30B. The term "governmental body" as used in M.G.L., ch. 30B shall mean the City of Holyoke and all of its departments, committees and boards, including the school department pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 41, § 103.

Sec. 2-335. - Requirements for contracts exempt from competitive bidding process. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council hereby finds that there is a broad concern raised by ordinary citizens over the ability of business and individual donors to potentially influence governmental decisions by making substantial campaign contributions to elected officials with the specific goal of obtaining favorable-treatment in the award of city contracts that are exempt from a competitive bidding process. In the interest of good government, the city council desires to establish a policy that will provide the public with notice and avoid the perception of improper influence in local elections. The city council finds that it is appropriate to enact reasonable restrictions on campaign contributions from certain persons or entities who seek certain contracts as set forth herein.

(4)  Person. An individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, joint venture, or any other legal entity.

b.  All contributions made by the contractor during the 12 months prior to the date application to any person who was a candidate for elective office of the city by stating the name of the person who made the contribution, the candidate who received the contribution, and the date and amount of each such contribution. For purposes of this division, elected office of the City of Holyoke shall mean the mayor, treasurer, city clerk, city council, and school committee of the city.

(3)  A certification by the contractor that if awarded the contract, the contractor and anyone attributed to the contract, as defined above, shall not make any contribution in any calendar year to any individual incumbent or to any individual candidate for elective office of the City of Holyoke for the next four calendar years following the award of the contract, or for the duration of the term of any contract, whichever is longer. 
(e)  Prohibition on awarding contracts to certain contributors. 
(1)  No contract shall be awarded to any person who has made a total contribution of more than $200.00 if an individual or $1,000.00 total if a corporation, partnership or limited liability corporation to any individual candidate for elected office of the City of Holyoke or incumbent in either the calendar year of the application or the calendar year preceding the application, provided, however, that the restriction of eligibility with regard to contributions made prior to the year preceding the application shall not apply to any contributions made in the calendar year preceding the adoption of this division and shall only go forward beginning with the year of adoption of the division. No contribution made prior to the effective date of this division shall be deemed to give rise to a violation or penalty under this division. 
(2)  No contract may be renewed, extended, or materially amended, unless the resulting renewal, extension, or amendment, would be allowable under the provisions of this division as if it were an initial contract. 
(3)  A contractor shall not make any contribution to any incumbent or to any candidate for elective office of the City of Holyoke for the next four calendar years following the award of the item, or for the duration of the term of any contract, whichever is longer. 
(f)  Penalties. The city shall deny the award of a contract subject to this division if it is found that a person made a material misstatement on the mandatory disclosure form or if the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this section. If a contract is awarded, it shall be a material breach of the terms of any contract where contractor which is a party to such contract made any contribution in violation of this division and the contract shall be rescinded. 
(g)  Refund of contribution. Prior to the award of a contract, a person may cure a contribution which violates this division if the person requests a refund in writing from the candidate or incumbent who received the contribution, and within 30 days of the request, the person receives a refund of a contribution from the incumbent or any candidate for elective office in the City of Holyoke or political committee for such incumbent or candidate. Notwithstanding the above, if there is a contribution in violation of this division, the candidate or incumbent shall refund the contribution within 30 days of receipt of a request for refund, provided that funds are otherwise available in the campaign account of the candidate or incumbent. This division shall be interpreted and applied consistent with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

b.  In the case of a proposed acquisition, the city council determines in writing that advertising will not benefit the governmental body's interest because of the unique qualities or location of the property needed.

The city council shall publish the determination and the reasons for the determination, along with the names of the parties having a beneficial interest in the property pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 7, § 40J, the location and size of the property, and the proposed purchase price or rental terms, in the central register not less than 30 days before the city council executes a bidding agreement to acquire the property.

(b)  Definitions. Unless specifically indicated otherwise in this chapter or M.G.L. c. 30B, these definitions shall apply and control:

(5)  The chief procurement officer may consider any contractor's deviation from the CORI standards as grounds for rejection, rescission, revocation, or any other termination of the contract. 
(d)  CORI-related standards. The CORI-related policies and practices of the city shall include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  The city has a policy of affording a rehabilitated individual with a criminal record a fair opportunity to be employed and reintegrate successfully into the workforce, while protecting vulnerable populations and the public safety. Consistent with this policy, a criminal record will not automatically disqualify an applicant from employment, unless explicitly mandated by law. 
(2)  The city will not conduct a CORI check on an applicant unless a CORI check is required by law or the city has made a good faith determination that the relevant position is of such sensitivity that a CORI report is warranted. 
(3)  The city reviews the qualifications of an applicant and determines that an applicant is otherwise qualified for the relevant position before the city conducts a CORI check. The city does not conduct a CORI check for an applicant that is not otherwise qualified for a relevant position. 
(4)  If the city has been authorized by the CHSB to receive CORI reports consisting solely of conviction and case-pending information and the CORI report received by the city contains other unauthorized information (e.g., cases disposed favorably for the applicant such as not guilty or dismissal) then the city informs the applicant and provides the applicant with a copy of the CHSB's information for the applicant to pursue correction with the CHSB. 
(5)  When the city receives a proper CORI report of an applicant that contains only the CORI information that the city is authorized to receive and the city is inclined to refuse, rescind, or revoke the offer of a position to an applicant then the city fully complies with 803 CMR 6.11, including, but not limited to, notifying the applicant of the potential adverse employment action, providing the applicant with a photocopy of the CORI report received by the city, informing the applicant of the specific parts of the CORI report that concern the city, providing an opportunity for the applicant to discuss the CORI report with the city including an opportunity for the applicant to present information rebutting the accuracy and/or relevance of the CORI report, reviewing any information and documentation received from the applicant, and documenting all steps taken to comply with 803 CMR 6.11. 
(6)  The city makes final employment-related decisions based on all of the information available to the city, including the seriousness of the crime(s), the relevance of the crime(s), the number of crimes, the age of the crime(s), and the occurrences in the life of the applicant since the crime(s). If the final decision of the city is adverse to the applicant and results in the refusal, rescission, or revocation of a position with the city then the city promptly notifies the applicant of the decision and the specific reason(s) thereof. 
(e)  Waiver. Under exigent circumstances, the chief procurement officer may grant a waiver of this section on a contract-by-contract basis and shall submit a written record of the waiver to the city council. The written record shall include, but not be limited to, (a) a summary of the terms of the contract, (b) the details of the contractor's failure or refusal to conform with the city's CORI-related standards, and (c) a brief analysis of the exigency causing the grant of waiver. No waiver may be considered perfected unless the chief procurement officer fully complies with the provisions of the subsection. 
(f)  Applicability. If any provision of these sections shall be held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision shall be considered separately and apart from the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

Sec. 18-35. - Regulation of blighted and vacant buildings. 
(a)  Purpose and declaration of policy. It is hereby found and declared that there exist within the City of Holyoke numerous real properties which are in a blighted and/or vacant condition. Many of theses properties are essentially abandoned. Some are in violation of multiple aspects of state and local building codes and sanitary codes. The owner of record is often a large financial institution located out of state, making enforcement of the code very difficult. These code violations include, among multiple other violations, unoccupied buildings susceptible to vandalism and/or open structures rendering them unsafe and dangerous, yards full of litter and trash, unlocked houses, un-shoveled snow that renders sidewalks impassable, and overgrown grass and bushes. 
The existence of such blighted and vacant properties contributes to the decline of city neighborhoods. It is further found that the existence of such blighted and vacant properties encourage temporary occupancy by transients, drug users and persons engaged in criminal activity; adversely affect the economic well being of the city and the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city; and create significant costs to the city by virtue of the need for constant monitoring and frequent boarding and securing. 
It is further found that many of the blighted or vacant properties can be rehabilitated, reconstructed, demolished and/or reused so as to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing, or commercial facilities, and that such rehabilitation, reconstruction, demolition and/or reuse would eliminate, remedy and prevent the adverse conditions described above. 
(b)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following words, terms and phrases shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

(c)  The commission shall determine within 14 days of the filing of an application for a certificate whether said application involves any exterior architectural features which are within the jurisdiction of the commission. 
(d)  Issuance of certificates. 
(1)  Nonapplicability. If the commission determines that an application for a certificate does not involve any exterior architectural features, or involves an exterior architectural feature which is not subject to review by the commission under the provisions of this chapter, the commission shall forthwith issue a certificate of nonapplicability.

(3)  Waiver of public hearing. A public hearing on an application for a certificate need not be held if such hearing is waived in writing by all persons entitled to notice thereof. In addition, a public hearing on an application for a certificate may be waived by the commission if the commission determined that the exterior architectural feature involved, or its category, is so insubstantial in its effect on the district that it may be reviewed by the commission without a public hearing. If the commission dispenses with a public hearing on an application for a certificate, notice of such application shall be given to the owners of all adjoining property and of other property deemed by the commission to be materially affected thereby as above provided, and ten days shall elapse after the mailing of such notice before the commission may act upon such an application.

b.  If the construction or alteration for which an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been filed shall be determined to be inappropriate and therefore disapproved, or in the event of an application for a certificate of hardship, the commission shall further determine whether owing to conditions especially affecting the building or structure involved, but not affecting the district generally, failure to approve an application will involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant and whether such application may be approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this bylaw. If the commission determines that owing to such conditions failure to approve an application will involve substantial hardship to the applicant and approval thereof may be made without such substantial detriment or derogation, the commission shall issue a certificate of hardship. 
c.  In the case of a disapproval of an application for a certificate, the commission must include in its disapproval specific recommendations for changes in the applicant's proposal with respect to the appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material and similar features. Prior to the issuance of any disapproval, the commission shall notify the applicant of its proposed action, accompanied by recommendations of changes in the applicant's proposal, which, if made and filed with the commission would make the application acceptable to the commission. If within 14 days of the receipt of such a notice the applicant files a written modification of his application in conformity with the recommended changes of the commission, the commission shall cause a certificate of appropriateness to be issued to the applicant. 
d.  If the commission should fail to issue a certificate or disapproval within 60 days of the filing of the application for a certificate, or within such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the commission shall thereupon issue a certificate of hardship due to failure to act. 
(e)  The majority vote of the commission shall be required to issue a certificate.

The finding of the person or persons making such review shall be filed with the city clerk within 45 days after the request, and shall be mailed to the applicant and the commission. Said finding shall be binding on the applicant and the commission unless a further appeal is sought in the superior court as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 40C, § 12A.

Sec. 38-76. - Purpose and authority. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Holyoke by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment. 
(b)  The objectives of this section are: 
(1)  Establish regulations for land development activities that preserve the health of water resources by reducing the adverse impacts to water quality by or as a result of stormwater discharges to rivers, lakes, reservoirs and streams in order to attain federal water quality standards; 
(2)  Require that new development, redevelopment and all land conversion activities maintain the natural hydrologic characteristics of the land in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, siltation, property damage and the integrity of aquatic habitats and stream channels; 
(3)  Prevent the discharge of pollutants, including hazardous chemicals, into stormwater runoff; 
(4)  Minimize the volume and rate of stormwater which is discharged, to rivers, streams, reservoirs, lakes and combined sewers that flow from any site during construction and following development, and reduce stream channel erosion caused by increased runoff; 
(5)  Promote proper management of land to minimize the impacts of erosion and sedimentation; 
(6)  Require post-development runoff volume and quality to be equivalent to or an improvement on pre-development runoff conditions by reducing runoff volumes, increasing infiltration, and improving runoff water quality; 
(7)  Provide for the recharge of groundwater aquifers and maintain the base flow of streams; 
(8)  Encourage the use of low impact development (LID) practices such as reducing impervious cover, treating and infiltrating stormwater at the source, utilizing environmentally sensitive site design and, the preservation of open space and natural areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
(9)  Provide stormwater facilities that are functional, attractive, maintain the natural integrity of the environment, and are designed to protect public safety; 
(10)  Minimize damage to public and private property from flooding related to stormwater discharges; 
(11)  Require maintenance provisions to ensure the stormwater treatment devices and facilities will continue to function as designed; 
(12)  Establish procedures for the city's review of stormwater management plans, and for the city's inspection of approved stormwater controls; and 
(13)  Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to stormwater discharges. 
(c)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(d)  This article is adopted under authority granted by the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution, the Home Rule statutes, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the federal Clean Water Act, 40 CFR 122.34, and as authorized by the residents of the City of Holyoke at city council meeting dated December 15, 2009.

Sec. 38-77. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and implementation of this article. Additional definitions may be adopted by separate regulation: 
    Clean Water Act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. section 1251 et seq.) as hereinafter amended. 
    Construction activity. Significant disturbance of a site for the purpose of constructing buildings, structures or other areas of impervious surface. 
    Impervious surfaces. Developed areas which prevent the infiltration of water into the soil, including but not limited to buildings, rooftops, pavement and any other material or structure on or above the ground that prevents water from infiltrating the underlying soil. 
    Land development. Any construction activity or land disturbance of a site that is currently in a natural vegetated state or does no contain alteration by manmade activities. 
    Land disturbance. Any land clearing or grading by mechanical means including: excavation, bulldozing, digging or other similar activities. 
    Low impact development (LID). A set of approaches that seeks to mimic a site's pre-development hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate and detain runoff close to its source. Instead of conveying, managing and/or treating stormwater in large, end-of-pipe facilities, LID utilizes small-scale, decentralized practices that infiltrate, treat, evaporate, and transpire rain water and snow melt including bioretention areas, grassed swales, reduced impervious areas, preserve open space, increase development density, and promote lot size, configuration, street design, parking design, and other structural stormwater treatment methods to achieve this end. 
    Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy. The policy issued by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, and as amended, that coordinates the requirements prescribed by state regulations promulgated under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act., M.G.L.A. c. 131 § 40 and Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L.A. c. 21 § 23-56. The policy addresses stormwater impacts through implementation of performance standards to reduce or prevent pollutants from reaching water bodies and to control the quantity of runoff from a site. 
    Owner. Every person or entity who alone, jointly or severally with others: 
(1)  Has legal title to any building, structure or parcel of land; or 
(2)  Has care, charge or control of any building, structure, or parcel of land in any capacity including but not limited to, an agent, executor, executrix, administrator, administratrix, trustee or guardian of the estate of the holder of legal title; or

    Person. Any individual, association, partnership, corporation, company, business, organization, trust, estate, administrative agency, public or quasi-public corporation or body, the commonwealth or political subdivision thereof or the federal government, to the extent permitted by law and agent of such person. 
    Post-development. The state of a site after development-related construction activities are completed. 
    Pre-development. The state of a site prior to development. The pre-development state shall be interpreted as the state of a site at the time of permitting for a development project. 
    Redevelopment. Development of a site that has been previously been altered by the addition of buildings or impervious surfaces. Redevelopment may include alterations to existing infrastructure, demolition and replacement of existing infrastructure, or addition of new infrastructure. For the purposes of this article, development of an agricultural property to an agricultural or any other another use does not constitute a redevelopment, but is instead classified as development of a site that has not been previously developed. 
    Site. The parcel of land being developed, or a designated planning area in which the land development or redevelopment project is located. 
    Stormwater authority. The stormwater authority shall be the board of public works.

The application shall include a description of an alternate form of containerization.

Sec. 78-58. - Complete streets. 
(a)  Vision and purpose . Complete streets prioritizes walkability, bikability, inter-modal transit, traffic calming, and pedestrian-based urban economic development consistent with Holyoke's legacy built environment as the first planned industrial city in the United States; namely a grid street pattern and short, walkable blocks. 
    The goal is to create a connected network of right-of-way facilities accommodating all modes of travel to the maximum practical extent, while recognizing that not all streets will be able to accommodate the needs of all users equally. 
(b)  Definition of complete streets . "Complete streets" are streets designed and operated to enable safe access, along and across a street, for all users of all ages and abilities; including, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation users. 
(c)  Scope of complete streets applicability . 
(1)  All users and all modes . This section is inclusive of all users of all ages, abilities and modes: motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, persons who may use mobility devices such as wheelchairs, public transportation services, freight providers, utilities, and emergency responders. 
(2)  All projects . The planning and design of projects that affect public streets will give due consideration to all roadway users from the on-set of planning and design work. This applies to all roadway projects, including those involving new construction, reconstruction, repaving/rehabilitation or roadway retrofit. Roadway retrofits may include changes in the allocation of right-of-way and pavement space on an existing roadway; for example, the number and use of lanes, changes in lane widths, and/or reconfiguration of on-street parking. When applying for funding and reviewing projects, regardless of funding source, complete street practices and principles will be included, as appropriate, for all projects that affect the public right-of-way. 
(3)  All agencies and all roads . The design of new, rehabilitated or reconstructed facilities should anticipate likely future demand for bicycling, walking, transit, and motorist use and should not preclude the provision of future improvements. The city will coordinate and collaborate with other transportation agencies including; MassDOT, other municipalities, public utilities, public transportation providers, and other users of the public right-of-way, to ensure that the principles and practices of complete streets are embedded within planning, design, construction, and maintenance activities. 
(d)  Exceptions . Bicyclist, pedestrian, transit users and facilities, and their considerations shall be included in street construction, re-construction, re-paving, and rehabilitation projects, except under one or more of the following conditions: 
(1)  The board of public works, in consultation with the city engineer, determines that such facilities would constitute a threat to public health and safety 
(2)  The project involves a roadway that legally prohibits pedestrians and/or bicyclists. 
(3)  The board of public works determines there is insufficient space to safely accommodate new facilities. In this case, the board shall consider alternatives such as lane reduction, lane narrowing, on-street parking reduction or relocation, shoulders, signage, traffic calming, enforcement, or other appropriate accommodations such as a parallel or nearby facility will provide a reasonable level of similar accessibility. 
(4)  The board of public works, the stormwater authority, and, when appropriate, the conservation commission jointly determine that the construction is not practically feasible or cost-effective because of significant or adverse environmental impacts to historic resources, streams, flood plains, remnants of native vegetation, wetlands, steep slopes or other critical areas, or due to impacts on neighboring land uses, including impact from right of way acquisition. 
(e)  Design standards and guidelines . In fulfillment of this complete streets ordinance the city will follow the design manuals, standards and guidelines listed, as applicable, but should be not be precluded from considering innovative or non-traditional design options where a comparable level of safety for users is present or provided: the Massachusetts Project Development & Design Guide (2006), the National Association of City Transportation Officials Urban Bikeway Design Guide, the ITE Designing Walkable Urban Thoroughfares: A Context Sensitive Approach, ITE Recommended Practice report guidelines, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) green book, which provide guidance on basic design controls and achievement of complete streets. 
(f)  Implementation . The city shall view complete streets as integral to everyday transportation decision-making practices and processes to this end, the city will develop implementation strategies including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Development and adoption of street network master plans for walking and bicycling in Holyoke with attention to regional connectivity and linkage to existing and/or planned regional facilities. 
(2)  Ensuring that all initial planning and design studies, health impact assessments, environmental reviews, and other feasibility studies for projects requiring funding from or approval by the city shall: (1) evaluate the effect of the proposed project on safe travel by all users, and (2) identify measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on such travel that are identified. 
(3)  Facilitating regular inter-departmental communication of updated standards, tools, and innovative strategies for implementing and sustaining complete streets goals to keep related city departments apprised of complete streets opportunities within their jurisdiction. These departments shall include; planning and economic development, department of public works, board of health, Holyoke Gas & Electric, Holyoke Water Works, the city council, and other relevant departments, agencies, jurisdictions and/or associations. 
(4)  Supporting local stakeholder efforts to inform and educate the greater Holyoke community about complete streets as well as the rights and responsibilities of all users of all modes of transportation in the city. 
(5)  Supporting the Holyoke Biking & Walking Committee to achieve its goals as laid out in the council order creating the committee, November 19, 2013.

Sec. 86-264. - Issuance or denial. 
(a)  Standards for issuance. The chief of police shall issue a parade or motorcade permit conditioned upon the applicant's written agreement to comply with the terms of such permit unless the chief of police finds that:

(2)  The parade or motorcade is of a size or nature that requires the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the line of movement and the area contiguous thereto that allowing the parade or motorcade would deny reasonable police protection to the city; 
(3)  Such parade or motorcade will interfere with another parade or motorcade for which a permit has been issued. 
(b)  Standards for denial. The chief of police shall deny an application for a parade or motorcade permit and notify the applicant of such denial where:

(14)  That the amplification of sound permitted to be emitted from sound trucks or bull horns, be fixed and not variable; 
(15)  That the parade or motorcade continue to move at a fixed rate of speed and that any willful delay or willful stopping of said parade or motorcade, except when reasonably required for the safe and orderly conduct of the parade or motorcade, shall constitute a violation of the permit; and 
(16)  Such other requirements as are found by the chief of police to be reasonably necessary for the protection of persons or property. 
(b)  All conditions of the permit shall be complied with so far as reasonably practicable. 
(Code 1972, § 11-5(e))

Upon such appeal, the city council may reverse, affirm or modify in any regard the determination of the chief of police. 
(b)  In the event an application is not filed within the required time, as specified in section 86-263, the applicant may request a waiver of such requirement by the city council at its next regular meeting, or at a special meeting which may be called prior thereto by said city council to consider such matter, and the city council, if it finds unusual circumstances and in the exercise of its sound discretion, may waive such requirement. 
(Code 1972, § 11-5(f))

ARTICLE VIII. - PEDESTRIANS 

Sec. 86-291. - Pedestrian ways designated. 
    The streets, or portions thereof, designated in schedule VI, section 86-328, and specifically incorporated in this section, are declared to be pedestrian ways, and all vehicular traffic shall be prohibited on those streets or portions thereof so designated. 
(Code 1972, § 20-85) 
Sec. 86-292. - Crossing roadway generally. 
    Pedestrians shall obey the directions of police officers directing traffic and, whenever there is an officer directing traffic, or a traffic-control signal within 300 feet of a pedestrian, no such pedestrian shall cross a way or roadway except within the limits of the marked crosswalk at the signalized location and as hereinafter provided in this article. For the purpose of this article, a marked crosswalk shall only be construed to be that area of a roadway reserved for pedestrian crossing located between two solid white reflectorized 12-inch pavement markings in rural areas or markings not less than six inches wide in urban areas, such markings or lines being no less than six feet apart. 
(Code 1972, § 20-132) 
Sec. 86-293. - Crossing roadway at traffic-control signal location. 
(a)  At a traffic-control signal location where pedestrian indications are provided but which are shown only upon actuation by means of a pedestrian pushbutton, a pedestrian shall not cross a roadway unless or until the pedestrian-control signal pushbutton has been actuated and then cross only on the proper pedestrian signal indication. At traffic-control signal locations where no pedestrian indication is provided, pedestrians shall cross only on the green indication. If necessary, the green indication shall be actuated by the pedestrian by means of a pushbutton. 
(b)  At a traffic-control signal location, pedestrians shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles of a funeral or other procession or authorized emergency vehicle while in performance of emergency duties regardless of the signal indication given, and they shall not attempt to cross the roadway until such vehicle or procession has passed, at which time pedestrians shall then cross the roadway only as provided in this article. 
(Code 1972, § 20-133) 
Sec. 86-294. - Obedience to traffic-control signals. 
    Traffic-control signal color indications and legends shall have the commands ascribed to them in this section and no other meanings, and every pedestrian shall comply therewith, except when otherwise directed by an officer. 
(1)  Red and yellow or "Walk." Whenever the red and yellow lenses are illuminated together or the single word "WALK" is illuminated, pedestrians facing such indication may proceed across the roadway and in the direction of such signal only. 
(2)  Red alone or "Don't Walk." Whenever the words "DON'T WALK" or any indication other than red and yellow shown together are illuminated in a traffic-control signal where pedestrian indications are provided, pedestrians approaching or facing such indication shall wait on the sidewalk, edge of roadway or in the pedestrian refuge area of a traffic island and shall not enter upon or cross a roadway until the proper indication is illuminated in the traffic-control signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the walk indication shall proceed or return to the nearest sidewalk or safety island on the yellow indication, the red indication or when the words "DON'T WALK" are illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes. 
(3)  Green alone. At traffic-control signal locations where no pedestrian indication is given or provided, pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked crosswalk in the direction of the green indication. 
(4)  Yellow alone, red alone or flashing "Don't Walk." Pedestrians approaching or facing a yellow, red or flashing "DON'T WALK" illuminated indication shall not start to cross a roadway. 
(5)  Flashing red, yellow or green. At any traffic-control signal location where a flashing red, flashing yellow or flashing green indication is being given facing a crosswalk, pedestrians shall actuate, where provided, the pedestrian signal indication and cross the roadway only on the red-yellow or "WALK" indication when such indication is in operation. If no pedestrian signal is provided, pedestrians shall cross within crosswalks with due care. 
(Code 1972, § 20-134) 
Sec. 86-295. - Unnecessary actuation of pedestrian-control signal. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to actuate a pedestrian-control signal unless a crossing of the roadway is intended. 
(Code 1972, § 20-135) 
Sec. 86-296. - Vehicle operators to exercise due care. 
    The provisions of this article shall in no way abrogate the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 90, §§ 14 and 14A, which provide: "Precautions for Safety of Other Travelers" and for the "Protection of Blind Pedestrians Crossing or Attempting to Cross Ways." Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of this article, every operator of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon the roadway and shall give warning by sounding the horn when necessary and shall exercise proper precautions which may become necessary for safe operation. 
(Code 1972, § 20-136) 
Sec. 86-297. - Enforcement. 
    This article shall be enforced by all officers of the city. 
(Code 1972, § 20-137) 
Sec. 86-298. - Exemptions. 
    The provisions of this article governing the use of ways by pedestrians shall not apply to pedestrians actually engaged in work upon a roadway closed to travel or under construction or repair, to municipal, state, federal or public service corporation employees while in the performance of their duties, to officers engaged in the performance of their public duties or to pedestriansacting in an emergency when such emergency necessitates departure from any part of this article. 
(Code 1972, § 20-138) 
Sec. 86-299. - Penalties. 
    Any person who violates the provisions of this article which deal with the proper use of ways by pedestrians shall be punished as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 90, § 18A.

Any use authorized as a principal use by special permit may also be authorized as an accessory use by special permit provided such use is customarily incidental to the main or principal building or use of the land. Any use not allowed in the district as a principal use is also prohibited as an accessory use. Accessory uses are permitted only in accordance with lawfully existing principal uses. In all instances where site plan review and approval is required for a principal use, the addition of any new accessory use to the principal use, where such addition exceeds the thresholds established in section 10, shall also require site plan review and approval. Notwithstanding this provision, the following nonresidential accessory uses are permitted.

1.  The accessory building is of historical significance and its conversion to a dwelling unit would result in a preservation of architectural qualities that give it historical significance. 
2.  The dwelling unit will satisfy a desirable local need and its design and appearance will not be injurious to the establishment or future character of the vicinity and the neighborhood. 
3.  The conversion will not be deleterious to use and enjoyment of surrounding properties. 
4.  Dimensional controls: The accessory building to be converted to a dwelling unit is at least two stories in height and contains a minimum of 1,000 square feet. 
5.  Overall design standards: The dwelling unit shall be an integral part of the premises and have convenient access to and from adjacent uses and blocks. The dwelling unit shall be related to the principal building in design, materials, and placement to provide a visually and physically integrated lot. The dwelling unit shall be accessible to emergency vehicles. The location of the dwelling unit will not interfere with existing privacy between adjacent buildings. 
6.  Landscaping design standards: Landscape treatment for the dwelling unit shall be part of an integrated landscape design for the entire lot. 
7.  Other conditions: The city council may prescribe such further conditions with respect to the conversion of an accessory building to a dwelling unit as it deems appropriate. 
    4.4.4 ATM as an accessory structure. In the case that an ATM is free-standing, the following considerations shall be made: 
1.  The ATM shall not be situated so as to cause vehicles to queue onto adjacent roads while awaiting service. 
2.  The ATM shall be provided with three parking spaces, except where such ATM location is designed to serve only customers in vehicles. Such parking spaces shall not include parking spaces assigned to other principal uses on the same or adjacent lots. 
3.  The traffic circulation pattern for the ATM shall not interfere with parking spaces or parking lot aisles designated for other uses on the same or adjacent lots.

    4.4.9 Accessory to scientific research. The provisions of this section shall not apply to accessory uses which are necessary in connection with scientific research, scientific development or related production activities, whether or not on the same premises as the principal use and only if such uses are accessory to principal uses permitted as a matter of right. Such accessory use may only be allowed by special permit of the city council and only after it is determined that the proposed accessory use does not substantially derogate from the public good. All general requirements for the granting of a special permit shall apply in these cases.

4-6. - Fences. 
    4.6.1 Setback.

    4.6.3.1 Artificial foundations: Where a fence is placed atop any other manmade feature such as a retaining wall, berm, or foundation, the height of such structure above the surrounding (natural) grade shall be considered as part of the total height of the fence. 
    4.6.3.2 Special permit to exceed fence height. A special permit may be granted by the planning board to exceed the height of a fence in the following instances where the board finds that: 
 The fence is necessary for safety, security or shielding of one property from an adjacent, unlike use 
 Planting materials such as hedges or shrubbery are not adequate or possible 
 The fence shall not impair sight distance of vehicular, pedestrian or other traffic 
 The proposed fence is of a material that is of durable construction 
 The proposed fence is of a design and material that harmonizes with the surrounding neighborhood 
(A)  Industrial properties: In the case of industrial properties in IP, IG, and WM zones, fencing height may be increased to a maximum of eight feet on any side if found necessary to shield the property from neighboring properties as well as for security purposes. 
(B)  Commercial properties: In the case of commercial properties, when the property abuts a residential property fence height may be increased to a maximum of eight feet along the side and rear yards only. For the security of outdoor display and storage, fence height may be increased to a maximum of eight feet on all sides. 
(C)  Multifamily (four family and above) residential/institutional properties: When the property abuts an unlike property, fence height may be increased to a maximum of eight feet when found necessary to shield that property from the neighboring properties. 
(D)  Abutting properties: A property abutting an unlike property that is eligible to apply for a special permit to exceed fence height shall also be eligible to apply for a special permit in accordance with the criteria set forth herein. 
    4.6.3.3. Exemptions 
(A)  Where state or federal law requires a minimum fence height in excess of those permitted by right under this section, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or require a special permit for such a fence. 
(B)  Dumpster enclosures: Dumpster enclosures shall shield the dumpster from sight and shall be at least as tall as the dumpster.

    4.6.4.3 Antipersonnel wire prohibited. No person shall install a fence in whole or in part, using razor, barbed, concertina wire or tape, or other substantially similar materials of whatever name, manufacturer or commercial designation. Where state or federal law requires use of such fencing, nothing in this statute shall be construed so as to prohibit such required fencing materials.

    This zoning ordinance shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 5 at which this zoning ordinance, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and structures may continue, provided that no modification of the use or structure is accomplished, unless authorized hereunder. 
    4.7.2 Nonconforming uses. The city council may award a special permit to change a nonconforming use in accordance with this section only if it determines that such change or extension shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the city council: 
1.  Change or substantial extension of the use; 
2.  Change from one nonconforming use to another, less detrimental, nonconforming use. 
    4.7.3 Nonconforming structures, other than single- and two-family structures. The city council may award a special permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or change a nonconforming structure in accordance with this section only if it determines that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming structures may be considered by the city council: 
1.  Reconstructed, extended or structurally changed; 
2.  Altered to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent. 
    4.7.4 Variance required. The reconstruction, extension or structural change of such nonconforming structures so as to increase an existing nonconformity, or create a new nonconformity, including the extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a required yard, shall require the issuance of a variance from the board of appeals. 
    4.7.5 Nonconforming single- and two-family structures. Nonconforming single- and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the building commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure, and the issuance of a building permit, where applicable. In the event that the building commissioner determines that the nonconforming nature of such structure would be increased by the proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the city council may, by special permit, allow such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change where it determines that the proposed modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. 
    4.7.6 Abandonment or nonuse. Except as otherwise provided herein, a nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions of this zoning ordinance. 
    4.7.7 Reversion to nonconformity. No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use, revert from a nonconforming use.

SECTION 6. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 

6-1. - Off-street parking. 
    6.1.1 Basic requirements. There shall be provided, at the time any building or structure or part thereof is erected, off-street parking spaces for automobiles, on the premises or on nearby premises, in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. If the use or intensity of use of a building or structure erected on or after the effective date of this ordinance is changed to another use or increased in intensity in a manner requiring more off-street parking than required for the original use, additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided to conform to this section. Except in the case of dwellings, no parking area provided hereinafter shall be established for less than three spaces. 
    6.1.2 Size and access. Each off-street space shall be at least nine feet in width by 18 feet in length in size exclusive of access and drives or aisles and shall be of usable shape and condition. Access to every required space shall be provided by at least one aisle of sufficient width to insure free movement in and out of the space. Where a parking lot does not abut a public way, alley or easement of access, there shall be provided at least one access drive not less than ten feet in width in the case of dwellings, and not less than 14 feet in width in all other cases, leading to the parking areas required hereunder in the most appropriate manner. Such access drive shall not be located in any residence district if the drive provides access to uses other than those permitted in the residence district. Access points to off-street parking areas shall be limited to well-defined locations, and in no case shall there be permitted unrestricted access (such as continuous curb cuts along the length of the street or alley upon which the parking area abuts). 
    6.1.3 Form of parking space; setbacks. Where a required off-street parking space is in the form of a private garage its location on the lot shall be as provided in section 4, in accordance with the regulations governing accessory uses. Where a required off-street parking space is in the form of a parking lot or other open air parking space, it shall not be located within five feet of a street line or within five feet of any other lot line. Greater setbacks may be required in specific instances elsewhere in this ordinance. 
    6.1.4 Number of spaces required. Minimum standards for the provision of off-street parking spaces are set forth in the schedule below. In the case of uses not specifically enumerated herein, the provisions for the use most similar shall apply. The building commissioner is hereby authorized to establish reasonable off-street parking requirements in accordance with the spirit of these regulations for uses not specifically covered in the schedule. 
    6.1.5 Joint use. Off-street parking spaces for business or industrial uses may be provided to jointly serve two or more buildings or uses, provided that the total spaces in such a joint parking area shall not be fewer than would be required in the schedule, above, if the buildings or uses were separate. 
    6.1.6 Multipurpose buildings. In the case of a building or structure to be devoted to more than one kind of use, the off-street parking spaces provided shall equal the total number which would be required in the schedule, below, if the uses were to be conducted in separate buildings. 
    6.1.7 Special permit for reduction of parking requirements. The planning board may grant a special permit to reduce otherwise applicable requirements for parking where the Board finds that the reduction is not inconsistent with public health and safety, or that the reduction promotes a public benefit. Such cases might include: 
1.  Use of a common parking lot for separate uses having peak demands occurring at different times; 
2.  Age or other characteristics of occupants of the facility requiring parking which reduces auto usage;

2. Net floor space shall mean the total area of the building less space devoted to hallways, stairwells, utility areas and storage. 
3. Gross floor space shall mean the total area of the building without subtracting the space devoted to hallways, stairwells, utility areas and storage. 
4. Where the building commissioner determines the required off-street parking, he or she shall use the nearest comparable use in making such determination. 
    6.1.7.1 Special permit for parking on adjacent or nearby parcel (downtown zones). 
    6.1.7.2 Purpose . The purpose of special permit for parking is to allow a principal use in the downtown to meet the off-street parking standards set forth herein and to protect the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the city by providing a mechanism to review plans for such lots and ensure that their development is in a manner that reasonably protects the visual and environmental qualities of the site and neighboring properties. The planning board may grant a special permit to allow parking as an accessory use on an adjacent or nearby parcel in accordance with the following: 
    6.1.7.3 Criteria. 
1.  The parcel on which the principal use is located ("principal parcel") and the parcel upon which the accessory parking is proposed ("accessory parcel") must be located in a DR, IG or BC zone. 
2.  The applicant must provide documentation that they cannot otherwise provide parking on the principal parcel, including, but not limited to, plans, drawings, and diagrams. 
3.  The accessory parcel must be adjacent to or directly across the street from the principal parcel and both parcels must be under common ownership and used solely by the primary owner. 
4.  The maximum number of parking spaces allowed on the accessory parcel(s) shall be the difference between the number of spaces required to be provided for the principal use in accordance with the table of off-street parking standards set forth herein, and the number of spaces provided on the principal parcel(s). In no event shall number of parking spaces authorized by special permit result in a total number of spaces that is greater than the number required by this appendix on both the principal and accessory parcels 
5.  The special permit shall be nontransferable, unless both the principal parcel and the accessory parcel are sold together to a new owner and the same use will continue on the principal parcel. In the event of a change of use of the principal parcel, the special permit shall be reviewed by the planning board for potential amendment. 
6.  As a condition of the special permit, the streetscape along the accessory parcel shall be improved with the inclusion of features such as trees, a green belt, or other similar features that will improve the streetscape and promote pedestrian access between the principal and accessory parcel. 
7.  The accessory parking allowed by a special permit under this section shall comply with all other requirements for off-street parking set forth herein.

Editor's note- Ord. of 11-18-08 [86th amd.], § 1, deleted the former § 7-4, §§ 7.4.1-7.4.8, and enacted a new § 7-4 as set out herein. The former § 7-4 pertained to multifamily dwellings and derived from Ord. of 2-19-02 [45th amd.], § 7.0. 
7-5. - Flexible development. 
    7.5.1 Purpose. The purposes of this section, flexible development, are: 
1.  To encourage the preservation of open land for its scenic beauty and to enhance agricultural, open space, forestry, and recreational use. 
2.  To preserve historical and archeological resources; to protect the natural environment, including Holyoke's varied landscapes and water resources. 
3.  To protect the value of real property. 
4.  To promote more sensitive siting of buildings and better overall site planning. 
5.  To perpetuate the appearance of Holyoke's traditional New England landscape. 
6.  To facilitate the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities, and public services in a more economical and efficient manner. 
7.  To offer an alternative to standard subdivision development. 
    7.5.2 Applicability. In accordance with the following provisions, a flexible development project may be created, whether a subdivision or not, from any parcel or set of contiguous parcels held in common ownership and located entirely within the city. Proposed parcel shall be equipped with public water supply in order to receive a density bonus. 
    7.5.3 Procedures. Flexible development may be authorized upon the issuance of a special permit by the planning board. Applicants for flexible development shall file with the planning board the information required by section 9-3. Applicants who anticipate filing a special permit shall file with the planning board according to section 10 of this ordinance regarding site plan review. Additional information shall include: 
1.  Boundaries of areas regulated by the Holyoke Conservation Commission under MGL, c131, Ch. 40. 
2.  Location and limits of soil types consistent with the soils classification maps prepared by the US Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service. 
3.  The extent of any primary and secondary aquifers underlying the site, as currently shown on maps prepared by the City Of Holyoke. 
4.  Topographic contours at intervals of ten feet or less. 
5.  Delineation of slopes of 20 percent or greater. 
6.  The location of cultural and historic features including but not limited to stonewalls on the boundary of the site, archeological and historic sites and structures, and significant trees (caliper of 30 inches or more at the base). On sites of more than 20 acres, interior stone walls shall be shown. 
7.  The boundaries of the secondary watershed areas in which the site is located. 
8.  Scenic viewsheds as identified by on-site observations from public roads and vantage points. 
    7.5.4 Design process. Each development plan shall follow the design process outlined below. When the development plan is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the planning board that this design process was considered in determining the layout of proposed streets, house lots, and common open space. 
1.  Understanding the site. The first step is to inventory existing site features, taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic and cultural resources on the site, and to determine the connection of these important features to each other. 
2.  Evaluating site context. The second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context by identifying physical (e.g., stream corridors, wetlands), transportation (e.g., road and bicycle networks), and cultural (e.g., recreational opportunities) connections to surrounding land uses and activities. 
3.  Designating the common open space. The third step is to identify the common open space to be preserved on the site. Such open space should include the most sensitive and noteworthy resources of the site, and, where appropriate, areas that serve to extend neighborhood open space networks. 
4.  Location of development areas. The fourth step is to locate building sites, streets, parking areas, paths and other built features of the development. The design should include a delineation of private yards, public streets and other areas, and shared amenities, so as to reflect an integrated community, with emphasis on consistency with historical development patterns. 
5.  Lot lines. The final step is simply to draw in the lot lines (if applicable). 
    7.5.5 Modification of lot requirements. The planning board encourages applicants for flexible development to modify lot size, shape, and other dimensional requirements for lots within a flexible development to create a building site which is in harmony with the natural features of the site, subject to the following limitations: 
1.  Lots having reduced area or frontage shall not have frontage on a street other than a street created by the flexible development; provided, however, that the planning board may waive this requirement where it is determined that such reduced lot(s) are consistent with existing development patterns in the neighborhood. 
    7.5.6 Number of dwelling units. Units shall be allowed as follows: 
1.  Basic maximum number. The basic maximum number of dwelling units allowed in a flexible development shall not exceed the number of lots which could reasonably be expected to be developed upon the site under a conventional plan in full conformance with all zoning, subdivision regulations, health regulations, wetlands regulations and other applicable requirements. The proponent shall have the burden of proof with regard to the design and engineering specifications for such conventional plan. 
2.  Density bonus. The planning board may award a density bonus to increase the number of dwelling units beyond the basic maximum number. The density bonus for the flexible development shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of the basic maximum number. All dwelling units awarded as a density bonus shall be two bedroom units. Computations shall be rounded to the lowest number. A density bonus may be awarded in the following circumstances: 
a.  For each additional ten percent of the site (over and above the required 30 percent) set aside as common open space, a density bonus of one additional unit may be awarded; provided, however, that this density bonus shall not exceed 50 percent of the basic maximum number. 
    7.5.7 Site design standards. 
1.  Buildings. The flexible development may consist of single family detached and/or zero lot line residential structures. The following criteria shall apply: 
a.  Residential structures shall be oriented toward the street serving the premises and not the required parking area. 
b.  Lots shall be laid out and designed, to the greatest extent feasible, to preserve and protect historic and archeological sites, farmland, wooded stream corridors, forested areas and large trees, scenic views particularly as seen from public roads, ridgelines and hilltops. 
2.  Roads. The principal roadway(s) serving the site shall be designed to conform with the standards of the city where the roadway is or may be ultimately intended for dedication and acceptance by the city. Private ways shall be adequate for the intended use and vehicular traffic and shall be maintained by an association of unit owners or by the applicant. 
3.  Parking. Each dwelling unit shall be served by two off-street parking spaces. Parking spaces in front of garages may count in this computation. 
4.  Common open space. A minimum of 30 percent of the parcel shown on the development plan shall be common open space. Any proposed common open space, unless conveyed to the city or its conservation commission, shall be subject to a recorded restriction enforceable by the city, providing that such land shall be perpetually kept in an open state, that it shall be preserved for exclusively agricultural, horticultural, educational or recreational purposes, and that it shall be maintained in a manner which will ensure its suitability for its intended purposes. 
a.  The percentage of the common open space which is wetlands shall not normally exceed the percentage of the tract which is wetlands; provided, however, that the applicant may include a greater percentage of wetlands in such open space upon a demonstration that such inclusion promotes the purposes set forth in subsection 1, above. In no case shall the percentage of common open space which is wetlands exceed 50 percent of the tract. 
b.  At least 70 percent of the common open space shall be retained in contiguous areas, unless less is approved by the planning board. 
c.  The common open space shall be used for conservation, historic preservation and education, outdoor education, recreation, park purposes, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or for a combination of these uses, and shall be served by suitable access for such purposes. 
d.  The maximum number of house lots compatible with good design shall abut the open space and all house lots shall have reasonable physical and visual access to the open space through internal roads, sidewalks or paths. An exception may be made for resource areas vulnerable to trampling or other disturbance. 
e.  The common open space shall have a shape, dimension, character, and location suitable to assure its use for park, recreation, conservation or agricultural purposes by at least all of the residents of the tract. 
f.  Open space areas may not be excavated or filled and must be maintained in their natural state. 
g.  Further subdivision of the common open space or its use other than recreation, conservation, forest or agriculture, except for easements for underground utilities or drinking water supply wells, shall be prohibited. 
h.  Structures or buildings accessory to recreation, conservation, or agriculture use may be erected but shall not exceed five percent coverage of such common space. 
5.  Ownership of the contiguous open space. The contiguous open space shall, at the planning board's election, be conveyed to: 
a.  The city or its conservation commission. 
b.  A nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space and any of the purposes for such open space set forth above. 
c.  A corporation or trust owned jointly or in common by the owners of lots within the flexible development. If such corporation or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with conveyance of the lots in perpetuity. Maintenance of such open space and facilities shall be permanently guaranteed by such corporation or trust which shall provide for mandatory assessments for maintenance expenses to each lot. Each such trust or corporation shall be deemed to have assented to allow the city to perform maintenance of such open space and facilities, if the trust or corporation fails to provide adequate maintenance, and shall grant the city an easement for this purpose. In such event, the city shall first provide 14 days' written notice to the trust or corporation as to the inadequate maintenance, and, if the trust or corporation fails to complete such maintenance, the city may perform it. Each individual deed, and the deed or trust or articles of incorporation, shall include provisions designed to effect these provisions. Documents creating such trust or corporation shall be submitted to the planning board for approval, and shall thereafter be recorded. Such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open space by sale or otherwise (except to an organization conceived and organized to own and maintain the common open space), without first offering to dedicate the same land to the city. 
6.  Buffer areas. A buffer area of 50 feet shall be provided at the perimeter of the property where it abuts residentially zoned or occupied properties, except for driveways necessary for access and egress to and from the site. No vegetation in this buffer area will be disturbed, destroyed or removed, except for normal maintenance. The planning board may waive the buffer requirement (i) where the land abutting the site is held by the city for conservation or recreation purposes; or (ii) the planning board determines that a smaller buffer will suffice to accomplish the objectives set forth herein. 
7.  Drainage. Stormwater management shall be consistent with the requirements for subdivisions set forth in the rules and regulations of the planning board. The planning board shall encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management techniques and other drainage systems that reduce impervious surfaces and enable infiltration where appropriate. Stormwater management systems serving the flexible development may be located within the required common open space. Surface systems, such as retention and detention ponds, shall not qualify towards the minimum open space requirement. 
    7.5.8 Decision. The planning board may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a flexible development after determining whether the flexible development better promotes the purposes of this flexible development ordinance than would a conventional subdivision development of the same locus. 
1.  Relation to other requirements. The submittals and permits of this section shall be in addition to any other requirements of the subdivision control law or any other provisions of this zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02 [45th amd.], § 7.0) 
7-6. - Planned unit development. 
    7.6.1 Purpose. The planned unit development, in addition to furthering the general purpose of this ordinance, is intended to provide for a mixture of housing types in the RA, R-1, R-1A, R-2 and RM-20 districts at somewhat greater densities than would normally be allowed in order to promote objectives of better diversity, livability and aesthetic quality in the living environment.

2.  Treatment of the sides and rear of all buildings within the planned development group shall be comparable in amenity and appearance to the treatment given to street frontages of these same buildings. The design of buildings and their ancillary facilities shall take advantage of the topography of the site wherever possible. 
3.  All buildings shall be arranged as to avoid undue exposure to concentrated loading or parking facilities wherever possible and shall be so oriented as to preserve visual and audible privacy between adjacent buildings. All buildings shall be arranged as to be accessible to emergency vehicles. 
4.  Landscape design standards. Landscape treatment for plazas, drives, walkways, service and parking areas shall be designed as an integral part of a coordinated landscape design for the entire project area. Landscape materials selected shall be appropriate to the growing conditions of the city's environment. Whenever appropriate, existing vegetal cover shall be conserved and integrated into the landscape design. Planting exotic invasive species shall not be allowed. 
5.  Circulation design standards. Roads, drives, pedestrian walks and open space shall be designed as an integral part of an overall site design, and shall be properly related to proposed buildings and topography. Buildings and vehicular circulation spaces shall be arranged so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic. Landscaped, paved and comfortably graded pedestrian walks shall be provided along the lines of the most intense use, particularly from building entrances to streets, parking areas and adjacent buildings. Maximum separation of private automobiles and service vehicles shall be insured through the use of separate service areas. 
6.  Conveyance and maintenance of common open space. All land shown on the definitive development plan as common open space shall be conveyed under one of the following options: Conveyance may be to a public agency which agrees to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures, or improvements which have been placed on it; or conveyance may be to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association or similar organization for the maintenance of the open space and other common property in the planned development. (The common open space must be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be approved by the planning board which restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the final development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a manner which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one of the following methods of enforcement must be provided: The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not specified in the final development plan must be conveyed to a public agency; or the restrictions governing the use, improvement, and maintenance of the common open space must be stated as conditions to the conveyance of the common open space, the fee title to the common open space to vest in a public agency in the event of a substantial default in the stated conditions. If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, the covenants governing the use, improvement, and maintenance of the common open space may authorize a public agency to enforce their provisions. Common open space shall be contiguous to other open space to the extent feasible. 
    7.6.6 Procedural requirements. The following procedures shall be required for the presentation of a planned unit development proposal: 
1.  Preapplication conference. Before submitting an application for a special permit for a planned unit development, an applicant, at his option, may confer with the planning department to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys, and other data. 
2.  Application for special permit, outline plan. Each application for a planned unit development shall be accompanied by an outline, or preliminary plan in triplicate, of the entire tract under consideration, prepared in accordance with the specifications of the subdivision regulations of the planning board for preliminary subdivision plans (whether or not all of the development constitutes a subdivision as defined in the Subdivision Control Law, M.G.L.A. c. 41, §§ 81K-81GG, inclusive). Within ten days after receipt of the plan, the city council shall transmit a copy thereof to the planning board. The planning board shall investigate the proposed layout and report, in writing, its recommendations to the city council. The city council shall not take final action until it has received a report from the planning board or until the planning board has allowed 60 days to elapse after receipt of such plan without rendering a report. 
3.  A special permit for a planned unit development, issued by the city council, shall be deemed to be authorization to develop the tract according to the special use regulations and dimensional controls set forth herein. A favorable recommendation by the planning board that a special permit be issued, shall not be deemed to constitute final approval of the development nor any part thereof. 
4.  Design control, definitive plan. After issuance of a special permit for a planned unit development, the execution of the project, in accordance with the standards set forth herein, shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed for a subdivision, as contained in the subdivision rules and regulations of the planning board. Said procedures shall apply whether or not all of the development constitutes a subdivision (as defined in the Subdivision Control Law, M.G.L.A. c. 41, §§ 81K-81GG, inclusive). 
5.  There shall be submitted to the planning board a definitive development plan of the entire tract, showing, in addition to those elements required for a subdivision definitive plan, the location and type of all buildings, walkways, driveways and parking areas, the topography, the proposed landscape treatment, and the location, extent and design of all areas proposed to be conveyed, dedicated or otherwise reserved for common open space and for schools and other public or semipublic facilities. There shall also be submitted a development schedule, showing the beginning and completion dates for each phase of the project, and the amount of common open space to be provided with each phase. Agreements, provisions or covenants proposed to govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of common areas within the development shall also be submitted. 
6.  The planning board shall hold a public hearing, in accordance with the procedures for hearings under the subdivision control law, on the definitive development plan and its supporting documentation, and shall, within the time limits therein prescribed, approve or disapprove said plan. Those portions of an approved plan which constitute a subdivision within the meaning of the subdivision control law, shall be endorsed after appropriate performance guarantees have been made and after the required appeal period. 
7.  In-progress adjustments. Amendments to the approved definitive plan may be made at any time in the manner prescribed for subdivisions in M.G.L.A. c. 41, § 81W. 
    7.6.7 Adherence to approved plan. In addition to performance guarantees required for those portions of the development which constitute a subdivision, conformance with the definitive plan for the entire development will be insured by continued surveillance by the planning board. Failure to adhere to the approved definitive plan and supporting documentation will, upon recommendation of the planning board, result in suspension of all building permits outstanding until the building commissioner and the planning board are satisfied that the work is proceeding according to said plan and schedule. Continued failure to comply with the approved definitive plan will result in revocation of the special permit for a planned unit development.

8-8. - Downtown residential district (DR). 
    8.8.1 Purpose. The downtown residential district (DR) has been established to encourage infill and redevelopment that is in keeping with the existing neighboring buildings and structures; to permit a flexible approach to redevelopment of larger parcels; to promote a mix of residential and smaller-scale commercial uses in the same building or neighborhood; and to increase property values in downtown residential neighborhoods. 
    8.8.2 Permitted uses. In the DR district, those commercial uses marked "Y" in the table of principal uses shall be permitted as of right; provided, however, that such commercial uses shall be allowed only in conformance with the following conditions: 
1.  Such commercial use shall occupy the first floor only of a building; provided, however, that there shall be at least two dwelling units in the remainder of the building. No such commercial use shall be permitted unless residential uses also exist within the same building. 
2.  The building shall contain not less than three stories, excluding basements and attics. 
    8.8.3 Special permit for nonconforming structures abandoned or not used for more than two years. Notwithstanding the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 6, the city council may grant a special permit authorizing the reconstruction, alteration, or rehabilitation, and occupancy and use of a nonconforming structure that has been abandoned or not used for a period of more than two years. To be eligible for such special permit, the structure must have the following characteristics: 
1.  Masonry construction; 
2.  Architectural or other features deemed appropriate for rehabilitation by the city council. 
    8.8.4 Dimensional regulations. In the DR district, the maximum setback, maximum lot coverage, maximum number of stories, and minimum area per dwelling unit required shall be the average of these features on the nearest five lots containing structures on the same side of the street on the same block. In circumstances where the block is vacant and averaging is not possible, the requirements shall be the following provided, however, that the planning board may vary this requirement by special permit to a greater or lesser number. 
Minimum lot size: 6,000 square feet Minimum setback: 10 feet Minimum frontage: 60 feet Maximum height: 90 feet (7 stories) Maximum density: 60 units/acre  
    8.8.5 Special permit for dimensional variation. In the DR district, the city council may grant a special permit to reduce otherwise applicable requirements for lot area, frontage, width, density, front/side/rear yard, building height, or lot coverage upon a finding that: 
1.  Compliance with such requirements would be impracticable, unreasonable, or undesirable because of: 
a.  The area, width, depth or shape of the lot; or 
b.  The lot coverage or height of existing neighboring structures; or 
c.  The characteristics of buildings situated on nearby properties. 
2.  Such reduction may be accomplished without substantial detriment to the neighborhood; and 
3.  The proposed structure is consistent with the architectural scale and style of those in the immediate area. 
4.  The proposed variation is consistent with Holyoke's traditional downtown neighborhood development pattern(s).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any minimum required amount of parking may be reduced by the PAA through the plan approval process (or, for projects requiring plan review by the city planning department, prior to submission of any application for a building permit), if the applicant can demonstrate that the lesser amount of parking will not cause excessive congestion, endanger public safety, or that lesser amount of parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits, taking into consideration: 
a.  The availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being served and/or the proximity of a bus stop or transit station; 
b.  The availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use being served; 
c.  Shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user demands at different times; 
d.  Age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of auto usage; 
e.  Impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot or the adjacent lots including reduction in green space, destruction of significant existing trees and other vegetation, destruction of existing dwelling units, or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways; and 
f.  Such other factors as may be considered by the PAA or the city planning department. 
4.  Location of parking. Any surface parking lot shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located at the rear or side of a building, relative to any principal street, public open space, or pedestrian way.

    10.1.8 Stormwater management design criteria and standards. All stormwater management measures must comply with the city stormwater and erosion control ordinance. No site plan shall be approved unless the development provides design and management measures necessary to maintain the post development peak discharges for a 24-hour, two-year frequency storm event at a level that is equal to or less than the respective, pre-development peak surcharge rates. When the proposed discharge may have an impact upon a sensitive receptor, including streams, storm drains, combined sewers, roads, and/or buildings, the city engineer may require an increase in these minimum requirements. The plan shall incorporated the following performance standards to accomplish this objective: 
1.  Stormwater management measures. Stormwater management measures shall be required to satisfy the minimum control requirements and shall be according to the following order of preference: 
a.  Low impact development technologies. 
b.  Infiltration, flow attenuation, and pollutant removal of runoff through the use of open vegetated swales, natural depressions or underground systems. 
c.  Detention and evaporation of stormwater on rooftops or in parking lots. 
d.  Use of stormwater on-site to replace water used in industrial processes or for irrigation. 
e.  Stormwater detention structures for the temporary storage of runoff which are designed so as not to create a permanent pool of water. 
f.  Stormwater retention structures for the permanent storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water. 
2.  Low impact development incentives. An applicant that utilizes low impact development best practices as described in the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Guide shall be eligible for the incentives below as determined by the city engineer in accordance with the level of utilization as listed below: 
a.  Waived site plan review application fee for all instances. 
b.  Discounted sewer entrance fee in direct accordance with the amount of stormwater infiltrated using LID best practices. 
c.  Parking reduction by right if such area of reduction is used for area to utilize LID technologies 
    10.1.9 Action by the planning board. Site plan review shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in M.G.L.A. c. 40A for special permits. After determining that the site plan is in conformance with the requirements of this section, and after considering the criteria set forth in subsection 10.1.6, the planning board may approve, approve with modification, or disapprove the site plan application or grant leave to withdraw. Approval may be subject to any conditions, modifications and/or restrictions as the planning board may deem necessary. Leave to withdraw or disapproval by the planning board must be supported by written findings. 
1.  Failure to take action within 90 days following the date of the public hearing shall be deemed to be a grant of site plan approval, and the site plan will be approved. 
2.  The planning board shall file a copy of its decision with the city clerk within 14 days. No approval shall be issued until the 20-day appeal period has lapsed. 
3.  The planning board may require the posting of a bond for public improvements in an amount to be recommended by the city engineer, to assure compliance with the public improvements required by this site plan as approved by the planning board. The amount of the bond shall not exceed the cost of the public improvements. 
    10.1.10 Enforcement, lapse and appeal. The terms and conditions of site plan approval shall be enforced by the building commissioner. Any site plan approval issued under this section shall lapse within two years if a substantial use thereof has not commenced sooner except for good cause. Such extension request shall be submitted to the planning board, in writing, prior to the expiration of said two-year term. The time required to pursue and await determination of a judicial appeal pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 40A shall not be included within the two-year time. 
1.  Appeal. Persons aggrieved by the action of the planning board pursuant to this section 10.0 shall appeal in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 40A § 17.

and establish a new date for the completion of
said required improvements. Failure of the developer
to complete the improvements within said two ( 2)
year period, or a:ny extension thereof, shall not
relieve the developer from his obligation to pay

less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet should
be avoided. Streets and ways should be continuous and
in alignment with existing streets as far as practicable.
(5) The minimum centerline radii of curved streets and ways
shall be one hundred (100) feet. Greater radii may be
required for principal streets (arterials and collectors),
to provide safe vehicular travel, unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Board.
(6) Streets and ways shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles. No street or way shall
intersect any other street or way at less than sixty (60)

Lots which are so distorted in configuration as to be detrimental to
public health, safety, welfare or convenience even though complying with
the dimensional requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, shall not be
allowed. The mean direction of side lot lines shall be as close as
possible to perpendicular to the street line or to its tangent at
the point of intersection of the side lot line. In no case shall the
.mean direction of the side lot line form an angle of less than
seventy-five (75) degrees with the street line or the aforesaid tangent.
6 .6 LOTS OF ABOOHMAL SIZ~
In a subdivision, in case a tract is subdivided into parcels larger
than normal building lots, the Planning aoard may decline to approve
the plan unless such parcels are arranEed so as to allow the opening
of proper future streets and ways, and lo~ical and proper subdivisions
or developments.
6. 7 OPBN SPACi AND NATUli.AL FUTUitZS
iiefore approval of a plan if the Plannine; i3oard shall find it appropriate,
it may require the plan to Ghnw a park or parks, suitably located for
playground or recreation purposes, for providin~ liGht and air and not
unreasonable in area in relation to the area of land being subdivided
or developed and the prospective uses of such land. If so determined
the PlanninG i1oard shall by appropriate endorsement on the plan require
that no buildin[!; may be erected on such park or parks for a period of
not more than three years without its approval. It is also recommended
that due reG;ard be shown for all natural features, such as large trees,
water courses, scenic points, historic spots and similar community

6.8 OPEN SPACE REgurREMENTS IN A DEVELOPMENT
~i'~< .
In RM-20, RM-40 and RM-60.¢oning districts, at least half of the
. . r ..
lot area not covered by buildings shall be devoted to recreational
facilities and landscaped areas for the enjoyment of the residents.
Such facilities and recreation areas shall be thoroughly intergrated
with the overall site design and exhibit practical usefulness
and aesthetic considerations. The design shall clearly show the
incorporation of at least the specific minimum areas described
herein as part of this open space requirement. In order to allow
for the flexibility necessary to insure desirable residential
development, the Planning Board may waive strict compliance and
permit adjustments between or among the three categories of open
space areas, when the amenities of a site would best be recognized,
and where the intent of the open space development requirement
would better be served.
6.8.1 Types of Areas
(1) Playlot:
This type area is intended to essentially substitute
for backyards. It should be well defined, contained,
centrally located, and accessible from residential
buildings without crossing vehicular ways or parking
areas. Where the total playlot area requirements for
the entire site would exceed the indicated maximum size,
multiple areas shall be developed. (2) Active Area: '
This type area is intended to afford an opportunity for
a variety of active outdoor sports. Such an area shall ~·
., _;_.~·. ,,- .
be located with regard to. re~al buildlna~, vehic;ul~.
6-7
level, slightly pitched, (maximum 3%), grassed, paved,
or a combination thereof, and rectangularly shaped
(the shorter side of which shall be not less than SO%
of the longer side), so as to provide an area usable
for most common outdoor games. Where the ~agnLtude of
development requires, several such areas shall b~
developed at different locations throughout the site.
(3) Passive Area:
This type area shall be blended generally into the overall
site design, and massed at appropriate locations to
provide for quiet, passive recreation. Such areas shall
contain, and be defined by, landforms and vegetation,
and be located with regard to other activities, buildings,
vehicular ways, and parking areas.
