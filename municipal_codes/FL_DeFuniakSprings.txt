PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of DeFuniak Springs of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1903 Revised Ordinances and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1903 Revised Ordinances and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixth section of chapter 7 is 7-6. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-4 and 6-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-4.1, 6-4.2 and 6-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Sec. 8-42. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  Pursuant to Article VIII, section 1(g) of the Florida Constitution, sections 166.021 and 166.041, Florida Statutes, the city council has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions, except when prohibited by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances. 
(2)  The council specifically finds that the city fire rescue system benefits all residents and businesses within the city and, therefore, the fire impact fee shall be imposed on all fire impact construction in all incorporated areas of the city. 
(3)  Development and redevelopment necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan and the impact fee study adopted in section 8-44 will require improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system to accommodate the new development generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service provided by the city. 
(4)  Future growth, as represented by impact construction, should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system that are required to accommodate the impact generated by such growth. 
(5)  The required improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system needed to eliminate any deficiencies shall be financed by revenue sources of the city other than impact fees. 
(6)  Implementation of the impact fees to require impact construction within the city to contribute its fair share to the cost of required capital improvements is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management of the city. 
(7)  The council expressly finds that the improvements and additions to the city fire rescue system to be funded by the fire impact fee provide a benefit to all impact construction within the city that is in excess of the actual impact fees. 
(8)  The purpose of this article is to regulate the development of land within the city by requiring payment of impact fees by impact construction and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the city fire rescue system which are required to accommodate such growth. This article shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the city fire rescue system generated by such applicable impact construction. 
(9)  The data set forth in the fire rescue impact fee study which were employed in the calculation of the impact fee rates imposed herein is the most recent and localized data available for the city fire rescue system. 
(10)  The administrative fees set forth herein constitute the city's actual costs for collection of the impact fee including the actual costs related to the administration and the collection process.

(Ord. No. 751, Art. IV, § 4.01, 8-13-2007) 
Sec. 8-92. - Changes of size and use. 
    A fire impact fee shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory use or structure if the alteration, expansion or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory use or structure results in a land use determined to generate greater impact than the present use under the applicable impact fee rate schedules adopted in section 8-71, as applicable. The impact fee imposed shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  If the impact fee is calculated on a per dwelling unit basis and not on the basis of square footage, the impact fee imposed shall be the amount due under the applicable impact fee rate schedule for the impact fee land use category resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less the impact fee that would have been imposed under the applicable impact fee rate schedule for the impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(2)  If the impact fee is calculated on the basis of square footage, in the event the square footage of a building is increased, the impact fee due for the increased square footage represented by the impact construction shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due according to the square footage resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less the impact fee that would have been imposed for the original square footage prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(3)  If the use of a building is changed after payment of the impact fee which results in a change in the applicable impact fee land use category of the building and such change is determined to generate a greater impact than the present use, the additional impact fee due for the change in use shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due according to the square footage of the building under the new impact fee land use category less the impact fee that was imposed for the square footage of the building under the original impact fee land use category. 
(4)  If an impact fee is imposed for an accessory building or structure because such accessory use or structure is determined to generate a greater impact than the present use, the fee shall be that applicable to the impact fee land use category for the primary building.

If the appraisal does not conform to the requirements of this article and the applicable administrative regulations, the appraisal shall be corrected and resubmitted. In the event the impact fee coordinator accepts the methodology of the appraisal but disagrees with the appraised value, he may engage another M.A.I. appraiser at the city's expense and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two (2) appraisals. If either party does not accept the average of the two (2) appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of said third appraisal being shared equally by the city and the owner or applicant. The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two (2) appraisers and the third appraisal shall be binding on the parties.

In the event the applicant or owner fails to convey the property which is the subject of the donation to the city or such property is not ultimately accepted by the city in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, then the credit for donation shall be revoked and all impact fees shall immediately become due and payable. The administration of said contribution credits shall be the responsibility of the impact fee coordinator. 
(i)  Any applicant or owner who submits a proposed plan pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a certificate of occupancy prior to approval of the proposed plan shall pay prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy the applicable impact fees pursuant to section 8-71 hereof. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, should the impact fee coordinator approve and accept the proposed plan, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner.

Sec. 12-32. - Purchase. 
(a)  Except as provided below or as otherwise exempted by section 12-34, there is hereby levied and imposed by the city on each and every purchase of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural liquefied petroleum gas or manufactured gas), fuel oil, and water service, within the corporate limits of the city, a tax at the rate of ten (10) percent of the total amount charged for such utility service or commodity. For purposes of calculating the tax, the amount charged for the taxable service shall be deemed to include any gross receipts taxes and franchise fees separately stated on the customer's bill. 
(b)  The tax imposed by this section shall not be applied against any fuel adjustment charge, and such charge shall be separately stated on each bill.

(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 12-33. - Collection. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural or manufactured), fuel oil or water service to collect from the purchaser for the use of the city the tax levied by the preceding section, at the time of collecting the selling price charged for each transaction and to file a return and remit on or before the twentieth day of each calendar month, or if the twentieth day is either a legal holiday or is not a city business day, then on or before the first city business day, that is not also a legal holiday, following the twentieth day of the month, unto the financial director of the city all such taxes levied and collected during the preceding calendar month. It shall be unlawful for any seller to collect the price of any sale of electricity, metered or bottled gas, (natural or manufactured), fuel oil or water service without, at the same time, collecting the tax hereby levied in respect to such sales, unless such seller shall elect to assume and pay such tax without collecting the same from the purchaser. Any seller failing to collect such tax at the time of collecting the price of any sale where the seller has not elected to assume and pay such tax shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax in like manner as if the same had actually been paid to the seller, and the mayor of the city shall cause to be brought all suit actions and to take all proceedings in the name of the city as may be necessary for the recovery of such tax; provided, however, that the seller shall not be liable for the payment of such tax upon uncollected charges. If any purchaser shall fail, neglect or refuse to pay to the seller the seller's charge and the tax hereby imposed and as hereby required on account of the sale for which such charge is made, or either, the seller shall have and is hereby vested with the right, power and authority to immediately discontinue further service to such purchaser until the tax and the seller's bill shall have been paid in full. 
(b)  Sellers remitting tax collections of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more, on average, per month over a period of three (3) consecutive months may thereafter, beginning in the month immediately following the third consecutive month, make all tax remittances to the city's primary bank by electronic transfer using the ACH system, or other electronic means as may be approved by the city finance director on a case by case basis. Those sellers meeting this criteria shall continue remittances by electronic transfer regardless of whether the seller's average collections fall below the ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) threshold for any subsequent consecutive three-month period. 
    All other sellers may remit by hand-delivery, postal service or electronic transfer. However, if a seller elects to remit by electronic transfer, that seller shall thereafter always remit by electronic transfer. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the event the total amount of tax anticipated to be collected within a calendar quarter does not exceed one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00), the seller of such service may, with the written authorization of the city, remit the taxes collected during such calendar quarter to the city quarterly. In such case, the tax shall be due on or before the twentieth day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which the taxes were collected. 
(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 12-34. - Exemptions. 
(a)  Purchases by the United States government, this state, and all counties, school districts, and municipalities of the state, and by public bodies exempted by law or court order, are exempt from the tax authorized by section 12-32. However, governmental bodies which sell or resell taxable service to non-exempt end users must collect and remit the tax levied under section 12-32. 
(b)  The following purchases of bottled gas and/or fuel oil are hereby excluded from the tax levied by section 12-32:

(3)  Fuel oil to be used as a raw material in a manufacturing process or to be used as a cleaning agent or solvent when certified by the purchaser that such fuel oil shall be used only as a raw material or cleaning agent or solvent. Such purchases and certification shall be reflected monthly on forms prescribed by the treasurer. 
(c)  Purchases by any recognized church in the city for use exclusively for church purposes are hereby exempt from the tax authorized by section 12-32. 
(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 12-35. - Computation. 
    In all cases where the seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas, (natural or manufactured), fuel oil or water service collects the price thereof in monthly periods, the tax hereby levied may be computed on the aggregate amount of sales during such period; provided, that the amount of tax to be collected shall be to the nearest whole cent to the amount computed, and shall not exceed the rates set forth in section 12-32 for any monthly period on each separate service. Such service shall be classified as a separate service in case of metered electricity, gas or water, whenever an individual meter is used for the measuring thereof. 
(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 12-36. - Records. 
(a)  Each and every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas, (natural or manufactured), fuel oil or water service shall keep at its principal place of business complete records showing all sales in the city of such commodities or service, which records shall show the price charged upon such sale, the amount of taxes charged upon each sale, the date of the sale, the date of payment thereof, the date such tax was remitted to the city, the period of time covered by such remittance and other related information that may be required to verify proper collection and remittance of said taxes. 
(b)  To assure proper administration of the provisions of this chapter, the city may, where possible and practical, conduct a periodic audit of such sales records of all businesses in connection with which the tax is imposed under this chapter. Failure to conduct such an audit will not eliminate the liability of the seller for collection and remittance of such tax. 
(c)  Pursuant to Florida Statutes, the city may, during the seller's normal business hours at the official location of the seller's books and records, audit the records of any seller of a service that is taxable by the city under Florida Statutes, for the purpose of ascertaining whether taxable services have been provided or the correctness of any return that has been filed or payment that has been made, if the city's power to assess tax or grant a refund is not barred by the applicable limitations period. Each such seller must provide to the city, upon sixty (60) days' written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this sixty-day period must be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the sixty-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than thirty (30) days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party. In an audit, the seller is liable only for its taxable accounts collected which correspond to the information provided to it by the city under Florida Statutes § 166.233(3). As used in this section, "applicable records" means records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due. Such applicable records may be provided to the city on an electronic medium if agreed to by the seller and the city. In accordance with Florida Statutes § 166.231(9)(c), any information received by the city or its agent in connection with such audit is confidential and exempt from the provisions of Florida Statutes § 119.07(1). 
(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006) 
Sec. 12-37. - Interest and penalties. 
    Any seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (manufactured or natural), fuel oil or water service failing to remit to the city on or before the twentieth day of each calendar month or quarter, as applicable, or if the twentieth day is either a legal holiday or is not a city business day, then on or before the first city business day, that is not also a legal holiday, following the twentieth day of the month or quarter, as applicable, all such taxes levied and collected during the preceding tax period shall be liable for interest on the unpaid amount of tax at the rate of one (1) percent per month from the date the tax was due until paid. In addition, penalties will be assessed at a rate of five (5) percent per month of the delinquent tax, not to exceed a total penalty of twenty-five (25) percent, except that in no event will the penalty for failure to file a return be less than fifteen dollars ($15.00). In the case of a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax, shall be liable for a specific penalty of one hundred (100) percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. The interest and penalties shall accrue from the due date until the date such taxes are paid, provided however, that the city finance director may settle or compromise any interest due pursuant to this section as is reasonable under the circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 717, 8-14-2006)

c.  The intent of the city to record the assessment as a lien against the property if not paid timely, within the period of twenty (20) days as set forth;

e.  The potential for the property to be subject to the sale of a tax certificate if the non-ad valorem assessment is not paid as part of the tax bill on the property; and

Individual properties within the city's boundaries, as they may exist from time to time, may be assessed for the costs incurred by the city in abating and remedying violations of this article.

(2)  The city undertakes or has undertaken action to abate and/or remedy the violation and, thereby, incurs or has incurred costs pursuant to the City Code; 
(3)  The property owner has refused, or otherwise fails, to pay the actual amounts due.

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 596, §§ 1-10, adopted Jan. 14, 1993, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Art. III, Div. 2, §§ 15-85-15-94, was at the discretion of the editor. 
Although it is not standard practice to include "whereas" clauses of an ordinance in the Code, it is the editor's opinion that the "whereas" clauses found in Ord. No. 596 contain material relevant to the subject matter of this division and also provide a comprehensive view of the intent and purpose of said ordinance. Therefore, the "whereas" clauses contained in Ord. No. 596 read as follows: 
   "WHEREAS, the City Council of the City of DeFuniak Springs, Florida, (the Council), is aware that local government may, by virtue of the twenty-first (21st) amendment to the United Statutes Constitution, regulate and prohibit various forms of actual and simulated nude and sexual conduct, and the depiction thereof, within and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages, See California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, Rehearing denies, 410 U.S. 948, 93 S.Ct. 1351 (1972); and New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714, 101 S.Ct. 2599 (1981); and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council is aware that local government may prohibit the exposure of certain body parts in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages, see Geaneas v. Willets, 911 F2d 579 (11th Cir. 1990); and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council wishes to regulate nudity and sexual conduct in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages; and, the Council is aware of evidence from other communities that indicates that nudity and sexual conduct, coupled with alcohol in public places, begets undesirable behavior, and that prostitution, attempted rape, rape, and assault have occurred and have the potential for occurring in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages where nude and sexual conduct is permitted; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council wishes to protect against similar conditions to the end that they not occur in DeFuniak Springs, Florida, at or around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council desires to prohibit the public display of nude conduct and sexual behavior or the simulation thereof in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that there are increasing incidents of nudity in public places other than establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages and in other places readily visible to the public; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that persons who choose to appear nude in public places are engaging in conduct which often serves to impose their nudity on others who did not seek it out, who are not able to reasonably avoid observing it, and who may be offended or distressed thereby; and, 
   WHEREAS, appearing nude in public places was a criminal offense at common law and was considered an act malum en se; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council desires to protect and preserve the unique character of DeFuniak Springs, Florida, as a family oriented, historic attraction for families, tourists and businesses; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that appearing nude in public places is still contrary to the general societal disapproval that the people of DeFuniak Springs, Florida, have of persons appearing nude among strangers in public places; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that the mere appearance of persons in the nude in public places generally increases incidents of prostitution, sexual assaults and batteries, attracts other criminal activity to the community, and encourages degradation of women and other activities which break down family structures; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that without regulation, public nudity constitutes harmful conduct and occurs in a manner which is incompatible with the normal primary activity of a particular place at a particular time; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council's sole intent in enacting this ordinance is to prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the adverse secondary effects such nudity generates, the Council nevertheless recognizes that there may be instances wherein appearing nude in a public place may be expressive conduct incidental to and a necessary part of the freedom of expression that is protected by United States or Florida constitutional provisions; and, 
   WHEREAS, a requirement that dancers don opaque coverings sufficient to cover the buttocks and the breasts as such portions of the human anatomy are defined in this ordinance does not deprive the dance of whatever erotic message, if any, it may convey, but simply makes such message, if any, slightly less graphic and imposes only an incidental limitation on the message; and, 
   WHEREAS, it is the intent of the Council to protect and preserve the public health, safety, welfare and morals of DeFuniak Springs, Florida, by restricting, to the full extent allowed by the United States and Florida constitutions, the act of being nude to places which are not frequented by the public and places which are not readily visible to the public; and, 
   WHEREAS, DeFuniak Springs, Florida, is essentially a rural-suburban community which has a population of less than 10,000 people; and, 
   WHEREAS, DeFuniak Springs, Florida, is a city that is, and desires very much to continue to be, a community that contains and is known for traditional wholesale public recreations activities and historic facilities such as the historic district of DeFuniak Springs and the Florida Chautauqua; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that the average person applying contemporary DeFuniak Springs community standards would find that the public nudity prohibited by this ordinance, if allowed, when taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value; and, 
   WHEREAS, non regulation of persons appearing nude in public places within DeFuniak Springs encourages commercial entities and other entities and persons to advertise outside of DeFuniak Springs and the State of Florida by billboard, radio, print and other media the availability of nudity in public places within DeFuniak Springs and thus encourages the influx into DeFuniak Springs of persons seeking to observe and/or participate in such nudity and to participate in the disorderly, harmful, and illegal conduct that is associated therewith, thereby increasing injuries and damages to the citizens of this city who will be victims of such increased disorderly, harmful, and unlawful conduct; and, 
   WHEREAS, competitive commercial advertising and/or exploitation of nudity encourages escalation of nude and lewd conduct within the competing commercial establishments exploiting such conduct and thereby increases the adverse effects upon public order and public health; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that the prohibitions contained herein are the most reasonable and minimal restrictions required so as to regulate conduct which is adverse to public order, health, morality, and decency within DeFuniak Springs when such conduct takes place at locations where the public is present or is likely to be present, or where such conduct would be readily visible to the public; and, 
   WHEREAS, the passage of this ordinance is necessary to preserve the basic character of the [City] of DeFuniak Springs, Florida; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council is aware that States may regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public places, see Michael Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 115 L. Ed 2d 504, 111 S.Ct. 2456 (1991); and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council is not hereby prohibiting nudity in truly private places or prohibiting nudity which is protected by United States or Florida constitutional provisions; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that the express exemption contained in Section 7(b)(ii) of this ordinance [section 15-91(2)(ii) of this Code] provides adequate protection to persons who, without such express exemption, might otherwise be prevented or discouraged by the ordinance from exercising constitutionally protected rights; and, 
   WHEREAS, although the Council is of the opinion that this ordinance is a general ordinance regulating conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by Florida Statute 125.66, the Council does not wish to become sidetracked in lengthy and expensive litigation concerning procedural matters that are not relevant to the subject matter of this ordinance and has determined to enact this ordinance under the more conservative, expensive, and time consuming "affecting use of land" procedure as well as under the general procedure for ordinances that regulate conduct; and, 
   WHEREAS, the Council finds and determines that this ordinance is consistent with its current comprehensive plan;"

Sec. 15-86. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this division to protect and preserve the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the citizens of DeFuniak Springs by prohibiting a person from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude, or causing another person to appear to be nude, in a public place and in other places which may reasonably be expected to be observed by the public within the incorporated areas of DeFuniak Springs except: 
(1)  When such person appears nude in a place provided or set apart for nudity, provided, (i) such person is nude for the sole purpose of performing the legal function(s) that is customarily intended to be performed within such place provided or set apart for nudity and (ii) such person is not nude for the purpose of obtaining money or other financial gain for such person or for another person or entity; or 
(2)  When the conduct of being nude can not legally be prohibited by this division (i) because it constitutes a part of a bona fide live communication, demonstration or performance by such person wherein such nudity is expressive conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a genuine message or public expression and is not a guise or pretense utilized to exploit nudity for profit or commercial gain (see for instance Board of County Commissioners v.

Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing permanent residence.

For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence to nearest outer property line of a school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate. 
(c)  Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; for a second or subsequent conviction of a violation of this section, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the county jail not more than twelve (12) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(d)  Exceptions. A person residing within two thousand (2,000) feet of any school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply: 
(1)  The person established the permanent residence and reported and registered the residence pursuant to F.S. §§ 775.21, 943.0435 or 944.607, prior to August 13, 2007.

Sec. 15-126. - Property owners prohibited from renting real property to certain sexual offenders and sexual predators; penalties. 
(a)  It is unlawful to let or rent any place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, with the knowledge that it will be used as a permanent residence by any person prohibited from establishing such permanent residence pursuant to section of this Code, if such place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, is located within two thousand (2,000) feet of any school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate. 
(b)  A property owner's failure to comply with provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this section, and shall subject the property owner to the code enforcement provisions and procedures as provided in chapter 30 of this Code, including the provisions of chapter 30 that allow the city to seek relief as otherwise provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 752, § 3, 8-13-2007)

ARTICLE III. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 18-17. - Site plan review. 
(a)  Expedited review and permitting. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to provide expedited review and permitting of development projects that substantially contribute to the economy of DeFuniak Springs through the creation of jobs. The expedited review and permitting process is intended to be an incentive available to developers of all major development projects. The review process for major development projects are included in this section, as well as appropriate references to other provisions within the land development code affecting major developments. The review team for the expedited permitting process will be composed of the planning director, public works director, building official, the city's consulting engineer, the fire prevention/life safety authority, and any other city department(s) as designated by the city manager. 
(2)  Expedited project review. The planning director or designee shall serve as the single point of contact (SPC) between the developer and the city. The SPC shall coordinate an expedited review process giving priority to the review of land use, zoning, site plan, and building permit applications. The city personnel reviewing a major development project shall give priority to development applications and shall report items that may result in a delay of approval to the SPC, including citations of specific code requirements in order to facilitate a timely resolution. The SPC shall contact the applicant within three (3) business days in an effort to review any item that may result in a delay to discuss the action necessary to facilitate application approval. 
(3)  The SPC shall assist the developer of a major development project and the review team in the processing of major development project applications according to the following timelines: 
a.  Prior to the submittal of a request for a land use or zoning change, site plan, construction drawings, or other application materials, the SPC shall coordinate a pre-application meeting. The developer and all appropriate members of the city review team shall attend. This meeting is intended to facilitate the developer becoming familiar with permitting requirements and city staff to become familiar with the project. The city staff shall provide guidance to the developer on how applications, plans, drawings, and other necessary information may be best presented to ensure a smooth and expeditious review. The developer shall not submit an application or other material for review, nor shall the review clock start running, prior to the pre-application meeting. 
b.  The completeness review of applications for major development project proposals shall be completed within three (3) business days of receipt. The completeness review shall verify that all plans, drawings, surveys, and technical requirements necessary for review are included with the application. A determination that an application is complete for purposes of review does not constitute a finding of sufficiency for any part of the application and/or its accompanying documents. The review team shall complete its review and provide comments to the SPC within seventeen (17) business days of the date the application was determined to be complete for purposes of review. 
c.  Major development project applications that require action by the planning board or the city council shall be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting that allows adequate time for legal advertising and notification requirements following the determination of completeness, unless the applicant requests a delay. 
d.  The building department shall complete its review of building permit applications for major development projects within fifteen (15) days of receipt, subject to any required revisions. Building construction plans may be submitted simultaneously with the application for development review, but in no situation shall a permit for construction be issued prior to any other required approvals. 
e.  Any proposed amendment, deviation, or change to a major development project plan that has received a development order pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the planning director to determine whether the proposed change constitutes a minor or major modification to the approved site plan. If it is determined that the proposed change is a major modification, it is the responsibility of the developer to provide supporting documentation for any proposed revision to an approved site plan. The roles of the SPC, developer, staff and the expedited process are the same that applied to the original application and shall apply to the review of the modification. 
(b)  Minor site plan review. The intent of this section is to allow the planning director to accept a plan (drawn by the owner, when appropriate), notify the appropriate department heads for input, and approve a minor site plan as defined below with a minimum of paperwork, time, and inconvenience to the owner. Plans will be stamped and filed with the appropriate project file. 
    This provision does not apply to any single family dwelling in any district where the use of the single family dwelling is used for single family residential purposes only. And, no change of use (i.e., residential to office, office to retail, etc.), will be considered under this provision. Requests for home-based occupations (HBO) are processed using the HBO process, but any associated improvements may be considered by the planning director and processed as a minor change. 
    Amendments to an approved site plan (or a development that may have existed prior to any requirement for an approved site plan) of the following types may be authorized by the city manager or designee, provided such amendments meet the city's land development code. 
(1)  Minor adjustments or shifts in the location and siting of buildings, structures, parking bays, parking spaces, landscaped areas; 
(2)  Changes in the location of utility tie-ins and dumpsters; 
(3)  Reductions in the overall density or intensity of structural lot coverage of the development;

    An applicant for minor site plan approval shall make application for approval on forms prescribed by the planning department. Any fee set by the city council by resolution shall be paid at the time of submitting an application.

(Ord. No. 881 , § Art. IV, 6-26-17) 

Sec. 18-18. - Concurrency management. 
    Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to describe the requirements and procedures necessary to implement the concurrency provisions of the City of DeFuniak Springs' Comprehensive Plan. Specifically, this article is intended to ensure the availability of public facilities and services and the adequacy of those facilities at adopted levels of service concurrent with impacts of development. This intent is implemented by means of a concurrency management system which shall measure the potential impact for a development upon the adopted minimum acceptable level of service for potable water, sewer, solid waste, drainage, parks and recreation, roadways and mass transit facilities and/or services as provided in the city of DeFuniak Springs' Comprehensive Plan. 
(1)  General regulations. 
a.  Certificate of concurrency required. A certificate of concurrency shall be required prior to the issuance of any development permit, with the exception of those listed in subsection (2) of this section. If a development will require more than one (1) development permit, the issuance of a certificate of concurrency shall occur prior to the issuance of the initial development permit. 
b.  Initial determination of concurrency. At the request of the applicant or at the discretion of the city, an initial determination of concurrency may be performed for preliminary development orders and a conditional certification of concurrency issued for development permits shall be binding. 
c.  Expiration of certificate of concurrency. A certificate of concurrency shall automatically expire simultaneously with the expiration of the development permit to which it applies. In the event that the development permit does not have a specific expiration date, the certificate of concurrency shall expire six (6) months from the date of the issuance of the development permit. In the event that a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of the development permit, the accompanying certificate of concurrency shall automatically be renewed for the duration of the extension given to the accompanying development permit. Should the extension exceed one (1) year from the date of the issuance of the original development permit, a new concurrency review shall be performed for which a reasonable fee shall be assessed in order to defray the cost of the new review. 
d.  Burden of proof. The burden of showing compliance with the adopted levels of service and meeting the concurrency evaluation shall be upon the applicant. The City of DeFuniak Springs will assist in the preparation of the necessary documentation and information. 
(2)  De Minimis exemptions. 
a.  Generally. If a proposed development relates to land use of such low intensity as to have a de minimis effect, if any, upon the level of service standards set forth in the City of DeFuniak Springs' Comprehensive Plan, the development shall be exempt from concurrency review. 
b.  De minimis activities. The following development activities shall be deemed deminimis: 
1.  Certain construction. The construction of: 
i.  Room additions to residences, pursuant to item (4)(c) below; 
ii.  Accessory structures, but not accessory apartments; 
iii.  Swimming pools; 
iv.  Fences; 
v.  Signs; and 
vi.  Communications towers. 
c.  Removal of trees. Removal of trees, except that tree removal shall not be considered a de minimis activity for the purpose of determining compliance with the stormwater drainage level of service. 
d.  Replacement of structures. The replacement of structures destroyed by fire, hurricanes, tornadoes or other acts of God not exceeding the area and cubic content of the structure prior to its destruction. 
e.  Limited de minimis exemptions for single-family dwelling units. Single-family dwelling units shall be deemed de minimis for the following facilities and/or services: 
1.  Roads, providing that the dwelling unit is not located within one-fourth mile of a road segment that is operating below the adopted level of service. 
2.  Stormwater drainage, provided that the single-family dwelling unit up to quadruplex (in this case only) is not part of a larger development. 
3.  Sewers. Sewer, provided that construction meets the requirements of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) related to wastewater systems. Specifically excluded from this exemption are room additions consisting of bedrooms or bathrooms. 
(3)  Concurrency review. 
a.  Generally. The City of DeFuniak Springs shall use the procedures listed below to determine compliance of an application for a development order with its concurrency management system. At the time of application for a development order, a concurrency evaluation shall be made to determine availability of the facilities or services required to be concurrent. An application for a development order shall provide the city with all information required so as to enable the concurrency evaluation to be made. Upon receipt of a complete concurrency review application, the City of DeFuniak Springs shall perform the concurrency evaluation for each of its public facilities and services. A concurrency review application shall not be deemed complete until all applicable permits, verification letters or other proof has been submitted pursuant to subsection (3)b. of this section. 
b.  Evaluation. 
1.  Roads. 
i.  Generally. The evaluation for roads shall compare the existing level of service standard to the adopted level of service standard established by the city's comprehensive plan for the impacted roads. The level of service shall be determined for conditions of the existing roads, to include any committed or funded improvements to those roads, meeting the minimum requirements for concurrency set forth in subsection (3)c. of this section. 
ii.  Submittals. The applicant for a development order shall submit to the city along with the application for a development order the following information: 
a)  The legal description of the development site; 
b)  The street address of the development site, if applicable; 
c)  A written statement indicating the nature and extent of the proposed development. 
d)  Any other information that may reasonably be required for the concurrency evaluation. 
iii.  City review. The city will then conduct a transportation concurrency review of the proposed project based on the trip-generated characteristics including the type of land development activity based on the ITE code, independent variables, trip rate, trip length and percentage of new trips. 
iv.  Traffic Impact Analysis. The applicant for a development order shall perform a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) as described below. 
a)  Pre-application meeting. An application meeting between the city and the applicant is required. The purpose of this meeting will be to review the methodology and procedure for calculation of trip generation rates, and to determine the study area and study period. This will usually be a PM peak hour analysis of adjacent street traffic; however, other time periods may require analysis or may be considered by the city where adjacent street traffic-based studies do not exist. The applicant shall use equations or rates from Trip Generation: An ITE Informational Report, latest edition. If the co-efficient of variation is (R2>=0.75), then equations shall be used; otherwise, rates shall be used. The transportation study shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a Florida registered engineer. 
b)  Define study area. The study area is defined as one-half (1/2) vehicle mile or three (3) percent of the maximum service volume of the impacted roadway(s) and is considered to be the primary impact area affected by traffic associated with the site. However, additional distance or a radius around the site may be established based on the average trip length associated with the proposed land use as approved by the city. The primary impact area will be approved by the city at the pre-application meeting. 
c).  Existing conditions. The following existing conditions shall be provided in the TIA: 
1.  Existing PM peak hour traffic volumes and level of service on all collectors and arterials within the study area as agreed during the methodology meeting. 
2.  Existing turning movement volumes at the impacted intersection(s) and intersection(s) level of service (LOS). Specify the LOS standard for intersections. It may be by approach, by movement, overall intersection, or v/c ratio < 1.0. 
d)  Sources of data. 
1.  The above required data shall be no older than the previous calendar year. Volumes shall be adjusted to reflect annual conditions using current FDOT seasonal adjustment factors for the city or other adjustment factors approved by the city. 
2.  Required level(s) of service for roadways shall be determined in accordance with the adopted level(s) of service of the roadway provided in the Transportation Element of the City of DeFuniak Springs Comprehensive Plan. 
3.  The publication "Trip Generation: An ITE Informational Report", latest edition, as published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers shall be used for independent variables and other information to prepare the report. 
e)  Projection of future roadway traffic. Roadway volume(s) shall be projected for each development phase including the year of the project completion. Volume(s) can be determined using one (1) of the following procedures: 
1.  Multiplying existing volumes by the annual growth factor provided by the city. Traffic generated by any major project approved since the traffic counts shall be included as background traffic. 
2.  Multiplying existing volumes by an annual growth factor developed by the applicant and approved by the city. Traffic generated by any major project approved since the traffic counts were conducted shall be included as background traffic. 
3.  Using projections from an area modeling effort. 
4.  Methodology regarding projection of intersection(s) turn movements and level of service shall be established at the pre-application meeting. 
f)  Projection of traffic generation. The following procedures and information shall be provided: 
1.  To determine traffic generation, the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Report shall be used or trip rates may be obtained from studies of comparable sites in the City of DeFuniak Springs or standards adopted by the city, and are subject to approval by the city. 
2.  Identify all land use codes, amount of development and trip rates. 
3.  Any proposed reduction factors for internal capture of trips between land uses of a mixed use project or for passerby trips shall be provided by the applicant at the pre-application/methodology meeting and approved by the city. Pass-by trips shall be less than ten (10) percent of the adjacent street peak hour traffic. 
g)  Projection of traffic distribution/assignment. Project traffic distribution shall be based on reasonable and acceptable industry assumptions and methodologies as applied to the individual site(s) conditions to be approved by the city in the pre-application meeting. 
h)  Transportation system management strategies. A discussion of any proposed transportation system management strategies shall be included in the study. 
i)  Provisions and measures. Provisions and measures which may be attached to the concurrency compliance certificate to mitigate or alleviate degradation of traffic level of service caused by impacts of the development may include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Project phasing. A project may be divided into logical phases of development area, with approval for certain phases of the development occurring concomitant with needed facilities being placed in service. 
2.  Out parcels. Those portions of the project characterized as outparcels that create separate and unique impacts shall be permitted when ingress and egress is provided only through the primary parcel and approved by the city. 
3.  Access management. Access to the site shall be designed to reduce or eliminate the impact of the development upon the abutting roadway facility. This may include parcel-to-parcel access drives. 
4.  Physical roadway improvements. The developer of a site may construct capacity improvements, acceleration /deceleration lanes, intersection improvements or frontage roads as approved by the city. 
5.  Operational improvements. The developer of a site may construct intersection improvements, including turning lanes, installation of or change in timing to signals as approved by the city. 
6.  Bicycle/pedestrian improvements. The developer of a site may construct bikeways or sidewalks connecting to existing or planned network facilities or provide access to a school, park, shopping center, etc. 
7.  Other measures. The developer may be required to implement other provisions for on- or off-site improvements that would reduce vehicular traffic impacts, based upon a plan originated by the developer and approved by the city and any other appropriate entities. 
2.  Potable water. 
i.  Submittals. The applicant for a development permit shall submit, along with the application for a development permit, proof that sufficient capacity exists as demonstrated by one (1) of the following: 
a)  If the service provider is other than an on-site potable water well, documentation will be required from the provider that the project is within its service area and that it has the capacity to serve the project as proposed, at or above the adopted level of service. If the ability of a provider to serve a proposed project is contingent upon planned facility expansion, details regarding such planned improvements shall also be submitted. Prior to the issuance of a development order by the city, the applicant may be required to provide evidence of a contract with the service provider, indicating the provider's commitment and ability to serve the proposed project; or 
b)  Permits issued by the NWFWMD for a potable water well to serve the development. 
c)  A notarized statement or affidavit that there is an existing functioning potable water well on the site. 
ii.  Presumption of available capacity. A presumption of available capacity shall be rendered by the City of DeFuniak Springs upon receipt of one (1) of the above. 
3.  Wastewater. 
i.  Submittals. The applicant for a development permit shall submit, along with the application for a development permit, proof that sufficient capacity exists as demonstrated by one (1) of the following: 
a)  If the proposed service provider is other than an on-site septic system, documentation will be required from the provider that the project is within its service area and that it has the capacity to serve the project as proposed, at or above the adopted level of service. If the ability of a provider to serve a proposed project is contingent upon planned facility expansion, details regarding such planned improvements shall also be submitted. Prior to the issuance of a final development order by the city, the applicant may be required to provide evidence of a contract with the service provider indicating the provider's commitment and ability to serve the proposed project; or 
b)  All applicable HRS permits for an on-site septic system, pursuant to Florida Administrative Code 10D-6, are obtained; or system have been paid. 
c)  Proof the city impact fees for the provision of a wastewater system have been paid.

a)  All applicable FDEP permits for stormwater management systems, pursuant to Florida Administrative Code 17-25, are obtained; and/or 
b)  All applicable FDOT permits for drainage connections, pursuant to Florida Administrative Code 14-86, are obtained; and/or 
c)  All applicable NWFWMD permits, pursuant to F.S. §§ 373.451-373.4595, (the Surface Water Improvement "SWIM" Act), are obtained. 
ii.  Presumption of available capacity. A presumption of available capacity shall be rendered by the city upon receipt of the applicable FDEP, FDOT and/or NWFWMD permits. 
5.  Solid waste. 
i.  City-wide presumption of available capacity. Based upon the data and analysis contained in the city's comprehensive plan, adequate capacity exists for estimated demand for solid waste services through the planning period (1990-1995). Therefore, a presumption of available capacity for all development shall be rendered by the city for the period beginning December 1, 1990, through the submission of the first concurrency management system annual report. At such time, the available capacity for solid waste shall be re-assessed, and a determination made as to whether the presumption of available capacity is to be continued. 
6.  Recreation and open space. 
i.  City-wide presumption of available capacity. Based upon the data and analysis contained in the city's comprehensive plan, adequate capacity exists for an estimated demand for park and open space facilities through the planning period (1990-1995). Therefore, a presumption of available capacity for all development shall be rendered by the city for the period beginning December 1, 1990, through the submission of the first concurrency management system annual report. At such time, the available capacity for park and open space shall be re-assessed, and a determination made as to whether the presumption of available capacity is to be continued. 
ii.  Minimum requirements for concurrency (determination of availability). In order to obtain a certificate of concurrency, one (1) of the following conditions must be satisfied for each of the public facilities and services, and such condition given in the certificate of concurrency: 
a)  For potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage. At a minimum, provisions in the city's comprehensive plan that ensure the following standards will be met to satisfy the concurrency requirement: 
1.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development order is issued; or 
2.  A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of development occur; or 
3.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a permit is issued; or 
4.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement that includes the provisions of subsection (ii)(a)(1) through (3) above. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, a development agreement issued pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services are in place when the impacts of development occur. 
b)  For parks and recreation. The concurrency requirement may be satisfied by complying with the standards in subsection (ii)(a)(1) through (4) above or by including in the city comprehensive plan provisions that ensure that the following standards will be met: 
1.  At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are subject to a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the development permit; or 
2.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires the commencement of the actual construction of the facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development permit. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380. 
c)  For roads. The concurrency requirement may be satisfied by complying with the standards of subsection (ii)(a) and (b) above. In addition, in areas in which the city has committed to provide the necessary public facilities and services in accordance with its five-year schedule of capital improvements, the city may satisfy the concurrency requirement for roads by basing this concurrency management system upon an adequate capital improvements program and schedule which, at a minimum, includes the following provisions: 
1.  A capital improvements element and a five-year schedule of capital improvements which, in addition to meeting all of the other statutory and rule requirements, must be financially feasible. The capital improvements element and schedule of capital improvements may recognize and include transportation projects included in the first three (3) years of the applicable adopted FDOT five-year work program. 
2.  A five-year schedule of capital improvements which must include both necessary facilities to maintain the adopted level of service standards to serve the new development proposed to be permitted and the necessary facilities required to eliminate those portions of existing deficiencies which are a priority to be eliminated during the five-year period under the City of DeFuniak Springs' Comprehensive Plan's schedule of capital improvements. 
3.  A realistic, financially feasible funding system based on currently available revenue sources which must be adequate to fund the public facilities required to serve the development authorized by the development order and development permit and which public facilities are included in the five-year schedule of capital improvements. 
4.  A five-year schedule of capital improvements which must include the estimated date of commencement of actual construction and the estimated date of project completion. 
5.  A five-year schedule of capital improvements which must demonstrate that the actual construction of the road must be scheduled to commence on or before the third year of the five-year schedule of capital improvements. 
6.  A provision that a plan amendment would be required to eliminate, defer or delay construction of any road which is needed to maintain the adopted level of service standard and which is listed in the five-year schedule of improvements. 
c.  Strategies to rectify lack of concurrency. Should a development not pass the above concurrency evaluation, several strategies may be used to rectify this, including the following: 
1.  A plan amendment which lowers the adopted level of service standards for the affected facilities. 
2.  An enforceable development agreement between the city and the developer which may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220. 
3.  A change in the funding source. 
4.  A reduction in the scale or impact of the proposed development. 
5.  Phasing of the proposed development. 
(4)  Adopted levels of service. The adopted Level of Service (LOS) standards for public facilities and services as contained in the City of DeFuniak Springs' Comprehensive Plan are hereby adopted by reference. 
(5)  Monitoring. 
a.  Annual report. The purpose of the annual report is to provide monitoring of public facilities and services to ensure maintenance of the adopted levels of service in a format which is accessible to the public.

Sec. 18-52. - Airport overlay district. 
(a)  Short title. This section shall be known as and may be cited as the "DeFuniak Springs Airport Overlay District and Height Zoning Ordinance." 
(b)  Findings. It is hereby found that an obstruction to navigable airspace has the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the DeFuniak Springs Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the DeFuniak Springs Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing, take off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the DeFuniak Springs Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared that: 
(1)  The creation, establishment or maintenance of an obstruction and the incompatible use of land in the airport vicinity are public nuisances and injure the community served by the DeFuniak Springs Airport; 
(2)  It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation, establishment or maintenance of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; 
(3)  The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation; 
(4)  The establishment of noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential of limiting the existing and future utility of the airport and may adversely affect the region served by the DeFuniak Springs Airport; 
(5)  Land in the vicinity of the airport has the potential of being exposed to sound levels of 65 DNL and higher. 
(6)  That the construction of certain noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport should include outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation features so as not to be incompatible with existing and future noise levels. 
(7)  Promoting land uses compatible with the existing and future operations of the airport serve to protect the public investment in the airport and promote a more livable community in the vicinity of the airport; and, 
(8)  The DeFuniak Springs Airport fulfills an essential community purpose. 
    It is further declared that the limitation of land uses incompatible with normal airport operations, the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein, or air rights thereover. 
(c)  Purpose and applicability. 
(1)  Purposes. The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the region by preventing the creation, establishment, or maintenance of hazards to aircraft; preventing the destruction or impairment of the utility of the DeFuniak Springs Airport and the public investments therein; and protecting the lives and properties of owners or occupants of lands in the vicinity of said airport as well as the users of said airport. 
The additional purpose of the regulations contained in this section is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city by requiring the incorporation of outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation measures for the construction of certain structures within the boundary of the airport noise district. 
(2)  Applicability. The regulations set forth herein are applicable to all lands lying within all approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical zones, which are delineated on the DeFuniak Springs Airport Height Zoning Map (Exhibit "A") and lying within the Airport Overlay District (Exhibit "B") adopted as part of the DeFuniak Springs Airport Zoning Ordinance. 
(d)  Airport zones. To carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surface, transitional surfaces, horizontal surface, and conical surface as they apply to the DeFuniak Springs Airport. Such zones are shown on the DeFuniak Springs Airport Height Zoning Map (Exhibit A) which is attached to this article and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitations. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Primary zone: The primary zone extends two-hundred (200) feet beyond each end of Runway 9/27. The width of the Runway 9/27 primary zone is five-hundred (500) feet. The width of the Runway 18/36 primary zone is two-hundred-fifty (250) feet and the primary zone ends at each end of the landing area. No structure or obstruction will be permitted within the primary zone that is not essential to air navigation or the movement of aircraft. 
(2)  Non-precision instrument approach zones: A non-precision instrument approach zones is established for each end of the runway. The inner edge of the non-precision approach zone coincides with the width of the primary zone and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet at the horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from the primary zone. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(3)  Transitional zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces adjoining the primary zone and the non-precision instrument approach zones. 
(4)  Horizontal zones: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary zone and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(5)  Conical zone: The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
(e)  Airport zone height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height exceeding the elevation of any corresponding approach, transitional, horizontal, or conical surface or to a height that would adversely affect approach minimums (e.g., decision heights or visibility minimums) published for the airport.

(2)  An application for a building permit for a structure to be constructed, reconstructed or enlarged within the airport noise district shall be accompanied by a plat or plan showing the location of the lot to be built upon, the location of the proposed structure, a certification from a registered architect or engineer, with acoustical experience that the plans for the structure include noise attenuation measures adequate to meet the requirements of this section; together with such information regarding proposed design and construction and such other information as the planning director or designee, may deem necessary to determine the conformity of the proposed structure with the requirements of this article. 
(j)  Permits and variances. 
(1)  Future uses: Except as specifically provided in (1) and (2) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient information to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved. 
a.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than fifty (50) feet of vertical height above the established airport elevation. 
b.  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than five thousand (5,000) feet from the inner edge of the approach slope surface, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than thirty-five (35) feet of vertical height above the established airport elevation. 
(2)  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or would permit a nonconforming structure or tree or nonconforming use to be made or become higher or to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
(3)  Nonconforming, abandoned or destroyed buildings or structures: Whenever the city manager or designee determines that a nonconforming tree, building, or structure has been abandoned, destroyed or damaged by any cause, physically deteriorated or decayed, and the cost of restoring the building or structure to a condition comparable to its condition immediately prior to the destruction or damage exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value prior to the destruction or damage, the building or structure shall not be restored unless the building or structure, as restored, will thereafter conform to all requirements of the height zoning district. No permit shall be granted that would allow such building or structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the height zoning regulations. 
(4)  Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in the article, may apply to the airport zoning board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a copy of the completed FAA Form 7460 (Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration) submitted to the FAA and the FAA's subsequent determination (Aeronautical Study) as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. No variance shall be approved solely on the basis that such proposed structure will not exceed federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 C.F.R. ss. 77.21, 77.23, 77.25, 77.28, or 77.29, or any other federal aviation regulation. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the airport zoning board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the City of DeFuniak Springs city manager's office for advice as to the effects of the variance on the safe and efficient operation of the airport. If the city manager does not respond to the application within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt, the airport zoning board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(5)  Obstruction marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, obstruction markings and lights. Such markings and lights would conform to applicable FAA standards. If deemed proper by the zoning board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City of DeFuniak Springs, at its expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(6)  Permit application requirements: An application for a permit shall be accompanied by a map clearly depicting the location and extent of the subject property in relation to the airport. In addition to the location map, the application shall include a detailed site plan depicting the property boundary; location of existing and proposed buildings, structures or trees; topographic and ground elevation information for the site; proposed finished floor or base elevations for buildings and structures; and, planned height of buildings, structures or trees (including antennae or other protruding appurtenances).

The airport advisory board shall not grant a variance to the terms of this article if the hardship is self-imposed by the applicant. 
b.  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this article upon which the airport zoning board of adjustment may be required to pass under these regulations.

(n)  Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the airport advisory board or the city manager or designee, or any governing body of a political subdivision which is of the opinion that a decision of the airport advisory board or the city manager or designee is an improper application of airport zoning regulations of concern to such governing body, may appeal to the Walton County Circuit Court.

ARTICLE VIII. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

Sec. 18-61. - Communication rights-of-way. 
(a)  Title. This article shall be known and may be cited as the City of DeFuniak Springs Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
(b)  Intent and purpose. It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. (2000 edition) § 337.401, as it may be amended, the city home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(c)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
(d)  Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(1)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(3)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city, which shall include the following information: 
a.  Name of the applicant; 
b.  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
c.  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
d.  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
e.  The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any. 
f.  For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(4)  Registration application fees. The city may, at its option, require a registration application fee through October 1, 2001. 
a.  Each applicant for a registration may be required to submit a registration application fee with the application, which shall not be refunded if the application is withdrawn; provided that the registrant may credit the registration application fee as provided in F.S. (2000) § 337.401(3). Fee amounts shall be established by resolution of the city and shall be in an amount not to exceed the city costs and expenses incurred in connection with reviewing and approving the registration. If the registration application fee is insufficient to cover all costs or expenses incurred by the city in connection with review and approval of the registration, the applicant shall reimburse the city for any such costs and expenses in excess of the registration application fee following receipt of written notice, which shall explain any additional costs or expenses. This subsection (4)a. shall be repealed and shall have no force or effect on or after October 1, 2001. 
b.  No registration application fees shall be imposed on or after October 1, 2001. 
(5)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the city manager or his designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (3) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (3) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the noneffectiveness of registration, and reasons for the noneffectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Noneffectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of noneffectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 18-61(h). 
(6)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(7)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(8)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (3), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (3)c., a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(9)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit may be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(e)  Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 18-61(d) within sixty (60) days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the city manager's office that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(f)  Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(1)  A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and may be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(3)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
a.  The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
b.  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
c.  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
d.  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other persons); 
e.  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
f.  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; and 
g.  Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application to review such permit application. 
(4)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(5)  All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the collocation of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. The city manager or his designee may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(6)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(7)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. (2000 edition) § 337.402, as it may be amended. For twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(8)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. (2000 edition) §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended. 
(9)  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(10)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(11)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in, Florida Statute (2000 edition) Chapter 556, as it may be amended. 
(12)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(13)  Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(14)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(15)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of city public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, and city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. No abandonment of any rights-of-way will be made without first complying with chapter 22, section 22-2 of the DeFuniak Springs Municipal Code. 
(16)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(17)  A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(18)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(19)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(20)  A wireless facility that is a portion of a communication facility, such as an antenna ("wireless facility(ies)"), which is attached to a legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way, such as a light pole or utility pole ("vertical structure(s)"), shall be subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Such wireless facilities may not extend more than twenty (20) feet above the highest point of the vertical structure;

Final, written decisions of the city manager or his designee suspending or denying a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the city manager within thirty (30) days of the date of the final, written decision to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall be waived.

Upon correction of the grounds that gave rise to a suspension or denial, the suspension or denial shall be lifted.

(4)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(5)  In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the city to cause the removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and is registered with the city, if required. 
(j)  Existing communications facilities in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city has sixty (60) days from the effective date of this article to comply with the terms of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof.

This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings. The city agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of city receiving notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost if in the city reasonable belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential conflict or appearance of a conflict. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted: (a) as denying to either party any remedy or defense available to such party under the laws of the state; or (b) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in F.S.

The design and installation of required landscaping shall be consistent with the following standards unless it can be demonstrated that the alternatives will meet the objectives of this chapter. The landscape development standards contained herein shall apply whenever a landscape plan is required. 
(Ord. No. 881 , § Art. XII, 6-26-17) 

Sec. 18-77. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as and may be referenced as "DeFuniak Springs Landscaping and Tree Protection Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.77, 6-26-17) 
Sec. 18-78. - Applicability. 
    The requirements and standards of this chapter shall apply to all new development, redevelopment and commercial expansions of fifty (50) percent or more to existing site area plan in the city.

(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.79, 6-26-17) 
Sec. 18-80. - Required landscaping. 
(a)  Vehicle use areas: 
(1)  A vehicle use area is any portion of a development site used for circulation, parking, and/or display of motorized vehicles, except junk or automobile salvage yards. 
(2)  The requirements for mixed use, commercial restricted, commercial general, and light industrial districts shall comply to the following requirements: 
a.  Landscaped areas must have a minimum width of three (3) feet and be landscaped primarily with shrubs and with grass, groundcover, and other landscape material in addition to required trees. The landscaped area immediately surrounding a tree shall have a minimum width of five (5) feet. The center of one (1) tree shall be no closer than fifteen (15) feet to the center of an adjacent tree except those trees grouped to achieve a 12-foot spread. 
b.  Where off-street parking and other vehicular use areas are located adjacent to sidewalks, streets, and other public rights-of-way, landscaping shall be provided between the public right-of-way and the off-street parking or other vehicular use area. Said landscaping shall include a landscaped yard at least five (5) feet in width containing an opaque screen of landscaping at least three (3) feet in height. Such screen shall not constitute any obstruction to visibility between two and one-half (21/2) feet and ten (10) feet in height if such obstruction constitutes as hazard to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic. One (1) tree shall be planted for each fifty (50) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of frontage on a public right-of-way. Landscaping is not required if the off-street parking or other vehicular use area is completely screened from the public right-of-way by an intervening building or structure. All curb cuts shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of street frontages, and individual cuts shall not exceed forty-five (45) feet in width. 
c.  Internal landscaping regulations. All off-street parking and other vehicular use areas used for vehicular parking spaces shall have internal landscaping to provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement and to channelize and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Interior landscaping shall account for a minimum of five (5) percent of parking spaces. Other vehicular use areas shall have one (1) square foot of interior landscaping for each fifty (50) square feet in all areas exceeding five thousand (5,000) square feet. Each separate landscaped area shall contain at least one tree, and a tree shall be planted for each one hundred (100) square feet, or fraction thereof, of encroachment by curbing, wheel stops or other barriers which shall be perforated to subdivide parking areas into parking bays with not more than forty (40) spaces, provided that no more than fifteen (15) spaces shall be in an uninterrupted row. If the site contains both parking spaces and other vehicular use areas, the two (2) areas may be separated to determine the interior landscaping requirement by multiplying the total number of parking spaces by three hundred eighty (380) and subtracting the resulting figure from the total square footage of the off-street parking and other vehicular use areas. 
Exception: Parking structures and covered drives in parking areas shall be excluded from the above internal landscaping regulations. 
d.  Intersection visibility. When an access way intersects a public right-of-way, landscaping shall be used to define the intersection; provided, however, that all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between two and one-half (21/2) feet and ten (10) feet. Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into cross visibility shall be allowed, provided they are so located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except grass and ground cover, shall not be located closer than three (3) feet from the edge of any access way. The triangular areas are: 
1.  The areas of property on both sides of an access way formed by the intersection of each side of the access way and the public right-of-way pavement line with two (2) sides of each triangle being ten (10) feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two (2) other sides. 
2.  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two (2) or more public streets with two (2) sides of the triangular area being measure twenty-five (25) feet in length along the abutting edges, measured from their point of intersection, and the third being a line connecting the ends of the other two (2) lines. 
(b)  Buffer zones. 
(1)  A buffer zone is a landscaped strip along parcel boundaries that serves as a buffer between incompatible uses and zoning districts, as an attractive boundary of the parcel or use, or as both a buffer and attractive boundary. This shall not be interpreted to mean that parcels within a planned mixed use development must meet these requirements. The following landscape buffer areas shall be required for all new development or redevelopment which creates the indicated land use conflict. 
a.  Natural plantings: Where natural plantings are used, a buffer strip in accordance with Table 1 shall be planted. This area shall be free of all encroachment by structure, parking areas or other impervious surfaces. The amount and type of buffer materials to be planted per one hundred (100) linear feet shall be as indicated herein. The use of plant materials other than trees and shrubs shall not be permitted unless approved by the city. 
b.  Where a commercial and/or industrial district abuts a residential district, a buffer shall be provided on the lot(s) which is located in the non-residential zone at the time such lot(s) is/are developed. This provision shall apply between residential uses where different mixed uses arise. 
c.  Where a residential use adjoins a non-residential use and both are located in a non-residential zone, minimal screening shall be required. A solid fence or wall shall be constructed as part of any new development or construction. 
d.  Where a single-family residential zone abuts a local or collector street and a non-residential use is adjacent to the right-of-way, screening shall be located on the property developed for non-residential purpose, to the extent that the non-residential use is generally screened from residential view. 
e.  The following tables should be used for every one hundred (100) feet of the buffer zone. 
Buffer level options:

(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.82, 6-26-17) 
Sec. 18-83. - Landscape plan procedure. 
    Whenever the provisions of this article are applicable in accordance with section 18-78, an approved landscape plan shall be required. 
(1)  Submission of landscape plan. A landscape plan shall be submitted to the city planning department. The landscape plan shall include sufficient information for the city to determine whether the proposed landscape improvements are in conformance with the landscape standards and other requirements of this article. 
(2)  Availability of copies. A copy of the approved plan shall be available on site during installation of all landscape improvements. 
a.  Design principles. All landscaped areas required by this article should conform to the following general design principles: 
1.  Landscaping should integrate the proposed development into existing site features through consideration of existing topography, hydrology, soils and vegetation. 
2.  The functional elements of the development plan, particularly the drainage systems and internal circulation systems for vehicles and pedestrians, should be integrated into the landscaping plan. 
3.  Landscaping should be used to minimize potential erosion through the use of ground covers or any other type of landscape material that aids in soil stabilization. 
4.  Existing native vegetation should be preserved and used to meet landscaping requirements. 
5.  Landscaping should enhance the visual environment through the use of materials that achieve variety with respect to seasonal changes, species of living material selected, textures, colors and size at maturity. 
6.  Landscaping design should consider the aesthetic and functional aspects of vegetation, both when initially installed and when the vegetation has reached maturity. Newly installed plants should be placed at intervals appropriate to the size of the plant at maturity, and the design should use short- and long-term elements to satisfy the general design principles of this section over time. 
7.  Landscaping should enhance public safety and minimize nuisances. 
8.  Landscaping should be used to provide windbreaks, channel wind and increase ventilation. 
9.  Landscaping should maximize the shading of streets and vehicle use areas. 
10.  The selection and placement of landscaping materials should consider the effect on existing or future solar access, of enhancing the use of solar radiation, and of conserving the maximum amount of energy. 
No development plan shall be denied solely on the basis of the design principles in this section. 
b.  Installation of plants. 
1.  All plants shall be healthy and free of diseases and pests, and shall be selected from the list of approved species below. The city manager may authorize the use of an appropriate species not shown on the lists and then shall add the appropriate species to the list. 
2.  Plants shall be installed during the period of the year most appropriate for planting the particular species. 
3.  Landscaping shall be protected from vehicular and pedestrian encroachment by means of raised planting surfaces, depressed walks, curbs, edges, and the like. 
4.  The landscaping shall not interfere, at or before maturity, with power, cable television, or telephone lines, sewer or water pipes, or any other existing or proposed overhead or underground utility service. 
5.  All plants shall be installed according to standards recommended by the Walton County Cooperative Extension Service. 
6.  The developer shall provide sufficient soil and water to sustain healthy growth of all plants. 
c.  Use of native plants. Forty (40) percent of the total number of individual plants used to satisfy the requirements of this article shall be selected from the following list of recommended native species. The remaining sixty (60) percent of the landscape material shall be composed of native or other species, except those species prohibited under subsection e. of this section.

(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.83, 6-26-17) 
Sec. 18-84. - Removal of trees and native vegetation. 
(a)  Protected trees. Protected trees shall include all species of recommended native trees listed under Landscape and Design Materials, section 18-83(2)d., and those species listed below. In addition to being included in the list of protected species, the trees must have a minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) which is measure at fifty-four (54) inches above ground level. The minimum diameter at breast height for canopy trees is eight (8) inches and the minimum diameter at breast height for understory trees is four (4) inches. However, with the long-leaf pine tree (pinus palustris) shall be protected with a minimum dbh of six (6) inches and be located within a ten-foot radius to be considered a protected tree. 
    Where a proposed site plan cannot be designed to accommodate existing protected trees on the site, approval shall be obtained from the city to remove any such protected tree as specified in section 18-83. 
(b)  Exemptions. In addition to the exemption for single-family homes set forth previously, the following uses shall be exempt from the tree protection requirements: 
(1)  Utility operations. Tree removals by duly constituted communication, water, sewer, electrical or other utility companies or federal, state, county or city agencies, or engineers or surveyors working under a contract with such utility companies or agencies shall be exempt, provided the removal is limited to those areas necessary for maintenance of existing lines or facilities or for construction of new lines or facilities in furtherance of providing utility service to its customers, and provided further that the activity is conducted so as to avoid any unnecessary removal and, in the case of aerial electrical utility lines, is not greater than that specified by the National Electrical Safety Codes as necessary to achieve safe electrical clearance. All pruning and trimming shall be done in accordance with National Arborist Association Standards. Written notice of the removal shall be provided to the city five (5) days prior to the removal, except that when the removal is needed to restore interrupted service under emergency conditions, no prior notice is required. 
(2)  Rights-of-way. The clearing of a path for existing or new roadway rights-of-way, provided that the rights-of-way are for existing roadways that are built in conformance with city standards or for new roadways that will be built in conformance with city standards.

The width of the path shall not exceed the right-of-way width standards for each type of roadway established by the city. 
(3)  Commercial growers. All commercial nurseries, botanical gardens, tree farms and grove operations shall be exempt from the provisions of this article, but only as to those trees and sites which were planted or managed for silvicultural or agricultural purposes or for the sale or intended sale in the ordinary course of business. 
(4)  Emergencies. During emergencies caused by hurricane or other natural disaster, the city manager may suspend these tree protection regulations. 
(c)  Conditions for tree removal permit. 
(1)  It is the intent of this section to minimize the removal of protected trees and that no permit shall be granted to remove a tree if the developer has failed to take reasonable measures to design and locate the proposed improvements so that the number of protected trees to be removed is minimized. In particular, the design must attempt to preserve specimen and historic trees. 
(2)  No permit for the removal of a protected tree shall be granted unless the developer demonstrates one (1) or more of the following conditions: 
a.  A permittable use of the site cannot reasonably be undertaken unless specific trees are removed or relocated. 
b.  The tree is located in such proximity to an existing or proposed structure that the safety, utility or structural integrity of the structure is materially impaired. 
c.  The tree materially interferes with the location, servicing or functioning of existing utility lines or services. 
d.  The tree creates a substantial hazard to motor, bicycle or pedestrian traffic by virtue of physical proximity to traffic or impairment of vision. 
e.  The tree is diseased, insect ridden, or weakened by age, abuse, storm or fire and is likely to cause injury or damage to people, buildings or other improvements. 
f.  Any law or regulation requires the removal.

1.  Application. Permits for the removal, relocation, alteration or replacement of trees covered herein shall be obtained by making application to the city in a prescribed form. 
i.  In the case of a subdivision development, the application for preliminary plat approval shall address tree removal and preservation. The city council shall have final authority over the approval or the denial of applications for permits in such instances. Staff evaluation of the appropriateness of the application will be included in their recommendation to the city council, and approval of the final plan shall constitute approval to issue the tree removal permit. 
ii.  In the case of any new development which requires review by the planning board or the city council or both, permits for the alteration, removal, relocation, or replacement of trees covered herein shall be obtained by clearly addressing the requirements at the time of site plan submittal. Staff evaluation of the appropriateness of the application will be included in their recommendation to the planning board, and approval to issue the tree removal permit. 
iii.  In all cases other than those described in subsections (a) and (b) above, permits for the alteration, removal, relocation, or replacement of trees covered herein shall be obtained by making application to the city manager or his/her designee. 
2.  Submittals. All applications shall be accompanied by such permit fee as shall, from time to time, be established by resolution of the city council. Each application for a permit to alter, remove, relocate, or replace trees covered herein shall be accompanied by a written statement indicating the reasons for the requested action and two (2) copies of a legible site plan drawn to the largest practicable scale indicating the following 
i.  Location of all existing or proposed structures, improvements, and site uses, properly dimensioned in reference to property lines, setback, and yard requirements in spatial relationship; 
ii.  Proposed changes, if any, in site elevations, grades and major contours; 
iii.  Location of existing proposed utility services; 
iv.  Location and identification of all trees (common or botanical name) which are a minimum of three (3) inches in diameter measured three (3) feet above the ground on the site within thirty (30) feet of the buildable area, designating the trees to be retained, altered, removed, relocated, or replaced. Smaller trees to be retained may also be shown by the applicant to assist the city manager or his/her designee in determining replacement requirements. Groups of trees in close proximity may be designated as "clumps," "forests," or "dense tree cover" with the estimated number and type of trees noted. Only those trees to be removed, altered, relocated, or replaced must be named (common or botanical name) on the site plan; 
v.  Tree information required above shall be summarized in legible form on the plan and shall include the reason for the proposed alteration, removal, relocation or replacement; 
vi.  Applications involving developed properties may be based on drawings showing only that portion of the site directly involved and adjacent structures and landscaping on natural growth incidental thereto; and 
vii.  For trees that are to be saved or retained, each application should contain a statement of how these tree areas are to be protected during construction and landscaping operations. 
3.  Application review. Upon receipt of proper application, the city manager or his/her designee shall review said application, which may include a field check of the site and referral of the application for recommendations to other appropriate administrative departments or agencies.

ARTICLE XIII. - NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION 

Sec. 18-87. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish those resources that must be protected from harmful effects of development. A developer should apply the provisions of this article before any other development design work is done. Application of the provisions of this article will divide a proposed development site into areas that may be developed and areas that must generally be left free of development activity. The proposed development should then be designed to fit within the area that may be developed. 
(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.87, 6-26-17) 
Sec. 18-88. - Scope.

ARTICLE XIV. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 18-97. - Administration. 
(a)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the 2012 Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development within the City of DeFuniak Springs that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the FBC; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the FBC are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code (FBC). This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the FBC. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the FBC. 
(e)  Findings of fact. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the FBC, as amended by the city, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with the ordinance. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the DeFuniak Springs City Council or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 881 , § 18.97, 6-26-17)

ARTICLE XVI. - SIGN ORDINANCE 

Sec. 18-106. - Purpose, intent and scope. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, general welfare and economic viability through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. While signs are primarily intended to promote a business, service or product, the sign regulations in this article are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints. The sign regulations are especially intended to reach the secondary effects that may adversely impact safety. The city is a small, primarily single family residential community with a strong commercial community to support the residents. Because the city is located along a major route from points north to the tourist destinations along the Gulf of Mexico, the economic base of the city is enhanced by tourism. This ordinance desires to preserve and promote the city as a desirable community in which to live and do business. These regulations are intended to: 
(1)  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; 
(2)  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
(3)  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(4)  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
(5)  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation. 
(6)  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use and function to which they pertain; 
(7)  Foster positive business culture. 
(8)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(9)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(10)  Allow for traffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of vehicles and pedestrians on streets and highways, and that notify the users of these regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream; 
(11)  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations.

(Ord. No. 756, Art. I, § 1.01, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-52. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared: 
(1)  Pursuant to Article VIII, section 1(g) of the Florida Constitution, F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041, the city council has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions, except when prohibited by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances. 
(2)  The council specifically finds that the city law enforcement system benefits all residents and businesses within the city and, therefore, the law enforcement impact fee shall be imposed on all law enforcement impact construction in all incorporated areas of the city. 
(3)  Development and redevelopment necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan and the impact fee study adopted in section 20-54 will require improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system to accommodate the new development generated by such growth and maintain the standards of service provided by the city. 
(4)  Future growth, as represented by impact construction, should contribute its fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system that are required to accommodate the impact generated by such growth. 
(5)  The required improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system needed to eliminate any deficiencies shall be financed by revenue sources of the city other than impact fees. 
(6)  Implementation of the impact fees to require impact construction within the city to contribute its fair share to the cost of required capital improvements is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management of the city. 
(7)  The council expressly finds that the improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system to be funded by the law enforcement impact fee provide a benefit to all impact construction within the city that is in excess of the actual impact fees. 
(8)  The purpose of this article is to regulate the development of land within the city by requiring payment of impact fees by impact construction and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the city law enforcement system which are required to accommodate such growth. This article shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand on the city law enforcement system generated by such applicable impact construction. 
(9)  The data set forth in the law enforcement impact fee study which were employed in the calculation of the impact fee rates imposed herein is the most recent and localized data available for the city law enforcement system. 
(10)  The administrative fees set forth herein constitute the city's actual costs for collection of the impact fee including the actual costs related to the administration and the collection process. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. I, § 1.02, 9-10-2007)

(4)  The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for," "designed for," "maintained for," or "occupied for." 
(5)  Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a regulation involves two (2) or more items, conditions, provisions, or events connected by the conjunction "and," "or" or "either...or" the conjunction shall be interpreted as follows: 
a.  And indicates that all the connected terms, conditions, provisions or events shall apply. 
b.  Or indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events may apply singly or in any combination. 
c.  Either/or indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply singly but not in combination. 
(6)  The word "includes" shall not limit a term to the specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other instances or circumstances of like kind or character. 
(7)  All time periods contained within this article shall be calculated on a calendar day basis, including Sundays and legal holidays, but excluding the date of the council's decision in the event of an appeal. In the event the due date falls on a Sunday or a legal holiday, the due date shall be extended to the next business day. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. I, § 1.03, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-54. - Impact fee study. 
    The council hereby incorporates the impact fee study by reference, particularly the assumptions, conclusions and findings in such study as to the allocation of anticipated costs of capital improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system among the various property uses and those assumptions, conclusions and findings in such study as to the determination of anticipated costs of additions required to accommodate growth.

Sec. 20-72. - Individual calculation of law enforcement impact fees. 
(a)  In the event a law enforcement impact construction involves a land use not contemplated under the law enforcement impact fee land use categories set forth in section 20-71 herein, the impact fee coordinator shall determine the impact to be generated by the proposed law enforcement impact construction and shall calculate the appropriate law enforcement impact fees utilizing the methodology contained in the law enforcement impact fee study. The impact fee coordinator shall utilize as a standard in this determination the impact assumed in the most similar law enforcement impact fee land use category or any other generally accepted standard source of planning and cost impact analysis. 
(b)  In the event a law enforcement impact construction involves more than one (1) law enforcement impact fee land use category, the impact fee coordinator shall calculate the law enforcement impact fees based upon the impact to be generated by each separate law enforcement impact fee land use category included in the proposed law enforcement impact construction. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. II, § 2.02, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-73. - Alternative law enforcement impact fee. 
(a)  In the event an applicant believes that the impact to the city law enforcement system caused by the law enforcement impact construction is less than the impact established in the law enforcement impact fee study and the fees provided in section 20-71 hereof, such applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such law enforcement impact construction or plat approval for new subdivisions, file an alternative law enforcement impact fee study with the impact fee coordinator. 
    The impact fee coordinator shall review the alternative calculations and make a determination within thirty (30) days of submittal as to whether such calculations comply with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  For purposes of any alternative law enforcement impact fee calculation, the law enforcement impact construction shall be presumed to have the maximum impact on the city law enforcement system. 
(c)  The alternative law enforcement impact fee calculation shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this article and the law enforcement impact fee study or independent sources, provided that the independent source is a local study supported by local data adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a generally accepted methodology of planning and local cost impact analysis which is consistent with the law enforcement impact fee study. 
(d)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant comply with the requirements of this section and that the calculation of the alternative law enforcement impact fee was by a generally accepted methodology that is consistent with the law enforcement impact fee study, then the alternative law enforcement impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fees adopted in section 20-71 hereof. 
(e)  If the impact fee coordinator determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to compute an alternative law enforcement impact fee do not comply with the requirements of this section, then the impact fee coordinator shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection and the reasons therefore. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. II, § 2.03, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-74. - Use of monies. 
(a)  The council hereby creates a separate trust account for the law enforcement impact fees, to be designated as the "law enforcement impact fee trust account," which shall be established and maintained separate and apart from all other accounts of the city. All law enforcement impact fees shall be deposited into such trust account immediately upon receipt.

A report will be prepared annually by the city reflecting the collection and expenditures of law enforcement impact fees by the city during the previous year. 
(d)  Any law enforcement impact fee funds on deposit which are not immediately necessary for expenditure may be held in an interest bearing account or invested by the city. All income derived from such interest on investments shall be deposited in the law enforcement impact fee trust account and used as provided herein. 
(e)  The city may retain up to one (1) percent of all law enforcement impact fees received or the actual costs of collection, whichever is less, as an administrative fee to defray all costs of collection relating to the law enforcement impact fees. 
(f)  The law enforcement impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be returned to the then current owner of the property on behalf of which such fee was paid, if such fees have not been expended or encumbered prior to the end of the fiscal year immediately following the sixth anniversary of the date upon which such fees were paid. Refunds shall be made only in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The then present owner shall petition the city for the refund within one hundred eighty (180) days following the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six (6) years from the date on which the fee was received. Failure to submit an application for refund within such period shall constitute a waiver of any right to a refund.

DIVISION 3. - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

Sec. 20-94. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from payment of the law enforcement impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations, expansion or replacement of an existing dwelling unit where no additional dwelling units are created. 
(2)  The construction of accessory uses or structures which will not create an additional impact on the city law enforcement system. 
(3)  The replacement of a building or dwelling unit where no additional dwelling units or square footage are created and where the existing and replacement buildings or dwelling units are located on the same lot. A certificate of occupancy must have been issued for such replacement building or dwelling unit within five (5) years of the date the previous building or dwelling unit was previously occupied, otherwise no exemption shall be granted. 
(4)  The issuance of a tie-down permit for a mobile home on which the applicable impact fee has previously been paid for the lot upon which the mobile home is to be situated. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. IV, § 4.01, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-95. - Changes of size and use. 
    A law enforcement impact fee shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory use or structure if the alteration, expansion or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory use or structure results in a land use determined to generate greater impact than the present use under the applicable impact fee rate schedules adopted in section 20-71, as applicable. The impact fee imposed shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  If the impact fee is calculated on a per dwelling unit basis and not on the basis of square footage, the impact fee imposed shall be the amount due under the applicable impact fee rate schedule for the impact fee land use category resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less the impact fee that would have been imposed under the applicable impact fee rate schedule for the impact fee land use category prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(2)  If the impact fee is calculated on the basis of square footage, in the event the square footage of a building is increased, the impact fee due for the increased square footage represented by the impact construction shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due according to the square footage resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement, less the impact fee that would have been imposed for the original square footage prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(3)  If the use of a building is changed after payment of the impact fee which results in a change in the applicable impact fee land use category of the building and such change is determined to generate a greater impact than the present use, the additional impact fee due for the change in use shall be calculated by determining the impact fee due according to the square footage of the building under the new impact fee land use category less the impact fee that was imposed for the square footage of the building under the original impact fee land use category. 
(4)  If an impact fee is imposed for an accessory building or structure because such accessory use or structure is determined to generate a greater impact than the present use, the fee shall be that applicable to the impact fee land use category for the primary building. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. IV, § 4.02, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-96. - Payment. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, at the time of the issuance of a building permit for an impact construction, or at the time of plat approval for new subdivisions, an applicant shall pay the law enforcement impact fee as adopted in section 20-71, as applicable, directly to the city. Payment of the impact fees shall be a condition precedent to issuance of a building permit for the impact construction. 
(b)  The payment of the impact fees shall be in addition to all other fees, charges or assessments due for the issuance of a building permit or for plat approval. 
(c)  The obligation for payment of the impact fees shall run with the land.

Provided however, the law enforcement impact fee rates set forth herein shall not be effective until the expiration of the publication and notice period set forth in section 20-102 hereof. 
(Ord. No. 756, Art. IV, § 4.04, 9-10-2007) 
Sec. 20-98. - Developer contribution credit. 
(a)  A credit may be granted against the law enforcement impact fee imposed pursuant to section 20-71, for the donation of land or equipment or for the construction of capital facilities for the city law enforcement system, as applicable, required pursuant to a development order of the city or voluntarily made in connection with an impact construction. Such land donation and construction and improvement shall be subject to approval by and acceptance of the council. No credit shall be given for the donation of land or equipment or construction unless such property is conveyed in fee simple to the city without remuneration. 
(b)  Prior to issuance of a building permit or plat approval for new subdivisions, the applicant shall submit a proposed plan for donations or contributions to the city law enforcement system to the impact fee coordinator. The proposed plan shall include: 
(1)  A designation of the impact construction for which the plan is being submitted; 
(2)  A legal description of any land proposed to be donated and a written appraisal prepared in conformity with subsection (e) of this section; 
(3)  A list of the contemplated contributions to the city law enforcement system and an estimate of the proposed construction costs certified by a professional architect or engineer; and 
(4)  A proposed time schedule for completion of the proposed plan. 
(c)  Upon receipt of the proposed plan, the impact fee coordinator shall schedule a hearing before the council at a regularly scheduled meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of conducting the hearing and shall provide the applicant and owner written notice of the time and place of the hearing. Such hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the proposed plan from the applicant. Such hearing shall be conducted in a manner designed to obtain all information and evidence relevant to the request. Formal rules of civil procedure and evidence shall not be applicable; however, the hearing shall be conducted in a fair and impartial manner providing an opportunity to be heard and to present information and evidence. 
(d)  At this hearing, the council shall determine: 
(1)  If such proposed plan is in conformity with contemplated improvements and additions to the city law enforcement system; 
(2)  If the proposed donation of land or equipment or proposed construction is consistent with the public interest; and 
(3)  If the proposed time schedule is consistent with the city's capital improvement program for the city law enforcement system. 
(e)  The amount of developer contribution credit shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  The value of donated land shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value as determined by an M.A.I. appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant, and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the appraisal does not conform to the requirements of this article and the applicable administrative regulations, the appraisal shall be corrected and resubmitted. In the event the impact fee coordinator accepts the methodology of the appraisal but disagrees with the appraised value, he may engage another M.A.I. appraiser at the city's expense and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two (2) appraisals. If either party does not accept the average of the two (2) appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of said third appraisal being shared equally by the city and the owner or applicant. The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two (2) appraisers and the third appraisal shall be binding on the parties. 
(2)  The actual cost of construction to the city law enforcement system shall be certified by a professional architect or engineer. However, in no event shall any credit be granted in excess of the actual cost of construction. 
(3)  The land donations and construction contributions shall only provide improvements or additions to the city law enforcement required to accommodate growth. 
(f)  The decision of the council as to whether to accept the proposed plan of conveyance or construction shall be in writing and issued within thirty (30) days of the hearing. A copy shall be provided to the applicant and owner. 
(g)  If a proposed plan is approved for credit by the council, the applicant or owner and the city shall enter into a credit agreement which shall provide for the parties obligations and responsibilities, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  The timing of actions to be taken by the applicant and the obligations and responsibilities of the applicant, including, but not limited to, the construction standards and requirements to be complied with; 
(2)  The obligations and responsibilities of the city including, but not limited to, inspection of the project; and 
(3)  The amount of the credit as determined in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(h)  A credit for the donation of land or a credit for the construction of an improvement or addition to the city law enforcement system shall be granted at such time as the credit agreement is approved and executed by both the council and the applicant or owner; provided, however, that the amount of an impact fee credit for construction of improvements shall not be deemed final until the actual costs of construction have been certified by an architect or engineer. In the event the applicant or owner fails to convey the property which is the subject of the donation to the city or such property is not ultimately accepted by the city in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement, then the credit for donation shall be revoked and all impact fees shall immediately become due and payable. The administration of said contribution credits shall be the responsibility of the impact fee coordinator. 
(i)  Any applicant or owner who submits a proposed plan pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a certificate of occupancy prior to approval of the proposed plan shall pay prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy the applicable impact fees pursuant to section 20-71 hereof. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, should the impact fee coordinator approve and accept the proposed plan, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner. 
(j)  Credits provided pursuant to this section 20-99 shall not be transferable from one (1) impact construction to another.

(1)  The application or calculation of the appropriate impact fees pursuant to this article. 
(2)  The rejection of an alternative impact fee calculation pursuant to section 20-72. 
(3)  Denial of an exemption pursuant to section 20-94. 
(4)  Any dispute concerning an application for credits pursuant to section 20-98. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, such hearing shall be requested by the applicant or owner within thirty (30) days of the written notice of the event sought to be reviewed. Failure to request a hearing within such period or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible shall constitute a waiver of the right to a review hearing, unless otherwise approved by the council. 
(d)  The request for hearing shall be filed with the impact fee coordinator and shall contain the following: 
(1)  The name and address of the applicant or owner; 
(2)  The legal description of the property in question;

Said payment shall be deemed paid "under protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any review rights. 
(h)  An applicant or owner may request a hearing under this section without paying the applicable impact fee, but no building permit or plat approval shall be issued until all impact fees are paid in the amount initially calculated or the amount approved upon completion of the review provided in this section.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 22-1. - Street naming and numbering. 
(a)  Street naming scheme: 
(1)  The following objectives shall be considered in proposing and assigning street/roadway names: (1) duplicate names will be prohibited, based on the definition of a duplicate name given in this section; and (2) simplistic approach to naming will be followed to ensure continuity with existing types of names. 
A master street list will be maintained by the city and provided to the Walton County Department of Public Safety, and all street names must be presented to the city council for review and approval prior to official acceptance of the proposed naming. 
Upon initial development of the master street list, all streets that do not meet the standards set forth in the "Addressing Ordinance," will be presented for name and/or address change according to the process outlined. 
(2)  All avenues lying west of U.S. Highway 331 South or U.S. Highway 331 North and crossed by one of said highways shall be designated as west avenues, and all avenues lying east of U.S. Highway 331 South or U.S. Highway 331 North and crossed by one of said highways shall be designated as east avenues. 
(3)  All streets lying north of U.S. Highway 90 and crossed by said highway shall be designated as north streets, and all streets lying south of U.S. Highway 90 and crossed by said highway shall be designated as south streets. 
(b)  Street suffix or thoroughfare designations. The use of thoroughfare designations as a locational device is a simple method providing a uniform designation of streets of different types in the same jurisdiction. Street suffix, or thoroughfare designation is not required, but if it is used it must conform to the definitions that follow: 
    Boulevard: A street divided by a landscaped center island. A street with a median reflecting the boulevard character implied in the name. 
    Court: Permanently closed street such as a cul-de-sac. A minor street less than 500 (five hundred) feet in length, ending in a turnaround. 
    Drive: Winding thoroughfares. Roads that meander about and continue through to other rights-of-way. 
    Highway: Designated state or federal highway. United States routes are designated as a highway. 
    Interstate: Roads of the highest order, characterized by limited access, wide right-of-way, prohibited adjacent to development, and with through-traffic preference. 
    Lane: Secondary roads connecting with each other. Reduced right-of-way branching from courts, places, or ways. 
    Loop and circle: Circles are short streets that return to themselves. Circular or semicircular roads. Loops would be short drives that begin and end in the same street. 
    Parkway: A special scenic route or park drive, generally designated by a name. 
    Path: A minor local street running in a diagonal direction. 
    Pike: State primary-numbered roads. 
    Place: A cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end road. May indicate the direction and to some extent the location of minor or dead-end streets lying between thoroughfares. 
    Road: Limited thoroughfares that are frequently used, have heavy traffic volume, and run in any direction. 
    Square: As used to designate a certain portion of land within the limits of a city or town, this term may be synonymous with "block," that is, the smallest subdivision which is bounded on all sides by principal streets, or it may denote a space (more or less rectangular) not built upon, and set apart for public passage. 
    Street and avenue: A basic principle is that streets and avenues run in different directions. Streets run north and south, and avenues run east and west, but this may be reversed as long as a uniform designation is followed within the same jurisdiction. 
    Trail: Any curvilinear street. A diagonal local street serving as a collector for one (1) or more local thoroughfares. 
    Way: Diagonal streets less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length. A minor street that changes direction or begins and ends on the same thoroughfare. 
The use of thoroughfare designations alone to facilitate locational access will be inadequate in all but the smallest of communities. But the use of designations within this standardized application will be beneficial. 
(c)  Use of abbreviations. For street suffix or thoroughfare designations, the United States Postal Service standard abbreviations will be followed. Refer to: Publication 29 USPS May 1990, "Postal Addressing Standards." 
(d)  Primary name limitations. Multiple names with the same primary are restricted within the city, as would constitute a duplicate street name as defined in subsection (f) of this section. 
(e)  Private roads. All private roads with multiple family/business structure must be named and specific addresses assigned to each structure. If the private road has only a single structure, and the entrance to the private road is from a named road, then the private road will be treated as a driveway, and an address assigned at the drive with the street name being that of the named road. If a private road with no structures leads to one or more private roads with multiple structures then the private road must be named. 
(f)  Duplicate street definition. Duplicate streets will not be allowed as defined in the following examples because a duplicate street name can cause confusion as to the correct location of an emergency and significantly delay response time. The United States Postal Service Postal Addressing Standards, Publication 28, (May 1990) will also be adhered to. A duplicate name can prohibit proper routing of calls. A duplicate street is a street that can be defined as a street that has the same name as another street and matches the description in one or more of the following cases: 
Case 1: Street name sounds alike, yet, is spelled differently and is in an area served by the same fire department (e.g.: Kathy Lane vs. Cathy Lane; Wild Wood Drive vs. Wildwood Drive). 
Case 2: Street name is plural (e.g.: Green Pasture Road vs. Green Pastures Road). 
Case 3: Street has the same primary name, yet it has #1, #2, #3, A, B, C, etc., as a suffix (e.g.: County Road 214 vs. County Road 214A). 
Case 4: Street is within the same postal delivery office and may span numerous zip codes and has the same primary name with a nondistinguishable suffix, or has a suffix omitted (e.g.: Lakeview Road vs. Lakeview Drive; Main vs. Main Street). 
Case 5: Street is within a different postal delivery office from the potential duplicate street, however, both streets are served by the same fire department. 
Case 6: Street is not contiguous, or does not connect and make a continuous street (e.g.: Smith Road is intersected by Interstate 10, however, there is no underpass or overpass connecting the two (2) segments of road). 
(g)  Street name changes. Proceedings should be initiated by either a petition of the directly affected property owners or a public official of the jurisdiction in which the street is located. The following reasons should be adopted for which a request for change will be considered: 
(1)  Technical. To establish continuity; eliminate duplication; correct misspelling; enhance east of location; improve coherence of street numbering system; or provide a needed roadway designation such as "circle" or "loop." 
(2)  Neighborhood enhancement recognition. To recognize a person or organization; to favor neighborhood association with its location, history, or area characteristics. 
(h)  Assigning street/structure numbers. General principals of numbering: 
Principle 1: The building numbers on parallel streets should be comparable. This implies that numbers on any one street should progress in the same direction as numbers on parallel streets. 
Principle 2: Property numbering should be uniform, based on street frontage. 
Principle 3: Numbering should be consecutive. 
Principle 4: Even numbers should always be on one side of the street and odd numbers on the other. 
Principle 5: The numbers system allows for expansion to accommodate future growth in the area. 
(i)  U.S. Postal considerations. The requirements and policies of the U.S. Postal Service will be considered in street naming and housing numbering. 
(j)  Numbering system. The method of assigning numbers is based on the measurement of mileage distance along the roads. The first step is to determine the point of origin for each road and consistently number in equal increments from the point of origin. This numbering is based on relatively small, equal intervals and provides the capability to assign numbers as needed regardless of the lot size of the existing properties. Unimproved, vacant property is not to be assigned a number until there is something constructed upon it. 
(k)  Even and odd assignment of address numbers. Even numbers are assigned to buildings on one side of the street and odd numbers to those on the opposite side of the street. If the project is extending addresses on an exiting road, follow the same numbering system on each side of the road. This should follow a pattern of even on the right and odd on the left side. As they increment up, even numbers should always be on the right, and odd numbers should always be on the left. 
(l)  Conflicting street numbers. Any old, or previously assigned number in conflict with the number given by the agency specified by the city council to maintain this system shall be removed and any person refusing or neglecting to remove the same shall be guilty of an offense. 
(m)  Responsibility for affixing street numbers: 
(1)  To ensure uniformity and regularity in the numbering of structures, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of any structure fronting on a named road to place numbers on the structure in so conspicuous a manner that the number may be easily discernible from the opposite side of the street. 
(2)  If any structure shall be located too far back from the street for a number on its front to be easily seen and read from the opposite side of the street, or the front of the structure is hidden, or the view obstructed by trees, plants, shrubbery, or other objects, then the number of such structure and premises shall be placed on a post, placed in a conspicuous part of the premises whereon the structure is located, and shall be discernible from the named road. 
(n)  Size and specification for street numbers: 
(1)  Each street number shall be of any durable material. 
(2)  All numbers painted on curbs or driveway approaches shall be black in color on a white rectangular background, or the reverse color scheme, and of a durable and waterproof finish. 
(3)  The numbers shall be a minimum of three (3) inches in height. 
(4)  Street numbers may be on the driveway approach or curb. If the lot has no front driveway, the numbers shall be centered on the lot. 
(o)  Other numbering guidelines. Multiunit structures shall use individually addressed primary numbers whenever possible. 
(p)  Signage. A street sign and a residence or structure marker will complete the link between assigned addresses and location of structures. All named roads shall have a sign. It is also recommended the following standards be met by all public and private road signs: 
Material: Engineer grade reflective sheeting on aluminum. 
Color: White letter on green background. 
Size and lettering: Use four-inch Series C (or B) uppercase letters on six-inch street name sign blanks (flat blade). 
Use two-inch Series C (or B) uppercase letters for Lane, Loop, Circle, etc. 
Use two-inch Series C (or B) numbers positioned in the bottom right corner of the sign to designate the block number of the street. 
Visibility: The sign should be free from any bushes, limbs, etc., which would inhibit the clear view of the sign from the street. 
Placement: Reflecting street signs shall be installed at all intersections and at other points where appropriate along the street. 
Signs shall be placed on approved metal posts eight (8) feet above the pavement in accordance with the Florida Department of Transportation standards and at the expense of the developer.

Sec. 22-8. - City addressing system. 
(a)  Short title. This section shall be further referred to as the DeFuniak Springs Addressing System. 
(b)  Designation of street names and numbers: 
(1)  Streets now being maintained by the city and other public agencies with DeFuniak Springs shall in the future be named and numbered in accordance with the addressing system. 
(2)  Future consideration of any proposed street name shall adhere to the (1) avoidance of duplicate or similar sounding names, or (2) those which indicate a direction, and (3) adoption of existing street names where an extension of any street occurs for continuity. 
(3)  Requirements and policies of the United States Postal Service will be considered in street naming. 
(4)  Changes of street names may be initiated by either a petition of the directly affected property owners or the city council. Name changes will be considered for historical or technical clarification purposes. 
(c)  Designation of structure numbers: 
(1)  Structure numbers for dwelling units, places of business, industrial locations and all other structures and uses requiring same shall be assigned and administered by the Walton County Department of Public Safety.

(d)  Posting designated structure numbers: 
(1)  The owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned, shall be notified in writing by the implementing agency of the number assigned to the same at any time after adoption of this section. 
(2)  Within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notification, the owner, occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall cause the same to be posted: 
(3)  [The assigned number shall be posted] either on the structure front, if visible from the street, or on an above-ground sign attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut. The numbers shall be no less than three (3) inches in height and of a color contrasting with the background. This section does not prohibit an individual from numbering front entrance of a structure. 
(4)  In the case that a building is served by two (2) or more driveways or curb cuts the number shall be assigned and posted to the front entrance or driveway. 
(5)  It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use, upon affixing the number assigned, to remove any different number which might be mistaken for or confused with the assigned number to the structure.

(e)  Types of numbers: 
(1)  Two (2) types of numbers are designated under this section: 
(2)  A primary number [is] to be assigned to each street frontage of each parcel of land, whether or not the parcel is occupied. The primary number is required to be posted only if the parcel is occupied by a dwelling unit, structure of active use and the owner, occupant or person in charge is notified under this section. Other primary numbers are reserved for future development of the numbered parcels and will be assigned at the time of development. 
(3)  Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures and uses coexist on the same parcel of land. 
Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium units, mobile (manufactured) home parks, office parks, planned unit developments, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers and other uses where the use of secondary numbers would clarify the location of an individual unit for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the addressing office shall work with the owner, principal occupant, or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines: 
(4)  Existing number units and uses shall retain the present set of addresses with only the primary number being changed if the primary number is not in sequence with the overall system. 
(5)  Building on a single parcel with more than one (1) and less than five (5) units may be given either a letter or number (preferred) designation as requested by the owner. 
(6)  A single building on a single parcel of land and with five (5) or more units shall be given numerical (preferred) designations, such as: Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc. 
(7)  Multiple buildings on the same parcel of land may be given secondary numbers consisting of number designations if the buildings are accessed from a main entrance to the project. The number designations will increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance.

Storage and accessory buildings for the use of the occupant of another building on the same property. Buildings used as dwelling units, offices or the nominal work station of an employee shall not be exempt. 
(g)  New structures and lots: 
(1)  Structure numbers will be assigned to each new lot, tract or building site on the original drawings of a final subdivision plat, mobile (manufactured) home park plan, planned unit development or any other plan requiring the approval of the city. 
(2)  No building, electrical, plumbing or mechanical permit for any new or remodeled or repaired structure will be issued by any department of the city following the implementation of this section with the city until the owner, developer or builder has procured from the Walton County Department of Public Safety the official structure number. Final approval for any certificate of occupancy or any principal building erected or repaired, or use requiring said number, shall be withheld until permanent and appropriate numbers have been displayed in accordance with the standards of this section. 
(h)  Implementation by city council. Every department and official under the jurisdiction of the city shall not render any nonemergency service until the owner, occupant or requesting individual has provided a valid structure number as necessary under this section.

Sec. 23-179. - Impact fee payment plans. 
    Notwithstanding any provision herein, the payment of impact fees specified within this section may be permitted to be made in installments upon approval of the city council. Such payments shall be made in three (3) equal payments, with the first payment being due upon issuance of a notice of zoning compliance/development order. 
    Payment plans shall only be available for projects defined as "commercial" and that are located within the enterprise zone. 
    An applicant seeking to utilize the payment plan specified herein shall make a written request using the form provided by the city at the time said applicant initially submits a project for review. 
    This section is voluntary and must be initiated by the applicant. An applicant who requests and is approved for an impact fee payment plan shall be deemed to waive any right to refund or reimbursement, in whole or in part, for any sums paid pursuant to the payment plan. 
    Failure to make payment as required by a payment plan implemented pursuant to this section shall result in the balance of all outstanding impact fees becoming due in full and payable immediately. An applicant who fails to make payment and is thereby required to make immediate payment in full may petition the city council for an extension of time to make payments based upon demonstrated hardship. The burden shall rest solely upon the applicant to request such an extension and to demonstrate a unique and specific circumstance that has resulted in hardship to the applicant. 
    This section shall be valid from the date of adoption through December 31, 2013, at which time this provision shall expire, unless extended by subsequent action of the city council.
