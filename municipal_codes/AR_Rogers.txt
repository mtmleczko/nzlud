PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rogers, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code or the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Peggy David, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(Code 1982, § 46-7; Code 1997, § 14-213) 
Sec. 8-208. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In the area lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter except as set forth in section 8-205(10). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city airport commission determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the planning authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny the application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(Code 1982, § 46-8; Code 1997, § 14-214) 
Sec. 8-209. - Enforcement. 
    It shall be the duty of the city airport commission to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed in this article. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the planning authority upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this article to be submitted to the planning authority shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the board of adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the airport commission.

Sec. 14-3. - Cave Springs area karst resource conservation regulations. 
(a)  Intent. These Cave Springs area karst resource conservation regulations ("CSK regulations") are enacted to protect the water quality of the Cave Springs recharge area and to protect the aquatic habitat of Cave Springs, including but not limited to the habitat for the Ozark cavefish. The CSK regulations apply within the boundaries of the direct recharge areas of the City of Rogers, City of Springdale, City of Lowell, and Town of Cave Springs, Arkansas. 
    The protection of Cave Springs' aquatic habitat water quality shall be accomplished by managing and/or regulating certain new development activities that may adversely affect the water quality of the Cave Springs recharge area and any threatened and/or endangered species in the Cave Springs direct recharge area. The Cave Springs direct recharge area is characterized by variable soil conditions and losing stream segments which allow localized and concentrated discrete recharge. Discrete recharge waters rapidly enter the groundwater system and pose a significant threat to groundwater contamination with low dissolved oxygen. 
    Critical elements of this regulation are to establish stormwater detention basins and buffer zones from losing stream channels and water ways and to establish best management practices (BMPs) for new development activities. These CSK regulations require a disturbance permit for certain development activities and prohibit certain development activities in designated areas. Where development activity is permitted, a disturbance permit shall require best management practices which shall depend upon the type of development activity and the location of the activity. These CSK regulations also require the on-going maintenance of vegetation and/or stormwater structures when required with a disturbance permit. The presumptive habitat of the Ozark cavefish shown on Exhibit 10-1 is not a part of these CSK regulations. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of these CSK regulations is to permit the development of property in a manner which will not degrade or adversely affect the water quality of the Cave Springs direct recharge area which includes the following specific purposes: 
(1)  Establish effective water quality regulations to protect the Cave Springs recharge area through the use of stream buffers, runoff reduction practices, filtration, source controls, construction practices and control measures, waste water policies and practices, requirements for buried facilities that are potential pollutant sources, and spill prevention and control practices to protect the quality of water that enters the groundwater system. 
(2)  Minimize the discharge of water into the Cave Springs recharge area with contaminants, low dissolved oxygen, or other constituents that may degrade the Cave Springs aquatic habitat water quality. 
(3)  Reduce the rate at which surface flows enter the shallow groundwater system that sustains the Ozark cavefish to promote natural cleansing and treatment. 
(4)  Establish procedures and criteria which allow flexibility in the application of best management practices and permitted land uses to prevent degradation of the Cave Springs recharge area which may result from new development. 
(5)  Require the submittal of relevant and accurate information for development activities in order to determine the applicability of these CSK regulations and review disturbance permits. 
(c)  (1)  As used in this section, best management practices (BMPs) means economically feasible conservation, construction management, site improvements, on-going maintenance and/or treatment practices that prevent, reduce or minimize degradation of water quality or prevent, reduce or minimize the increase of discrete recharge to the Cave Springs recharge area. "BMPs" may include a wide range of structural and nonstructural practices to be implemented in association with land disturbance, development and construction activities. 
(2)  The following vulnerability zones are established as shown on the Cave Springs direct recharge area vulnerability zone map, attached as Exhibit 10-2: 
"Zone 1 extremely high vulnerability" means the area shown in red, adjacent to losing streams, or all lands within the Cave Springs groundwater trough. 
"Zone 2 high vulnerability" means the area shown in orange outside the Cave Springs groundwater trough. 
"Zone 3 moderate vulnerability" means the area shown in yellow outside the Cave Springs groundwater trough. 
(3)  The following vulnerability zones are in the Cave Springs indirect recharge area: 
"Zone 4 low vulnerability with I-49 Corridor Highway BMPs" means the area shown in green on Exhibit 10-2 and includes additional area that extends further east. Zone 4 includes the entire indirect recharge area as depicted on Exhibit 10-2. 
(d)  Applicability. 
(1)  Effective date. The CSK regulations shall apply only to development activities that occur in the Cave Springs direct recharge area after July 29, 2015 within the Cave Springs direct recharge area. 
(2)  Applicability. The CSK regulations shall apply to the following development activities: 
a.  Any development, including but not limited to residential, commercial, industrial, construction of public infrastructure, or other grading activity, that exceeds one acre in disturbance or is part of a larger common development [any project that requires a permit for stormwater discharge from ADEQ - state stormwater - Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality]; 
b.  New or expanded industrial use, gas stations, laundromats, commercial development, mining, or hazardous material storage regardless of the size of the disturbance; and, 
c.  Subdivisions of tracts of land which create three or more lots or subdivisions which subdivide tracts of land greater than one acre. 
(3)  Exemptions. The following development activities shall be exempt from the application of these CSK regulations. 
a.  Pending applications that have received preliminary plat approval prior to the effective date of these CSK regulations, provided that such applications shall not be exempt if the final plat is denied or if the preliminary plat approval expires. 
b.  Development of single-family detached home on a residential lot which was subdivided and developed with public infrastructure prior to the effective date of these CSK regulations. 
c.  Residential or commercial development on a lot which existed prior to the effective date of these CSK regulations which does not cause the disturbance of one acre or more or which is not part of a larger common development. 
(4)  More restrictive regulation applies. In the interpretation and application of these CSK regulations the provisions herein shall be held to be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. Whenever the requirements of these CSK regulations are more or less restrictive than the requirement of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, including any applicable state or federal regulations, the more restrictive regulation or the regulation imposing the higher standards shall govern.

b.  At least one of the following criteria must be met: 
1.  The variance is needed to relieve hardship caused by the strict and literal interpretation of the disturbance permit review criteria which hardship is unique to the subject property due to unique characteristics, configuration, access, site conditions, or location of the subject property; or, 
2.  The relief from the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of a specified regulation, criteria or best management practice is necessary to achieve compatibility and uniformity of treatment among sites in the vicinity or to attain the objectives of these CSK regulations without the grant of special privilege to the subject property; or, 
3.  The relief from the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of a specified regulation, criteria or best management practice is minimized to the extent practical and the goals and objectives of these CSK regulations are otherwise met; or, 
4.  Soil studies are submitted that provide evidence the actual soils on the subject property are better than the soil types indicated in the vulnerability zone district designation and that the actual soil types allow for variance from the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of a specified regulation, criteria or best management practice while still meeting the goals and objectives of these CSK regulations. 
(4)  Required findings. The review authority shall make the following written findings before granting a variance: 
a.  That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties classified in the same vulnerability zone; 
b.  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity; 
c.  That the variance is warranted for one or more of the following reasons: 
1.  The strict, literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the development code; 
2.  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the site of the variance that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone; or 
3.  The strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the same zone district. 
d.  Conditions. A variance granted by the review authority may contain limitations as to time or disposition or use of the subject property in order to ensure that the stated purpose of the variance request is realized. 
e.  Expiration. The variance approval expires two years after approval if the disturbance permit is not commenced, provided that the review authority may approve a longer time period for the variance approval, including a permanent variance approval, as determined appropriate due to the circumstances and nature of the variance application.

Note 1: The structure of all pavement sections collector and greater shall be designed by a licensed engineer based on a geotechnical investigation. For minor streets, see section 14-45. 
Note 2: Normally the distance shall be 150 feet, however this distance may be varied in unusual terrain and topography. 
Note 3: In hilly terrain the approach speed may be reduced to 20 mph; the sight distance reduced to 70 feet. If the intersection is signalized, the approach speed will be the posted speed of the road. 
General Requirements: 
    Any street or roadway construction involving federal and/or state highway department funds shall meet the federal/state requirements. 
    Any sidewalk or crosswalk within public right-of-way shall be designed to meet PROWAG requirements. 
    Intersection right-of-way control shall follow MUTCD guidelines including but not limited to Chapter 2B Section 2B.01 through 2B.10. Four-way stop conditions should be avoided on low volume streets because there will be a tendency for the stop to be ignored and that has potential to train drivers that 4-way stops don't really mean "stop." Any proposal for four-way stops must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Community Development. 
    Any street stubbed out for future connection by others shall be labeled as such on the plan set. A MUTCD Type III barricade shall be erected at the end and a sign affixed to it which states "Future Road Extension". When adjacent property is developed, it shall connect to the stubbed out street. 
    Streets in a proposed subdivision must connect, where feasible, to existing streets in abutting platted subdivisions. Any subdivision which abuts a similar use per the Comprehensive Growth Plan shall stub out a minimum of one street to that adjacent property. Additional connections may be required by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee based on size of adjacent property. 
    Traffic calming methods are required in the design of subdivision streets. Tangent lengths shall not exceed 500 feet for Minor Streets. Studies indicate that operating speeds were 30 mph or less when the tangent sections were no longer than 500 feet. Long tangent sections can be segmented by conditions that require a complete stop, such as T intersection or by conditions that require reduced speeds such as a traffic calming device. Devices that are suggested for new subdivisions include roundabouts, traffic circles, chicanes, and curb extensions (bulbouts). Provisions shall be made to accommodate bike lanes if proposed. Curb extensions and chicanes shall be designed with minimum 20-foot internal radii and 10-foot external radii on all transitions to accommodate street sweepers.

Sec. 14-45. - Minimum pavement section by street and soil classification. 
(a)  For a minor street, the street shall have either a three-inch surface course and a six-inch Class 7 aggregate base or an eight-inch Portland cement unreinforced concrete surface course (with contraction joint spacing at a maximum of 15-feet) over four-inches of Class 7 aggregate base paving section. If the street is greater than a minor street, the engineer must submit a formal design, using PCA, The Asphalt Institute, AASHTO, or other higher formal pavement design procedures and be tested by a certified laboratory. 
(b)  For a minor street, the street will have six-inch Class 7 base and three-inch surface course. If the street is greater than a minor street, the engineer must submit a formal design only, using PCA, The Asphalt Institute, AASHTO or other higher formal pavement design procedures and be tested by a certified laboratory. 
(c)  Unless otherwise approved by the Street Superintendent or Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee, all PCC pavements shall have a minimum of two inches of Class 7 base unless the Street Superintendent or the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee specifies a thicker depth, but in no case shall the depth of the Class 7 base exceed four inches.

Site plans for all commercial development, residential subdivisions, and multifamily dwellings on collector, minor arterial, and major arterial streets will be analyzed by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee for critical traffic conditions for both the initial opening and full development of the site. AHTD deceleration lanes are required for single and combined uses that generate driveway volumes (trip ends) of 300 or more vehicles in the peak hour, as determined using standard Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates for the subject land use(s). Additional development requiring a building permit, which would generate driveway volumes (trip ends) of 300 or more vehicles in the peak hour, shall require the installation of an AHTD-approved deceleration lane. Four hundred feet minimum spacing between drives, measured centerline to centerline or from the right-of-way intersecting lines of public streets to the centerline of a curb cut, is required when deceleration lanes designed in accordance with AHTD are required. 
(2)  Joint and cross access. 
a.  Major traffic generators. Adjacent commercial or office properties classified as major traffic generators (i.e., shopping plazas, office parks), shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. Major traffic generators are defined as all restaurants and any other commercial development with a total area under roof of 5,000 square feet or greater. 
b.  Techniques. A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established wherever feasible in commercial zoning districts along streets designated on the City Master Street Plan, and the building site shall incorporate the following: 
1.  A continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each property served to provide for driveway separation consistent with the curb cut standards; 
2.  A design speed of ten mph and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles; 
3.  Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross access via a service drive; and 
4.  A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged wherever feasible. 
c.  Shared parking. Shared parking areas shall be permitted to reduce required parking if peak demand periods for proposed land uses do not occur at the same time periods (i.e., bank and movie theater). 
d.  Documentation. Pursuant to this section, property owners shall record the following: 
1.  Access easement. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint-use driveways and cross access or service drive. 
2.  Access agreement. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the thoroughfare will be dedicated to the City and preexisting driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway. 
3.  Maintenance agreement. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property owners. 
e.  Reduction in separation distance. The City Planning Commission may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical, provided all of the following requirements are met: 
1.  Joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section; 
2.  The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section; and 
3.  The property owner shall enter a written agreement with the City, recorded with the deed, that preexisting connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint-use driveway. 
(3)  Waivers. The City Planning Commission may modify or waive the requirements of this section where the characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation system impractical. 
(4)  Nonconforming access features. 
a.  Existing. Permitted access connections in place as of the date of the adoption of this section that do not conform with the standards herein shall be designated as nonconforming features and shall be brought into compliance with applicable standards when one of the following conditions occurs: 
1.  New access connection permits are requested; 
2.  Substantial enlargements or improvements are made; 
3.  As roadway improvements allow; or 
4.  Significant change in trip generation. 
b.  Discontinued use. If the principal activity on a property with nonconforming access features is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days then that property must thereafter be brought into conformity with all applicable connection spacing and design requirements, unless otherwise exempted by the City Planning Commission. For uses that are vacant or discontinued upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, the 180-day period begins on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived.

DIVISION 4. - OVERLAY DISTRICT STANDARDS 

Sec. 14-284. - Established. 
(a)  An overlay district is hereby established within the City consistent with the objectives of the land use plan adopted by the City. The purpose of the overlay district is to protect and enhance the scenic quality of the City's highways and primary corridors designated below, create design standards for developments, and provide effective land use planning and facilitate traffic flow. 
(b)  The overlay district shall extend along West Walnut Street from Interstate I-49 east to South 8th Street (U.S. 71B); along South 8th Street from West Walnut Street to the south City limits; along Highway 62 from the east City limits to the west City limits; along State Highway 12 from 2nd Street to the east City limits; along New Hope Road from Dixieland Road to Interstate I-540; and along New Hope Road from South 8th Street to a point 1500 feet west and along Interstate I-540 from the north City limits to the south City limits; Pleasant Grove Road from South 8th Street (U.S. 71B) to Bellview. The district encompasses all lands with highway or primary corridor frontage, lying within 330 feet of the right-of-way on both sides of the designated highways and corridors within the City limits. 
(Code 1997, § 60-60; Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, 1-14-2014; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-285. - Design standards, regulations and required improvements for developments within overlay districts. 
    The regulations of the overlay district shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts and ordinance requirements regulating the development of land so that any parcel of land lying in the overlay district shall also lie within one or more of the other underlying zoning districts. Design standards within the overlay district shall be as follows: 
(1)  Lot size for any development shall be a minimum of one acre. 
(2)  Front yards for all principal and accessory buildings or structures shall be no less than 75 feet from the property line abutting the highways and primary corridors designated in section 14-284(b). All other setbacks for the underlying zone shall apply. 
(3)  Required landscape areas along the frontage of the highways and primary corridors designated in section 14-284(b) shall be no less than 25 feet deep exclusive of the right-of-way. Within this area the developer will plant trees at 20-foot spacing for the full width of the frontage. All plant materials on the site must meet the requirements of division 3 of this article. Trees provided as part of the overlay district requirement apply toward the minimum plant requirement of division 3 of this article. Developer should attempt to incorporate existing on-site trees into the landscaping plan and indicate on plan. If a developer demonstrates that this requirement will constitute an undue hardship, or where the requirements conflict with existing public utilities, the Planning Commission may vary from the ordinance. 
(4)  Required landscape areas along the rear and side yards shall be no less than ten feet deep from the property line and locations are to be coordinated with the Department of Community Development. Where rear or side yards abut a street right-of-way, a 15-foot deep landscaped area shall be required when adjacent land is zoned office, residential or commercial. 
(5)  Erosion retardant vegetation shall be used on all cuts and fills. 
(6)  Tree species to be planted within these corridors should be consistent with the recommended plants list. 
(7)  Buildings within a commercial development with three or more tenants shall be allowed one sign, no more than ten feet in height and with no more than 100 square feet in face area. 
(8)  A commercial development with two or less tenants shall be allowed a single monument-type, ground-mounted sign located on the building site or in the landscaped front yard. The sign shall be a maximum of six feet in height and 72 square feet in sign face area. 
(9)  When a development involves multiple building sites, whether on one or more platted lots, the above-described regulations regarding yard setbacks, landscaping, and signage shall apply to the development as an entire tract rather than to each platted lot. 
(10)  Property which cannot be developed without violating the standards of this article may be allowed variances by the Planning Commission during the large-scale development plan consideration process as long as the variance requests are consistent with the purpose and intent of the overlay standards. 
(Code 1997, § 60-60; Ord. No. 04-56, § 7(4.01), 5-25-2004; Ord. No. 07-134, § 1, 10-9-2007; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016)

c.  In addition to the procedure described in subsection (9)b. of this section, all cuts and excavations made in streets paved with hot mix shall be repaired by the applicant. In every instance, the applicant responsible for making repairs to newly cut streets shall pay all costs encountered for repair and/or relocation of all existing utilities.

d.  The City Engineer may require any limited movement collector or local street intersections to include an access control median or other acceptable access control device. 
(5)  Where necessary for public convenience or safety, a developer shall improve and dedicate to the public a pedestrian and bicycle access way to connect to cul-de-sac streets, to pass through odd-shaped or oversized city blocks 660 feet or longer, to complete existing pedestrian and bicycle routes, and to provide for networks of public paths creating access to schools, parks, shopping centers, transit stops, churches, or other destinations. Pedestrian and bicycle access shall be made in accordance with City sidewalk, sidepath, and trails standards as determined by the City Engineer based on context, i.e., sidewalks shall connect to sidewalks, sidepaths to sidepaths, trails to trails. 
a.  The developer shall provide all required elements to include recreational easements and/or right-of-way dedication. 
b.  Pedestrian and bicycle access ways established under this requirement shall count toward setback requirements for structures placed on adjacent property, for example, if a 10-foot public right-of-way is established between two residential parcels, each parcel may count 5 feet of the right-of-way toward structural setback requirements. 
c.  Pedestrian and bicycle access ways shall be constructed at the time of initial construction of a development. 
(6)  The requirements of paragraphs 14-604 (c)(2) above may be waived if, in the written opinion of the City Engineer, they are infeasible due to unusual topographic features, existing development, a natural area or feature, in the case of large format retail on a single parcel, or other warranted reason.

d.  All corner radii must be shown on the street improvement plan. 
e.  The lesser street classification shall be used to determine the curb radius at the intersection. 
(8)  Street grades. Street grades shall conform to the following: 
a.  Street grades for arterial highways and collector streets shall not exceed eight percent; grades for all other classifications of streets shall not exceed ten percent. 
b.  All changes in grade exceeding 1% shall be connected by a vertical curve meeting the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (most current edition) for the design speed. 
c.  In approaching intersections, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street grade, generally not exceeding five percent, for a distance of not less than 50 feet from the nearest line of the intersecting street, or a percentage and distance approved by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee. 
d.  To the extent possible and practical, all minor streets and driveways should be sloped away from the major street or county road to prevent water and debris from being deposited on the major street or road. 
e.  The grade within the intersection should be as level as possible, and consistent with proper provisions for drainage. 
(9)  Abutting federal, state or other arterial trafficway. In platting lands abutting federal and state highway or other arterial trafficways, every effort shall be made to: 
a.  Cushion the adverse impact of heavy or high speed traffic on such lands, especially where used for residential purposes; and

Pavement structural design based on equivalent axle loads (EALs) for each street shall be classified by function and/or traffic in one of the following classes: 
(1)  Minor-Residential subdivision and light commercial streets. These streets have an average of 50 to 150 vehicles per day and not more than ten average 18 kip EALs per day, or not more than 73,000 total 18 kip EALs during the 20 year design period. 
(2)  Collector-Residential collector and commercial streets. These streets have an average of 150 to 400 vehicles per day and not more than 40 average 18 kip EALs during the 20 year design period. 
(3)  Minor arterial-Residential arterial, heavy, commercial, and light industrial streets. These streets include: 
a.  Arterials in residential subdivisions, heavy commercial streets; and light industrial streets; 
b.  They have an average of 400 to 850 vehicles per day and not more than 80 average 18 kip EALs per day, or not more than 584,000 total 18 kip EALs during the 20 year design period. 
(4)  Major arterials and boulevards-All higher class streets and highways. 
a.  Average daily traffic (ADT) may be estimated at the rate of five to six round trips per resident or dwelling unit per day. 
b.  For collector and minor arterials, the EALs are based on 100 percent of the one-way ADT times a load factor of 0.09 for single unit trucks, plus ten percent of the one-way ADT times a load factor of 1.00 for multiple unit trucks. 
(b)  Pavement section. For a minor street, the street will have six-inch Class 7 base and three-inch surface course. If the street is greater than a minor street, the engineer must submit a formal design only, using PCA, The Asphalt Institute, AASHTO or other higher formal pavement design procedures and be tested by a certified laboratory.

The required width of right-of-way dedication shall be determined during the preliminary plat review and approval stage. When the proposed development is of a size and magnitude to show cause for additional street development, such access street shall have standard right-of-way easements and road construction that comply with appropriate City standards. 
(2)  If an off-site substandard street serves a proposed development the developer shall be responsible for the entire cost of improving the off-site section of street to the current City standards. The upgrading of said off-site section of street shall be included as a part of the development plan. 
(3)  The street improvement cost shall include, but not be limited to, the costs of right-of-way clearing, roadway excavation and embankment, bridges, pipe and box culverts, roadway shaping, drainage blankets, base paving, utility adjustments, and miscellaneous items. The developer's proportionate share of the street improvement costs shall be 50 percent when the development abuts one side of the street, and 100 percent when the development abuts both sides of the street. 
(4)  The type of street improvement shall be based on the City master street plan and design standards. The developer's proportionate share of the cost of improving the street shall be determined by the Department of Community Development. 
(5)  Depending on the road classification, surface type, surface width and condition, traffic, terrain, alignment, drainage, and budget one of the following types of improvements shall be made: 
a.  Patching and hot mix overlay within existing right-of-way with some possible drainage and alignment work. 
b.  Reconstruction involving right-of-way clearing, drainage structures, shaping roadway, drainage blankets, base paving and miscellaneous items. The paving shall consist of asphalt hot mix surface course. 
(6)  The required off-site improvements and the developer's proportionate share of the cost shall be determined at the preliminary plat review and approval stage.

Sec. 14-710. - C-3 neighborhood commercial district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This district is intended for areas designated as Neighborhood Centers on the city's Comprehensive Growth Map. The ideal application of this district is the development of a compact, mixed-use, neighborhood-oriented environment that transitions into lower density residential near Neighborhood Center boundaries. This district allows uses that provide essential goods and services to surrounding neighborhoods in a way that promotes placemaking and pedestrian accessibility. It is also intended to encourage medium-density residential development such as townhomes, bungalow courts, and other multi-unit or attached single-family housing types. Because the permitted non-residential uses are intended to be integral to the functions of a neighborhood, emphasis is placed on design and neighborhood compatibility.

Sec. 14-715. - Downtown Rogers Development Code (DRDC).[6] 
1.0 Purpose and Intent 
The purpose of the Downtown Rogers Development Code (DRDC) is to guide redevelopment in the Downtown Rogers area by building on the success of the historic core to implement the vision for a more walkable, vibrant, mixed use neighborhood by: 
a)  Preserving and enhancing the existing development character of downtown and adjoining neighborhoods through a comprehensive form-based approach to achieve mixed use, transitions, and pedestrian-oriented design. 
b)  Creating appropriate Zones to implement the vision for different areas of downtown - Core Mixed Use, Commercial Mixed Use, Industrial Arts and Neighborhood Transition, which implements the Downtown Rogers Initiative Plan, adopted July 2015. 
c)  Establishing appropriate urban design standards associated with each Zone including building form, use, and public open space standards with a focus on implementing pedestrian-oriented design. 
d)  Establishing a clear review, approval, and appeals process for all development. 
1.1 Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan 
Within any area subject to the approved area of the DRDC zone, City Code Section 14-715 becomes the mandatory regulations, unless specified in Subsection 2.2 (Relationship to other City ordinances). It shall establish the following development standards for all properties within the DRDC area: 
a)  Establishment of DRDC Zones: The DRDC area is distinguished into different zones. Each zone is intended to respond to distinct urban aspects within Downtown Rogers and is based on the illustrative vision for the different zones within the DRDC area. Each zone shall establish use and building form standards including standards for building height, mass, placement, functional design and parking. The Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan classifies all lots within the DRDC area into one of the following four zones: 
i.  Core Mixed Use (COR) - The purpose of the Core Mixed Use Zone is to highlight the historic core of Downtown Rogers and expand the core to include key locations for mixed-use development, compatible with the downtown core. The intent is to mix commercial uses with some residential and public uses. Focusing on pedestrian facilities and unique experience destinations will be a key to establishing Downtown Rogers as a place for public interaction. 
ii.  Commercial Mixed Use (COM) - The purpose of the Commercial Mixed Use Zone is to be compatible with the Core Mixed Use through flexibility of uses, continuing to allow retail, education and commercial as primary uses, but also including residential as a core use to be located within Downtown Rogers. The focus is to transition this area as a more livable location, by upgrading infrastructure for development while also making this area friendlier to residential uses. 
iii.  Industrial Arts (IA) - The purpose of the Industrial Arts Zone is to focus this area on the goal to establish local artisanal manufacturing, light industrial and businesses close by downtown. These developments will take advantage of being accessible to rail, trails and Arkansas Street. The intent is to mix manufacturing, residential, and retail in a walkable yet flexible format. 
iv.  Neighborhood Transition (NBT) - The purpose of the Neighborhood Transition Zone is to support appropriate transition between existing residential neighborhoods and open space and the more active commercial and urban residential areas. The intent is to support the character of the neighborhoods around downtown. Additional transition requirements will also be included in the regulations for the other three Zones. 
b)  Street Designations: The streets within the DRDC area shall be classified by their street type in coordination with the Master Street Plan and the context of the surrounding development. Street cross sections shall address vehicular lane widths, number of lanes, pedestrian accommodation, street tree requirements, on-street parking, and parkway and median standards. These standards are laid out in Subsection 6 (Street Design Standards). The streets sections complement the Complete Streets Plan for the City of Rogers. Construction and composition requirements for streets are located in Chapter 14, Article II Design Criteria and Construction Specifications for Division, Development and Improvement of Land, Division 3 Streets and Roadways. 
c)  Building Frontage Standards: Building Frontage designations shall classify different block frontages based on the pedestrian priority goals of the vision and are labeled on the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan (Attachment 1). Building frontages are categorized into one of the three types: 
i.  Pedestrian Priority Frontage has the highest quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Focus is on wider sidewalks, ample clear space, appropriate street furniture, adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area. Buildings will be required to address the pedestrian area and provide a higher quality of commercial design standards. 
ii.  Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage has a middle quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Focus is on adequate sidewalks, ample clear space, appropriate street furniture, adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area. Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages lead to Pedestrian Priority Frontages and expand connections to these areas into adjacent neighborhoods. 
iii.  General Frontage has a basic quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Any frontage not labeled as a Pedestrian Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly is considered a General Frontage. Focus is on required pedestrian access, adequate clear space, select locations for street furniture, adequate lighting and safe vehicular-pedestrian interactions within the streetscape area. 
d)  Public Open Space Designation: Public Open Space within the DRDC is denoted on the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan (Attachment 1). Detailed standards for any additional Public Open Space or improvements to existing Public Open Space are included in Subsection 7 (Open Space Standards). These standards include general character, typical size, frontage requirements and typical uses within these public open spaces. 
2.0 Administration 
2.1 Applicability 
a)  The uses and buildings on all properties within the DRDC zoning classification shall conform exclusively to this section. Where this section is silent, the other appropriate sections of the City Code shall apply. 
b)  Table 2-1 (Applicability Matrix) shall determine which Subsections of the DRDC might apply to any proposed development. Not all Subsections will apply to every circumstance, but review each Subsection to determine need to adhere to those Subsections as necessary and to understand all required conditions of the DRDC. 
c)  Terms used throughout this Chapter are defined in Subsection 9 (Definitions). For those terms not defined in this Section, definitions within the general City Code shall apply. In the event of conflict with definitions within the general City Code, the definitions of this Section shall take precedence. 
d)  Where in conflict, numerical metrics shall take precedence over graphic metrics. 
2.2 Development Regulations 
a)  The development review process shall be required and administered subject to the requirements of Chapter 14, Article 3, Division 1, Section 14-207(b), except in cases of new construction which shall require Planning Commission approval through Section 14-207(a). In both cases, the requirements of Section 14-228(30) may generally be waived based on proportionality and the intent of this Code.

c)  Allowable Adjustments: The Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee may approve allowable adjustments within the limits and per the criteria listed in Table 2-2 (Allowable Adjustments Table). All allowable adjustments shall be considered "meeting the requirements of the DRDC" in accordance with City and State legislative requirements. In no circumstance shall the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee approve an allowable adjustment that results in: 
i)  An increase in overall project intensity or density; 
ii)  A change in permitted uses or mix of uses; 
iii)  A change in the required frontage designation; or 
iv)  A change in any required element of the DRDC Zoning Map and the DRDC beyond the thresholds established in Table 2-2 below. 
Table 2-2: Allowable Adjustments Table DRDC Standard Extent of Allowable Adjustment Permitted Criteria for Adjustment DRDC Zoning Map Area/Boundary of DRDC Zones No more than a 20% change (increase or decrease) in the area of any DRDC Zone (aggregate). Lots being changed shall be a part of a larger development needing common zoning for the project. Building Form and Development Standards Build to Zones and Setbacks No more than a 20% change in the maximum or minimum setback applicable or 5 feet whichever is greater. Changes to the Build to Zones and setbacks may only occur when they are caused by one or more of the following: 
 1. Need to accommodate existing buildings and structures on the lot that meet the overall intent and vision for redevelopment in the DRDC area; or 
 2. Need to accommodate other required modes of transportation (transit, bike, pedestrian), stormwater drainage, water quality, or low impact development (LID) elements on the site; or 
 3.  Need to accommodate overhead or underground utilities and/or easements; or 
 4. Need to preserve existing trees on the property. This adjustment is not mandatory for tree preservation, but for the allowance for preservation; or 
 5. Need to provide public amenities along the sidewalk (outdoor dining/seating, larger sidewalk, or other similar public amenities). Building Frontage No more than a 15% reduction in the required building frontage along each subject lot with Pedestrian-Friendly or General Frontage designation. Any reduction in the required building frontage shall be to address one or more of the following to accommodate: 
 1. Existing buildings and site elements; or 
 2. Other required transit, bike and pedestrian, stormwater drainage, or water quality elements on the site. Building Heights Increase in height of building for providing a public amenity. Height may be increased by one additional story in COM and IA Zones if a public open space is provided on-site. The public open space must meet the standards of the Public Open Space Types in Attachment 4 of this Section. Public Open Space may be privately owned and maintained. Sidewalk and Streetscape Standards Sidewalks, Street Trees, Street Lighting, and other streetscape standards may be adjusted based on the development context, street cross section or larger public infrastructure plan. Any changes to the streetscape standards shall be based on specific development context such as existing vegetation, natural features, drainage and fire safety. Required Parking Spaces Reduction in the number of required parking spaces. Reduction in the number of parking spaces shall be based on one or more of the following: 
 1. A shared parking plan for parking within 1,000 feet of the subject property; or 
 2. A parking study for the uses proposed on the site; or 
 3. A combination of the above. Other Any other numerical standard in the Section An adjustment up to 10% (increase or decrease). An adjustment of a numerical standard is needed to accommodate existing conditions. The proposed development still meets the intent of the DRDC Zone. Phased Developments Deferment of building frontage standards. Phased developments may defer building frontage requirements as long as they meet the Build to Zone and parking setback requirements.  
d)  Modifications: 
i)  The Rogers Board of Adjustments (BOA) shall first review projects that request a modification beyond the standards in the DRDC authorized above in Table 2-2 (Allowable Adjustments Table). 
ii)  The BOA shall review only the modification that exceeds the allowable adjustment within the DRDC and shall rule only in the case that this modification meets the following criteria: 
1.  The goals, intent and vision of the adopted Downtown Initiative Plan;

3.0 Schedule of Permitted Uses 
3.1 Applicability 
Due to the emphasis on urban form over land uses in the DRDC, general use categories have been identified by zone (Table 3-1: Schedule of Uses). 
a)  Use Determination: The Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee is responsible for categorizing all uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee shall place the proposed use under that use category. A use not specifically listed shall be prohibited unless it is found to be similar to another listed use as described using the criteria below. The Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee 's decision may be appealed to the PC for final determination. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee or designee may consider any other following relevant criteria, especially as it relates to any direct impacts on adjoining roadways and/or neighborhoods: 
i)  The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use; 
ii)  The relative number of employees; 
iii)  Hours of operation; 
iv)  Buildings and site arrangement; 
v)  The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use or uses; 
vi)  Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements; 
vii)  Relative amounts of sales; 
viii)  Transportation demand by all modes, including the number of vehicle, transit, and bike/walk trips generated and whether existing or proposed infrastructure is adequate to serve those trips;

4.0 Building Form and Development Standards 
Building form and development standards applicable to each DRDC zone are described in this Subsection. The images and graphics through this Subsection are provided as illustrative of intent and are advisory only. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific standards. 
In addition, the graphics used to illustrate the standards in each DRDC zone are NOT intended to indicate exact conditions within each DRDC zone. Rather, illustrations are conceptual and standards are to be applied based on the specific frontage types designated along the subject property or site. Also, the illustrations may depict other site elements to establish context and only the standards regulated by the specific Subsection shall apply. 
Building form graphics in this Subsection are NOT TO SCALE. 
4.1 General to All DRDC Zones 
a)  Building Frontage Designations: The Building Frontage designations are applied as depicted on the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan to specify certain building form and site development standards. Building frontages are classified into one of the following three categories: 
i)  Pedestrian Priority: 
1.  Pedestrian Priority Frontages are intended to provide the most pedestrian-friendly and contiguous development context. Buildings and sites along Pedestrian Priority Frontages shall be held to the highest standard of pedestrian-oriented design and few, if any, gaps shall be permitted in the "street wall." Breaks in the street wall may be permitted for courtyards, forecourts, sidewalk cafés, and pedestrian connections between the individual sites and the public sidewalk. These street frontages are the main retail, restaurant, entertainment streets or are important neighborhood connectors as identified in the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan. 
2.  The area between the building façade and property line or edge of any existing sidewalk along any street with Pedestrian Priority Frontage shall be designed such that the sidewalk width shall be the minimum of the designated street cross section and the remainder of any setback area shall be paved flush with the public sidewalk. Sidewalk cafés, public art, landscaping within tree-wells or planters may be incorporated within this area. 

Illustration showing requirements along Pedestrian Priority Frontages 
ii)  Pedestrian-Friendly - Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages are also intended to be pedestrian-oriented with a mostly contiguous development context. However, in some locations, where access to a General Frontage street or Alley is not available, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may need to accommodate driveways, parking, service/utility functions, and loading and unloading. In such cases, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may balance pedestrian orientation with automobile accommodation. Typically, they shall establish a hybrid development context that has a more pedestrian-supportive development context at street intersections and accommodates auto-related functions and surface parking in the middle of the block. Surface parking shall be screened from the roadway per Subsection 8.3 of this Section. Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages are designated on the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan. 
iii)  General - General Frontages are intended to accommodate more auto-oriented uses, surface parking, and service functions on a site with a more suburban/automobile orientation. The General Frontages shall be any frontage not designated as either a Pedestrian Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage on the Downtown Regional Center Zoning Plan. 

Illustration showing the application of Frontage Types and their related development context 
b)  Treatment of Street Intersections: 
i)  At the intersections of Pedestrian Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages, corner building street façades shall be built within the Build-to-Zone (BTZ) for a minimum of 30 feet from the intersection, along each street, or the width of the lot, whichever is less. 
ii)  Corners of buildings are permitted to have curved or chamfered forms, recessed entries or public open space at these corners. 
iii)  In the case of public open space at the corner, the building shall wrap along the public open space. 

Illustration showing minimum frontage requirements at an intersection of Pedestrian Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages 
iv)  Corner buildings may exceed the maximum building height by 25% along no more than 20% of the building frontage along each corresponding street façade.

Street design and connectivity is envisioned to support and balance automobile, bicycle, and walking trips in addition to becoming the "civic" space for development. The civic nature of streets will not only serve private redevelopment, but the community at large and the people who live in and use it. This Subsection establishes Context Sensitive Solutions for street design and connectivity and is intended to complement the City of Rogers Complete Streets Plan. 
6.2 Street Designation Classification 
In order to service multiple modes of transportation within an appropriate redevelopment context, streets within the DRDC area are designated by its classification. The Street Classification designation establishes standards for the actual cross section of the street. The Street Classification includes information on automobile, bicycle, pedestrian, and parking accommodation. It typically addresses the space allocation within the public right-of-way and its emphasis towards different modes of transportation. Table 6-1 identifies the Street Classification designations within the DRDC area and provides cross sections for the different Street Classifications. 
6.3 Street Standards 
Table 6-1 and associated cross sections shall establish standards for all elements within the public right-of-way including travel lanes, on street parking, bicycle accommodation, streetscape, street landscape, and sidewalks. The standards in the City's Subdivision Ordinance shall apply to the extent that they do not conflict with the standards in this Subsection and the vision for Downtown Rogers.

7.0 Open Space Standards 
7.1 Purpose and Intent 
The illustrative vision for Downtown Rogers recognizes the importance of providing a network of open spaces with passive and active recreation opportunities. The open space network will be serviced by an interconnected network of sidewalks, trails and paths for pedestrians and bicyclists alike, providing desired amenities and facilities for residents and visitors to Downtown Rogers. 
Much of the publicly owned and maintained open space already exists in Downtown Rogers, with the Frisco Park in the center of Downtown, connectivity to ancillary public open space is essential for the public open space to be activated in conjunction with redevelopment. Ideal connections through sidewalks, trails and paths are identified in the Downtown Rogers Implementation Plan. The Open Space Standards identifies the variety of public open space types that are available and appropriate in Downtown Rogers and serve as a means to categorize the various public open space types that will be used in the area. 
7.2 Open Space Classification 
Within the DRDC area, all Open Space shall fall into one of the following classifications: 
a)  Public Open Space: Open air or unenclosed to semi-unenclosed areas intended for public access and use. These areas range in size and development and serve to complement and connect surrounding land uses and code requirements. Public Open Space may be publicly or privately owned and maintained. 
b)  Private Common Open Space: Privately owned and maintained outdoor, unenclosed or semi-unenclosed area located on the ground or on a terrace, deck, porch or roof. This open space is designed and accessible for outdoor gathering, recreation and landscaping and is intended for use by the residents, employees, and/or visitors to the development. 
7.3 Open Space Requirements 
a)  All non-residential development in the Commercial Mixed Use or Civic Mixed Use Zone shall provide four square feet of Public Open Space or Private Common Open Space for every 100 square feet of non-residential space or fraction thereof. This standard shall only apply to all site plans two acres in size or larger. 
b)  All residential development in the DRDC area shall meet the Private Common Open Space standards established in this Subsection. Table 7-1 establishes the Private Common Open Space requirement based on the proposed intensity of residential development. Residential projects numbering less than eight dwelling units per acre are not required to provide Private Common Open Space. 
c)  Any Public Open Space provided in a development shall identify and program the Public Open Space per the palette of open space types in Attachment 4 of this Subsection.

The minimum streetscape width may vary depending on available right-of-way, but in all instances the minimum sidewalk zone width requirement shall apply. Variations in the streetscape width may be approved by the City Planner with appeals of the planner's decision heard by the Board of Adjustments. The Streetscape Zone shall consist of the following, see figures below: 
i)  Furnishing Zone: The furnishing zone is intended for the placement of function street items. These items include street trees, street furniture, lighting, waste receptacles, fire equipment, signage, vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment and other elements that may disrupt pedestrian activity. In residential areas, the furnishing zone may be fully landscaped, whereas in mixed use or commercial areas, the furnishing zone may be fully paved. These items may be placed in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility. 
ii)  Sidewalk Zone: The sidewalk zone shall be hardscape and shall be located adjacent to the furnishing zone. The sidewalk zone shall comply with ADA and local accessibility standards and shall be unobstructed by any permanent or non-permanent element for the required minimum width and a minimum height of eight feet.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- The Downtown Rogers Development Code (DRDC), as adopted by Ord. No. 15-102, § 1(Exh. A), on July 28, 2015, has been set out herein as new § 14-715. The subsection numbering and basic format has been maintained inasmuch as possible. Attachments 1-4 to said ordinance are included at the end of this section. Former §§ 14-715-14-734 have been renumbered as §§ 14-716-14-735. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 14-716. - CU condominium unit district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The condominium unit district is established to allow multiple ownership of a building and or property utilizing the zero lot line and townhouse concepts. This district must be used in combination with another district to establish the land use limitations and the maximum density of development. These district combinations shall be located in those areas of the City where adequate facilities either exist prior to development or can be provided in conjunction with development and where the proposed development is compatible with the surrounding environment. 
(b)  District combinations. The CU district may be used in combinations with all districts. 
(c)  Density and use limitations. The density and land use shall be the same as the density and land use permitted in the district used in combinations with the CU district. 
(d)  Other requirements. All of the other requirements such as height, area, regulations, off-street parking, and signs shall be the same as the district with which the CU district is being combined. The only exception is the minimum land area for use of the CU district shall be one acre. 
(e)  Large-scale development. All CU district designated development whether new or modification shall be subject to the requirements of the City large-scale development code (article III of this chapter). 
(f)  Protective covenants. At the time of application for a large-scale development plan approval for a CU designated district, the developer shall submit protective covenants or restrictions which shall be applicable to the development and which shall provide for a means of financing the maintenance of any common areas and buildings. In addition, the protective covenants or restrictions shall limit the use of the property and improvements so as to prohibit extraordinary or unusual risks to persons or property in the development caused by the particular use of any unit of the development. Said covenants, as approved by the commission, shall be properly recorded prior to issuance of any building permit. 
(Code 1997, § 130-39; Ord. No. 04-56, § 2(27), 5-25-2004; Ord. No. 15-102, § 1(Exh. A), 7-28-2015; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-717. - PUD planned unit development. 
(a)  General considerations. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. A planned unit development (PUD) is a comprehensively planned residential, commercial, office, or office-warehouse land development project in which the standard requirements of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations may be varied to permit design flexibility, building clustering, grouping of open space, increased density, and alternative to public facility improvements. PUD is considered an "additional" zoning district designation and shall allow the City of Rogers to require compliance with the below listed provisions as a condition preceding any development of the land so zoned. Any such designation (Example - "PUD-C2") shall be restricted to both the underlying zone (C-2) and the additional requirements of the PUD designation in its entirety. If there is a conflict between any regulations or requirements contained in the PUD final plan and the underlying zoning, the conditions of the additional PUD designation shall prevail. The PUD zoning district designation shall be submitted to City Council only upon approval of the PUD final plan by the Planning Commission. The final plan, and all of its relevant contents, shall be attached as an exhibit to the relevant zoning ordinance(s) when presented to the City Council and, if approved, shall become fixed requirements directly tied to the zoning and development of the subject property as long at the PUD zoning designation(s) remain unchanged. A PUD zoning designation Ordinance shall not be considered by the City Council without an attached final plan previously approved by the Planning Commission. Approval of a PUD zoning designation and final plan do not relieve the property owner of the requirements of large-scale development plans or subdivision regulations if otherwise required City code. 
(2)  Approval considerations. To be approved, a planned unit development (PUD) must comply with the provisions of this section and must achieve at least one of the following purposes: 
a.  More efficient use of land; 
b.  More efficient use of public facilities; 
c.  More usable open space through structure grouping and other design techniques; and 
d.  Preservation of appropriate natural and/or physical features. 
(3)  Potential reasons for the denial of a PUD. The Planning Commission in its review of the concept plan may deny the use of the PUD provision for any of the following reasons: 
a.  The PUD plan did not achieve the stated purposes; 
b.  The proposed PUD plan was incomplete; 
c.  The PUD plan was incompatible with the surrounding area; 
d.  Sufficient public facilities and services were not available to the proposed site; and 
e.  The proposed development would create or compound a traffic hazard. 
(4)  Permitted uses . 
(A)  Uses allowed by right . All uses allowed by right within the underlying zoning district shall be allowed by right within the PUD. 
(B)  Conditional uses . 
(i)  A use that is not permitted under subdivision (a)(4)(A) of this section may be approved as a conditional use in the PUD zoning district if the use is allowed in any zoning district under this Article. 
(ii)  The Planning Commission may consider a request for conditional use under subdivision (a)(4)(B)(i) of this section: 
(a)  Using the procedure established in section 14-723; or 
(b)  With the PUD final plan if the conditional use is requested as a part of the PUD final plan. 
(iii)  If a conditional use is requested with the PUD final plan, the provisions of section 14-723 will apply except that: 
(a)  The notice provided under this section shall be sufficient notice of the conditional use request; and 
(b)  The applicant shall not be required to submit an application or pay a fee in addition to the PUD final plan submission and fee under this section. 
(5)  PUD size. The minimum land area for a PUD is five acres. 
(6)  Density. 
a.  The dwelling unit density shall be the density allowed in the zoning district which governs the underlying zoning designation unless the Planning Commission approves an increase under subdivision (a)(6)b. of this section. 
b.  The following density bonus may be provided for additional open space. If the underlying zoning district (R-SF, R-MF) provides a density bonus or increase for open space, the property owner may receive an additional density "bonus" as provided for in the chart contained in this subsection (a)(6)b. of this section. The required open space for the relative density of the underlying zones is required to exist in the PUD as a whole but not necessarily only in the individual underlying zoning designation. (Example - a PUD with 10 acres of RMF requiring 40% open space and 10 acres of C2 requiring 20% of open space would require a total of 6 acres of open space for the entire PUD project. The developer would not necessarily be required to put 4 acres of open space in the RMF area and 2 acres of open space in the C2 area but may place the open space anywhere within the PUD as long as the total open space area requirements are met for the entire PUD - hereafter referred to as "Combined PUD Open Space.") It is the option of the owner/developer to build by placing the "traditional" amount of open space in the respective underlying zones or to build in the "Combined PUD Open Space" manner listed above. If an owner or developer choses to build using the "Combined PUD Open Space" manner and opts to build the PUD in "phases," the undeveloped area with the highest level of required open space required shall be build first in time. The preceding requirement may be specifically waived by the Planning Commission based on other considerations, assurances, or guarantees sufficient to ensure that future "phase" development will meet the required open space percentage required of the entire PUD. 
Additional Open Space Percentage - Authorized in addition to any underlying density increases allowed for open space density increases given in the underlying zoning designation 
(Percentage open space increase) Allowed Increased Units per Acre 10 3 15 5 20 7  
(7)  PUD expansion; variance. The Planning Commission may vary the requirements of this article, or of the City's zoning regulations, or of the City's subdivision regulations: 
a.  Due to practical difficulties caused by terrain or other physical features; or 
b.  If the proposal offered by the developer protects the public health, safety, and welfare better than development according to the zoning regulations or the subdivision regulations. Any such variance shall be stated in written form on the PUD final plan, and shall be recorded with the final plat. 
(8)  Enforcement. No building permit shall be issued for any development which proposes a change from the approved PUD final plan. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the PUD final plan, along with any necessary covenants or POA documents, has been approved and filed of record with the appropriate Benton County Clerk's Office. All decisions by Department of Community Development related to PUDs may be appealed to the Planning Commission by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer within ten (10) days of notification of the contested staff decision. The contested matter shall then be placed on the next available Planning Commission agenda for consideration by the Planning Commissioners. Any Planning Commission decisions related to PUDs may be appealed to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer within ten (10) days of notification of the contested Planning Commission meeting where the contested decision was rendered. The owner of the proposed development or their agent, or any property owner that was, or would be required, to be given notice under section (a)(10) below, may appeal under these provisions. The notice procedures for appeal from the decision of either Department of Community Development or the Planning Commission shall be the same as for an appeal for a rezoning decision. 
(9)  Public hearing. For all PUDs, a public hearing shall automatically be called coincidental with the concept plan or final plan review by the Planning Commission. Said public hearing shall be held following the same requirements, fees, and procedures for a rezone hearing. 
(10)  Notification. The developer must notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested, anyone who leases or owns property within 300 feet of the perimeter of the PUD, that a PUD proposal is pending. Said notification shall be mailed 15 days prior to the meeting at which the Planning Commission is to review the concept plan. The developer shall provide a copy of the notice of public hearing and the green receipt cards to the Planning Commission. A copy of the mailing list and the green receipt cards from the mailout shall be furnished to the Planning Commission at the public hearing. 
(11)  Appeals. Staff decisions rendered under this section may be appealed to the Planning Commission by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer within 10 days' notice of the adverse staff decision. Any Planning Commission decisions rendered under this section may be appealed to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer within 10 days' notice of the Planning Commission's adverse decision. If the nature of the adverse decision being appealed was an element under this code section that required public hearing and/or public notice, the same notice requirements applicable to the initial decision shall apply for the appeal hearing. 
(b)  Review procedure. 
(1)  PUD Concept plan. Whenever a developer intends to develop a PUD under the provisions of this article, he shall submit a concept plan and request for conditional use, if applicable, prior to initiating the detailed work involved in the preparation of a PUD final plan. The purpose of the concept plan is to allow the developer, the Planning Commission, and the general public to discuss the proposed development before a great deal of time and money are committed to any project. Within 30 days of receipt of a PUD conceptual plan by the Department of Community Development, such office shall review the proposal and schedule a public hearing before the Planning Commission, with appropriate notice to the developer and designated property owners. With public hearing review and the Department of Community Development recommendations the Planning Commission will approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions the conceptual plan. Any reasons for disapproval, or the conditions of approval, shall be put in writing and provided to the developer. If approved, or approved with conditions, the developer will be free to proceed with a PUD final plan. 
The concept plan shall include the following: 
a.  Total area to be included in the PUD; 
b.  Topography (USGS two foot intervals is sufficient); 
c.  Public facilities to be provided; 
d.  Areas with potential flood problems, wetlands, or any other features presenting development difficulty; 
e.  Unique physical features; 
f.  Nature of surrounding development; 
g.  Nature and extent of tree cover;

o.  Submission of any required filing fee. 
(2)  PUD Final plan . Once the concept plan had been approved, a final plan shall be submitted to Department of Community Development staff for consideration. If staff determines that the final plan contains the appropriate required information, Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee shall cause the final plan to be added to the next available Planning Commission meeting that allows for notice requirement compliance. A final PUD plan shall contain the following information: 
a.  An estimate of the number of units for sale and lease; 
b.  Identification of ALL open space, including location and size (acres or square feet), with all open space clearly labeled as "non-buildable"; 
c.  Identification and location of all nonresidential structures proposed in the PUD; 
d.  All information relating to the establishment, operation, and perpetuation of the property owners association, if applicable; 
e.  Proposed protective covenants, if applicable; 
f.  Natural features; 
g.  Written request for any desired variance from the zoning or subdivision regulations; 
h.  Location, and size of all proposed parking areas and all pertinent information relating to access and maintenance.

The method for maintenance shall be in conformance with the requirements of subsections (d), (e), and (f) below, if applicable; 
i.  Location of recreational facilities; 
j.  Proposed treatment and ownership of open spaces; 
k.  Relationship of dwelling units, recreation facilities and open spaces, including building setbacks;

o.  Draft protective covenants and property owners' association (POA) agreement, if applicable. Any property owners' association agreement shall apply to all property owners within the PUD and the protective covenants shall so provide; 
p.  Location, and size of all proposed parking areas and all pertinent information relating to access and maintenance. Maintenance of parking areas in nonresidential PUD shall be the responsibility of the landowner, or a property owners' association and shall not be the responsibility of the City. The method for maintenance shall be established by the PUD covenants; 
q.  The developer shall submit paper copies in conformance with the Department of Community Development's current "submittal requirement list," along with a digital copy, of the concept plan to the Department of Community Development; and 
r.  Submission of any required filing fee. 
(c)  Changes to an approved PUD. 
(1)  Previously existing PUD preceding current regulations. 
a.  After passage of these provisions, if a PUD plan that was approved PRIOR to the passage of these provisions comes back before the Planning Commission for modification or revision, the following issues shall be considered by the Commission when determining whether to allow the modification or revision of the pre-existing PUD plan. 
1.  Whether the modification or revision meets the general intent of this code section. 
2.  Whether the modification or revision will adversely affect any currently built/existing sections of the PUD in question. 
3.  Whether the requested modification or revision are within their authority to grant pursuant to subsection (a)(7) above.

c.  Approval. If the modification(s) or revision(s) are approved as a part of a concept plan submitted in accordance with the requirements above, the owner or developer shall then submit a final plan for consideration in compliance with the remaining requirements of this code section. 
(2)  Modification to a PUD approved under current regulations. 
a.  If a PUD plan that was approved AFTER the passage of these provisions is brought back before the Planning Commission for modification or revision, the following procedures shall be followed: 
1.  If only a concept plan has been approved, the concept plan shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission with the proposed changes for consideration following all requirements as if it was a new concept plan submittal. 
2.  If a final plan has been approved but not accepted by City Council, the final plan shall be re-submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration of the proposed modification or revision as if it was a new final plan submittal. 
3.  If a final plan has been approved and adopted along with a zoning designation by City Council, the final plan shall be re-submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration of the proposed modification or revision as if it was a new final plan submittal. If approved, it shall then be submitted to City Council attached to a new zoning Ordinance as required in subsection (a)(1) above. The City Council will then consider the new final plan and zoning Ordinance as if it were being first submitted under subsection (a)(1). 
(3)  Notice requirements. 
a.  Any notice requirement contained in this code section for the submittal of an initial concept plan or final plan shall also be required if a concept plan or final plan are resubmitted for consideration as described in subsections (c)(1) and (2) listed above.

2.  Subbase, base and paving shall meet City standards. 
3.  An adequate storm drainage system in accordance with the City drainage ordinance and master drainage plan, and approved by the Department of Community Development shall be required for all private streets. 
4.  Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all streets. 
5.  Maximum density served by a cul-de-sac shall be 40 units. Maximum density served by a loop street shall be 80 units. 
6.  The PUD final plan of the planned development shall designate each private street as a private street. 
7.  Maintenance of streets, private open spaces, and street lights shall be the responsibility of the developer/owner, if solely owned, or of a neighborhood property owners association (POA) if owned by multiple property owners and shall not be the responsibility of the City. The method for maintenance of streets, open spaces and street lights, and a maintenance fund for those purposes, shall be established by recorded covenants if the PUD is divided into separate parcels or lots and owned by multiple property owners. 
(8)  Width. The width of private streets shall meet City standards unless varied by approval of the Planning Commission.

(12)  Height. The height regulations of the various zoning districts shall apply. 
(13)  Natural features . Natural features such as bluffs and streams existing on a proposed PUD site shall be identified on both the concept plan and PUD final plan. Every effort shall be made to retain these natural features in open space. 
(14)  View protection. The Planning Commission shall have the right to establish special height and/or positioning restrictions where scenic views are involved and shall have the right to ensure the perpetuation of those views both within and without the PUD through requirements in the protective covenants restrictions. 
(e)  Residential Open space. 
(1)  Generally. Despite any density allowances contained in city code section 14-703 (RMF zoning) to the contrary, each PUD shall provide at least 30 percent of the total land area within the residential part of the PUD as usable private or public open space unless the developer opts to build using the "Combined PUD Open Space" manner allowed by subsection (a)(6)b. above. A minimum of at least one-half of the 30 percent open space shall be contiguous. Land within the floodplain and designated wetland may be counted as no more than 50 percent of the usable open space. Any area intended for active open space shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide in its smallest dimension. Active open space is defined as an area intended for rigorous activity such as tennis, baseball, badminton, and other games requiring physical exertion. Passive open space may be any size. Passive open space is defined as an area intended for tranquil activities such as walking, sitting, observing and the less active games like shuffleboard and croquet. The following shall not be considered as usable open space: 
a.  The surface area of parking lots including driveways; 
b.  The area occupied by structures excluding structures used for recreational purposes; 
c.  Any lot intended for private ownership, excluding front yards for residential structures; and 
d.  Street surface area. 
(2)  City assumes public open space. All land proposed for public open space shall be considered by the City Council prior to approval of the PUD final plan and zoning. Such open space shall be transferred to the City contemporaneously with approval of the PUD final plan and zoning if said land is acceptable to the City Council. Such open spaces accepted by the City Council shall thereafter become the maintenance responsibility of the City. 
(3)  Perpetuation of private open space . If the private open space was not subject to a POA or covenants due to sole ownership of the development, the City may consider a lack of perpetuation of the private open space a zoning violation if said private open space requirement was adopted as part of the PUD final plan and therefore made a zoning requirement. In addition to any other criminal penalties that may be prescribed by state law, a violation may be subject to the penalties set for in City Code section 1-5. 
(4)  Maintenance of private open space . The maintenance of all private open space shall be the responsibility of the developer or of a property owners association and the method for maintenance and maintenance fund shall be established in the PUD covenants. The covenants shall provide that in the event private open space is not maintained as required by the covenants and this ordinance, the City shall have the right (but shall not be required) to maintain said open space and to charge all maintenance costs incurred by the City to the property owners within the PUD on a pro rata basis according to assessed valuation for ad valorem tax purposes and shall have a lien on the real property within the PUD for such costs. 
(f)  Commercial open space. 
(1)  Generally. Each PUD shall provide at least 20 percent of the total land area within the commercial part of the PUD as usable private or public open space unless the developer opts to build using the "Combined PUD Open Space" manner allowed by subsection (a)(6)b. above. A minimum of at least one-half of the 20 percent open space shall be contiguous (in continuous connection). Land within the floodplain up to and including (ten-year frequency) and wetland may be counted as no more than 30 percent of the usable open space. Any area intended for active open space shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide in the smallest dimension. Active open space is defined as an area intended for rigorous activity such as tennis, baseball, badminton, and other games requiring physical exertion. Passive open space may be any size. Passive open space is defined as an area intended for tranquil activities such as walking, sitting, observing, and the less active games like shuffleboard and croquet. The following shall not be considered as usable open space: 
a.  The surface area of parking lots including driveways; 
b.  The area occupied by structures excluding structures used for recreational purposes; 
c.  Any lot intended for private ownership; and 
d.  Street surface area. 
(2)  City assumes public open space . All land proposed for public open space shall be considered by the City Council prior to approval of the PUD final plan and zoning. Such open space shall be transferred to the City contemporaneously with approval of the PUD final plan and zoning if said land is acceptable to the City Council. Such open spaces accepted by the City Council shall thereafter become the maintenance responsibility of the City. 
(3)  Perpetuation of private open space. If the private open space was not subject to a POA or covenants due to sole ownership of the development, the City may consider a lack of perpetuation of the private open space a zoning violation if said private open space requirement was adopted as part of the PUD final plan and therefore made a zoning requirement. In addition to any other criminal penalties that may be prescribed by state law, a violation may be subject to the penalties set for in City Code section 1-5. 
(4)  Maintenance of private open space. The maintenance of all private open space shall be the responsibility of the developer or of a property owners association and the method for maintenance and maintenance fund shall be established in the PUD covenants. The covenants shall provide that in the event private open space is not maintained as required by the covenants and this ordinance, the City shall have the right (but shall not be required) to maintain said open space and to charge all maintenance costs incurred by the City to the property owners within the PUD on a pro rata basis according to assessed valuation for ad valorem tax purposes and shall have a lien on the real property within the PUD for such costs. 
(g)  Proof of compliance. 
(1)  No large-scale development plan or subdivision plat concerning land developed under this section of the City code shall be accepted for review until all required covenants and POA documentation have been filed and properly recorded with the appropriate county clerk's office.

(Code 1997, § 130-41; Ord. No. 04-56, § 2(29), 5-25-2004; Ord. No. 15-102, § 1(Exh. A), 7-28-2015; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-720. - Nonconforming lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of structures and premises. 
(a)  Statement of intent and purpose. Within the districts established by this article or amendments that may later be adopted, if there exist lots, structures, or uses of land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance from which this article was derived was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment, it is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of the chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(b)  Nonconforming use of structure and land in combination. Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building premises or additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
(c)  Buildings and structures where construction has begun. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this article is derived and upon which actual building construction has been carried out diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(d)  Nonconforming lots of record. 
(1)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this article. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of adjustments. 
(2)  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and if all or parts of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this article, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirements stated in this article. 
(e)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on areas, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(2)  Single-family nonconforming structures in nonresidential zones may be allowed to expand only by Planning Commission or Board of Adjustment action.

Sec. 14-721. - Application of district regulations. 
(a)  No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with all the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
(b)  No building or structure hereafter erected or altered shall exceed the height, bulk, area, percent coverage, density, open space, and yard requirements established in this chapter. No land shall be used other than in accordance with the requirements of this article. No existing yard or lot shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements of this chapter, unless approved by the appropriate City authority, if applicable. Yards and lots created after the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall meet the minimum requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  No part of a yard, lot, other open space, parking or loading area required for one building, structure or use shall be counted for another building, structure or use. 
(d)  All land area annexed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be zoned upon annexation as A-1 district unless the annexing ordinance of the City zones the property otherwise. 
(e)  Any lands subject to the jurisdiction of this article but not specifically included shall be considered A-1 district until rezoned otherwise. 
(f)  Any zoning district line which splits a lot of record existing at the time of passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be extended by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee to the whole lot line, provided the lot is one acre or less. 
(g)  Uses which were inadvertently omitted from the schedule of uses and new uses created after passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be added to the schedule of uses by a majority vote of the entire membership of the Planning Commission. 
(Code 1997, § 130-43; Ord. No. 04-56, § 2(31), 5-25-2004; Ord. No. 15-102, § 1(Exh. A), 7-28-2015; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-722. - General district regulations. 
(a)  Visibility at intersections. At any intersection within the City, nothing will be erected, planted, placed or allowed to grow which impedes vision at the intersection between the height of two and one-half feet and ten feet above the highest elevation of the road surface cross section of the intersection streets. This restriction shall apply in a triangle shaped area running 25 feet in each direction from the intersection curblines or roadway surface lines and a line connecting those two points. 
(b)  Multiple structures on one lot. More than one principal permitted structure shall be allowed on one lot in any zoning district provided each structure shall meet all zoning requirements as if it were a separate lot, unless said requirements are otherwise waived, if applicable, by the appropriate authority. 
(c)  Access to public streets. Every structure hereafter erected or moved shall be located on a lot which has frontage on a designated public or private street. 
(d)  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed on any lot in any district provided that no accessory use shall be allowed in any required yard area or setback. Accessory uses shall not be established prior to the principal use without Planning Commission approval. 
(e)  Height exceptions. Certain building accessories and other structures are exempt from the height regulations of this article. Building accessories would include steeples, spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, heating and cooling systems, ventilators, and chimneys. The structures would include antennas, watertanks, chimneys, and smokestacks. If the height of any building accessory or structure at its proposed location on the property exceeds the distance to the nearest property line, that building or structure shall be reviewed and approved or denied by the Planning Commission. No freestanding symbol, sculpture, monument, or non-habitable structure may be taller than 70 feet at the highest point from the ground. 
(Code 1997, § 130-44; Ord. No. 04-56, § 2(32), 5-25-2004; Ord. No. 15-102, § 1(Exh. A), 7-28-2015; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-723. - Conditional uses. 
(a)  Uses listed in the schedule of uses as "conditional in district" may be approved by the Planning Commission after a public hearing subject to the following: 
(1)  Filing of an application by the property owner stating the use and district requested and payment of an application fee; 
(2)  Written notification to all property owners within 300 feet of the property by certified mail, return receipt requested, publication of a public hearing notice in a local newspaper 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, and placement of a sign on the property by the Department of Community Development which gives notice of a public hearing 15 days prior to the public hearing; 
(3)  Consideration by the Planning Commission of the following factors: 
a.  Whether the use is a conditional use in the district requested and that the property under application is zoned correctly; 
b.  Whether the use would be compatible with the adjacent property and uses would not set a precedent contrary to the City land use plan; 
c.  Whether all other zoning requirements can be met; and 
d.  Whether ingress and egress for the proposed use will create a traffic hazard. 
(b)  The Planning Commission may deny a conditional use if in its opinion any of the above conditions cannot be met. 
(c)  A conditional use once denied shall not be heard again (for the same or substantially similar conditional use on the same property) within a period of one year unless the applicant can show how the Planning Commission erred in its determination or that new information, not available at the time of the public hearing, has been discovered. A majority vote of the entire Planning Commission shall be required to rehear any conditional use. 
(d)  As a part of approving a conditional use, the Planning Commission may add conditions which will in its opinion carry out the preamble of the zoning ordinance. 
(e)  No decision of the Planning Commission granting a conditional use permit under this section shall become effective until after an elapsed period of ten days from the date of the Planning Commission meeting during which the request was heard. During this ten-day period, an appeal of the decision, whether to grant or to deny the permit, may be taken to the City Council by filing a letter of appeal with the City Clerk-Treasurer. The letter shall state the nature of, and reasons for, the appeal. The following persons or entities may appeal: The applicant, a property owner, or leaseholder who owns or leases property within 300 feet of the property to which the conditional use applies. The City Council shall hear such appeal and consider all relevant evidence prior to rendering a final decision. The City Council may vote to grant or deny the conditional use permit. 
(f)  Once a conditional use is approved, that conditional use is personal to the individual applicant and is limited to the location to which it was approved and may only be changed to another conditional use through further action of the Planning Commission or City Council. A conditional use may be changed to a use by right in the zoning district at any time by appropriate action of the Planning Commission. Once a conditional use is approved, that use may continue so long as it abides by the findings of this subsection and any special conditions placed upon the use by the Planning Commission or City Council. The use may continue as stated above indefinitely, if no time duration restriction is added as a condition of the actual granting of the conditional use permit and, the permit-holder does not violate the terms and conditions of the permit. 
(g)  If a complaint is filed with the Planning Commission by an adjoining property owner or City employee concerning an alleged violation of a conditional use, the Planning Commission shall notify the holder of the conditional use permit of the complaint and shall schedule a public hearing. If, after the public hearing, the Planning Commission finds that a violation exists or has repeatedly existed in the past, depending on the nature of the violation, the Planning Commission may: 
(1)  Vote to discontinue the conditional use; 
(2)  Take no action if the violation has been remedied to their satisfaction; or 
(3)  Vote to modify the terms of the existing conditional use permit in a manner likely to address any further similar violations. 
    The conditional use permit holder shall be notified of the action of the Planning Commission and shall have 15 days from the date of the notice to discontinue the conditional use or file an appeal with the City Council. 
(h)  The filing of an appeal stays all proceedings and the City Council shall make the final determination as to the alleged violation(s) and the subsequent action on the conditional use permit. 
(i)  Certain conditional uses which are temporary in nature such as carnival, religious revival, circus, amusement park, fruit/vegetable stand, and other similar outdoor enterprises and real estate sales offices in a developing subdivision may be permitted by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee following the filing of an application and payment of a permit fee. The Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee shall specify on the application the hours of operation and duration of the use. All such uses such as carnival, circus, and other outdoor activities, which involve lights and noise, shall not be allowed any closer than 500 feet to a dwelling unit.

Sec. 14-732. - Uptown Rogers Development Code (URDC). 
1.0 Purpose and Intent 
The purpose of the Uptown Rogers Development Code (URDC) is to shape greenfield development and infill within the Uptown Rogers area to encourage excellent urban design, walkability, efficient use of land, and commercial resilience to firmly establish Uptown Rogers as a regional urban center. The URDC accomplishes this by: 
a)  Providing architectural flexibility that encourages innovative and inspiring design while preserving and enhancing the existing development character of established uptown commercial, residential, and mixed-use areas. 
b)  Establishing a context-based approach to planning and development, based on transitions rather than buffers, that facilitates traditional form-based interfaces between high- and low-intensity areas to ensure compatibility of uses and scale, mixed-use where feasible, and pedestrian-oriented design. 
c)  Creating appropriate zones to implement the vision for different areas of uptown-Uptown Core Mixed Use, Uptown Commercial Mixed Use, Uptown Entertainment, and Uptown Neighborhood Transition. 
d)  Providing a clear and understandable regulatory environment through the establishment of clearly articulated use and development standards; clear review, approval, and appeals processes for all development; and maximize ability for staff approval for submissions that meet the requirements of this Section. 
1.1 Uptown Regional Center Zoning Plan 
Within any area subject to the approved area of the URDC, City Code Section 14-716 becomes mandatory. It shall establish the following zones for all properties within the URDC area: 
a)  Establishment of URDC Zones: The URDC area is distinguished into different zones. Each zone is intended to respond to distinct urban aspects within Uptown Rogers and is based on the vision for the different zones within the URDC area. Each zone shall establish use and building form standards including standards for building height, mass, placement, functional design and parking. The Uptown Regional Center Zoning Plan classifies all lots within the URDC area into one of the following four zones: 
i.  Uptown Core Mixed Use (U-COR)-The purpose of the Uptown Core Mixed Use zone is to allow high-intensity, high-density urban mixed-use development characterized by pedestrian-priority streetscapes, inviting storefront, ground level retail and other commercial services, and upper floor office and residential uses. City blocks shall incorporate on-street parking, parking garages that are located so that they are internalized and do not dominate the development context, and public spaces that are connected by a walkable street network. Thereby, U-COR allows for all essential elements of live-work-play within walking distance, provides the most efficient use of land, and is designed to accommodate multi-modal transportation including car, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit. 
ii.  Uptown Commercial Mixed Use (U-COM)-The purpose of the Uptown Commercial Mixed Use zone is to allow relatively dense, pedestrian-friendly, primarily commercial mixed-use development that retains many of the characteristics of the U-COR zone while allowing more flexibility with respect to building disposition, single-use form, off-street parking options, and increased setbacks. U-COM attains increased density over traditional, single-use (strip mall or office park) form through shared parking and maximum parking requirements, shared access, maximum setbacks, pedestrian connectivity between adjacent properties, the use of boulevards, and public spaces. 
iii.  Uptown Entertainment (U-ENT)-The purpose of the Uptown Entertainment zone is to allow the development of large entertainment venues such as concert pavilions and sports facilities within the Uptown area and compatible ancillary uses for such venues. The intent is for these venues to retain pedestrian connectivity to the rest of the Uptown regional center, maximize the use of on-street and other off-site parking, provide for a variety of uses, and present a high level of architectural excellence that enhances the overall character of the URDC area. 
iv.  Uptown Neighborhood Transition (U-NBT)-The purpose of the Uptown Neighborhood Transition zone is to provide medium- to high-density residential infill between the other URDC zones and surrounding existing residential neighborhoods. U-NBT development is typically characterized by residential structures that are single-family, 2- to 3-stories, with very small or zero side setbacks, such as brownstones, townhomes, garden homes, or similar housing types that normally feature front on-street parking and rear- or side-entry garages. 
b)  Street Designations: The streets within the URDC area shall be classified by their street type in coordination with the Master Street Plan and the context of the surrounding development. Street cross sections shall address vehicular lane widths, number of lanes, pedestrian accommodation, street tree requirements, on-street parking, and parkway and median standards. These standards are laid out in Subsection 6 (Street Design Standards). Streets within the URDC area shall complement the Complete Streets Plan for the City of Rogers. 
c)  Building Frontage Standards: Building Frontage designations shall classify and regulate the required amount of building frontage required for a development based on the vision for development context. Building frontages are categorized into one of three types: 
i.  Pedestrian-Priority Frontage has the highest quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Focus is on wider sidewalks, ample clear space, appropriate street furniture, adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area. Building will be required to address the pedestrian area and provide a higher quality of commercial design standards. Curb cuts shall be limited, allowing for their utilization where they support particular uses without dominating the pedestrian-priority context such as porte-cochere entrances for hotels. 
ii.  Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage has a middle quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Focus is on adequate sidewalks, ample clear space, continuous walkability, adequate lighting and limited vehicular conflict points within the streetscape area. Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages lead to Pedestrian-Priority Frontages and expand connections to these areas into adjacent neighborhoods. 
iii.  General Frontage has a basic quality standard for pedestrian-oriented building design. Any frontage not labeled as a Pedestrian-Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly is considered a General Frontage. Focus is on required pedestrian access, adequate clear space, select locations for street furniture, adequate lighting, screening, and safe vehicular-pedestrian interactions within the streetscape area. 
d)  Public Open Space Designation : Public Open Space within the URDC shall be designated according to the development standards for each zone. Detailed standards for Public Open Space or improvement to existing Public Open Space are included in Subsection 7 (Open Space Standards). These standards include general character, typical size, frontage requirements and typical uses within these public open spaces. 
2.0 Administration 
2.1 Applicability 
a)  The uses and buildings on all properties within a URDC zoning district shall conform exclusively to this section. Where this section is silent, the other appropriate sections of the City Code shall apply. 
b)  Table 2.1 (Applicability Matrix) shall determine which Subsections of the URDC might apply to any proposed development. Not all Subsections will apply to every circumstance, but review each Subsection to determine need to adhere to those Subsections as necessary and to understand all required conditions of the URDC.

c)  Allowable Adjustments: The Director of Community Development or his or her designee may approve allowable adjustments within the limits and per the criteria listed in Table 2-2 (Allowable Adjustments Table). All allowable adjustments shall be considered "meeting the requirements of the URDC" in accordance with City and State legislative requirements. In no circumstance shall the Director of Community Development or his or her designee approve an allowable adjustment that results in: 
i.  An increase in overall project intensity or density beyond what would otherwise be allowed or was otherwise approved through normal variance processes; 
ii.  A change in permitted uses or mix of uses that would otherwise require rezoning action or an approved Conditional Use Permit; 
iii.  A change in the required frontage designation; or 
iv.  A change in any required element of the Uptown Regional Center Zoning Plan and the URDC beyond the thresholds established in Table 2-2 below. 
Table 2-2: Allowable Adjustments Table URDC Standard Extent of Allowable Adjustment Permitted Criteria for Adjustment Uptown Regional Center Zoning Plan Area/Boundary of URDC Zones No more than a 20% change (increase or decrease) in the area of any URDC zone (aggregate). Lots being changed shall be a part of a larger development needing common zoning for the project. Building Form and Development Standards Build to Zones and Setbacks No more than a 20% change in the maximum or minimum setback applicable or 5 feet whichever is greater. Changes to the Build to Zones and setbacks may only occur when they are caused by one or more of the following: 
 1. Need to accommodate existing buildings and structures on the lot that meet the overall intent and vision for redevelopment in the URDC area; or 
 2. Need to accommodate other required modes of transportation (transit, bike, pedestrian), stormwater drainage, water quality, or low impact development (LID) elements on the site; or 
 3. Need to accommodate overhead or underground utilities and/or easements; or 
 4. Need to preserve existing trees on the property. This adjustment is not mandatory for tree preservation, but for the allowance for preservation; or 
 5. Need to provide public amenities along the sidewalk (outdoor dining/seating, larger sidewalk, or other similar public amenities). Building Frontage No more than a 25% reduction in the required building frontage along each subject lot with Pedestrian-Friendly or General Frontage designation. Any reduction in the required building frontage shall be to address one or more of the following to accommodate: 
 1. Existing buildings and site elements; 
 2. Limited access to a side or rear parking area; or 
 3. Other required transit, bike and pedestrian, stormwater drainage, or water quality elements on the site. Building Heights Increase in height of building for providing a public amenity. Height may be increased by one additional story if an additional 5% of site area is dedicated as Public Open Space on-site beyond the minimum requirement. The public open space shall meet the standards of the Public Open Space Types in Attachment 2 of this Section. Public Open Space may be privately owned and maintained. Required Parking Spaces Reduction in the number of required parking spaces. Reduction in the number of parking spaces shall be based on one or more of the following: 
 1. A shared parking plan for parking within 1,000 feet of the subject property; or 
 2. A parking study for the uses proposed on the site; or 
 3. A combination of the above. Uptown Entertainment (U-ENT) Specific Allowances Block length Adjustment to desired block lengths by the development. An adjustment of block lengths within the U-ENT zone will be permitted provided an approved pedestrian connectivity network is provided within the block. Other Any other numerical standard in the Section An adjustment up to 10% (increase or decrease). An adjustment of a numerical standard is needed to accommodate existing conditions.

2.5 Noncomplying Structures and Sites 
A noncomplying structure or site may be altered or enlarged, provided that such alteration or enlargement shall neither create any new nonconformity, nor shall increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure or site. Attachment 1 shall provide examples of acceptable additions to noncomplying structures in the URDC area. Creation of non-conditioned spaces such as rooftop terraces, patios, and outdoor dining areas that increase the degree of nonconformity spatially shall be allowed even if they create a new nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity. 
2.6 Amendments to the URDC 
Amendments and changes to the URDC Zoning Plan, text and property boundaries beyond those expressly permitted under this Section shall be in accordance with the procedure set out in the City Code. 
3.0 Schedule of Permitted Uses 
3.1 Applicability 
Due to the emphasis on urban form over land uses in the URDC, general use categories have been identified by zone (Table 3-1: Schedule of Uses). 
a)  Use Determination: The Director of Community Development or his or her designee is responsible for categorizing all uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the Director of Community Development or his or her designee shall place the proposed use under that use category. A use not specifically listed shall be prohibited unless it is found to be similar to another listed use as described using the criteria below. The Director of Community Development or his or her designee's decision may be appealed to the PC for final determination. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the Director of Community Development or his or her designee may consider any other following relevant criteria, especially as it relates to any direct impacts on adjoining roadways and/or neighborhoods: 
i)  The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use; 
ii)  The relative number of employees; 
iii)  Hours of operation; 
iv)  Buildings and site arrangement; 
v)  The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use or uses; 
vi)  Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements; 
vii)  Relative amounts of sales; 
viii)  Transportation demand by all modes, including the number of vehicle, transit, and bike/walk trips generated and whether existing or proposed infrastructure is adequate to serve those trips; 
ix)  The likely impact on surrounding properties; or 
x)  Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site. 
3.2 Uses Permitted with Criteria 
Certain uses are permitted with criteria established in Table 3-2. These uses will only be permitted to documented adherence to the design criteria and by approval of the Director of Community Development or his or her designee.

4.0 Building Form and Development Standards 
Building form and development standards applicable to each URDC zone are described in this Subsection. The images and graphics through this Subsection are provided as illustrative of intent and are advisory only. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific standards. 
In addition, the graphics used to illustrate the standards in each URDC zone are NOT intended to indicate exact conditions within each URDC zone. Rather, illustrations are conceptual and standards are to be applied based on the specific frontage types designated along the subject property or site. Also, the illustrations may depict other site elements to establish context and only the standards regulated by the specific Subsection shall apply. 
Building form graphics in this Subsection are NOT TO SCALE. 
4.1 General to All URDC Zones 
a)  Building Frontage Designations: Building Frontage designations shall be indicated by the applicant as part of the Large-Scale Development Plan submittal, subject to the minimum standards of each URDC zone. New street frontages, as they are designed, shall be designated as one of the three classifications, with allocation review by the Director of Community Development or his or her designee. Building frontages are classified into one of the following three categories: 
i)  Pedestrian-Priority: 
1.  Pedestrian-Priority Frontages are intended to provide the most pedestrian-friendly and contiguous development context. Buildings and sites along Pedestrian-Priority Frontages shall be held to the highest standard of pedestrian-oriented design and few, if any, gaps shall be permitted in the "street wall." Breaks in the street wall may be permitted for courtyards, forecourts, sidewalk cafés, and pedestrian connections between the individual sites and the public sidewalk. These street frontages are the main retail, restaurant, entertainment streets or are important neighborhood connectors. 
2.  The area between the building façade and property line or edge of any existing sidewalk along any street with Pedestrian-Priority Frontage shall be designed such that the sidewalk width shall be the minimum of the designated street cross section and the remainder of any setback area shall be paved flush with the public sidewalk. Sidewalk cafés, public art, landscaping within tree-wells or planters may be incorporated within this area. 

Illustration showing requirements along Pedestrian-Priority Frontages 
ii)  Pedestrian-Friendly-Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages are also intended to be pedestrian-oriented with a mostly contiguous development context. However, in some locations, where access to a General Frontage street or Alley is not available, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may need to accommodate driveways, parking, service/utility functions, and loading and unloading. In such cases, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages may balance pedestrian orientation with automobile accommodation. Typically, they shall establish a hybrid development context that has a more pedestrian-supportive development context at street intersections and accommodates auto-related functions and surface parking in the middle of the block. Surface parking shall be screened from the roadway per Subsection 8.3 of this Section. 
iii)  General-General Frontages are intended to accommodate more auto-oriented uses, surface parking, and service functions on a site with a more suburban/automobile orientation. The General Frontages shall be any frontage not designated as either a Pedestrian-Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage. 

Illustration showing the application of Frontage Types and their related development context 
b)  Treatment of Street Intersections: 
i)  At the intersections of Pedestrian-Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages, corner building street façades shall be built within the Build-to-Zone (BTZ) for a minimum of 30 feet from the intersection, along each street, or the width of the lot, whichever is less. 
ii)  Corners of buildings are permitted to have curved or chamfered forms, recessed entries or public open space at these corners. 
iii)  In the case of public open space at the corner, the building shall wrap along the public open space. 

Illustration showing minimum frontage requirements at an intersection of Pedestrian-Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages 
iv)  Corner buildings may exceed the maximum building height by 25% along no more than 20% of the building frontage along each corresponding street façade.

iii)  Driveways, Alleys and Service Access: 
1.  Unless otherwise specified in the specific URDC zone standards in Subsections 4.2 through 4.5, driveways and off-street loading and unloading may be located with access along a Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage street only if the property has no access to either an alley, General Frontage street or joint use easement to an adjoining property with direct driveway access to any other street. 
2.  Unless otherwise specified in the specific URDC zone standards in Subsections 4.2 through 4.5, driveways and off-street loading and unloading may be located with access along a Pedestrian-Priority Frontage street only if the property has no access to either an alley, Pedestrian-Friendly or General Frontage Street or joint use easement to an adjoining property with direct access to any other Street. 
3.  Along Pedestrian-Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages, driveway spacing shall be limited to one driveway per each block face or per 200 feet of block face for blocks greater than 400 feet in length. 
4.  Shared driveways, joint use easements or joint access easements shall be required for adjoining properties when driveway and service access is off a Pedestrian-Priority Frontage or Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage. 
5.  Service and loading/unloading areas shall be screened per standards in Subsection 8.3. 
6.  Residential Driveways: 
a.  Garages for Residential Buildings shall be located on streets with General Frontage, Alleys or at the rear of residential buildings with pull-through garages where the garage door is set back behind the rear façade of the main structure. If front-loaded garages or carports are utilized on residential uses, the garages and carports shall be no greater than to fit two cars and set back at least 20 feet measured from the Building Façade Line of the primary structure. This restriction does not apply for J-swing garages. 
b.  Front-loaded garages on residential lots less than 50 feet wide shall not be allowed. Townhomes and courtyard apartments shall utilize garages with access from streets with General Frontage, Alleys, or joint use easement to an adjoining property with direct access to any other Street. 
d)  Measuring heights: 
i)  Chimneys, vents, elevator and stair enclosures, screened HVAC equipment, other mechanical enclosures, tanks, solar energy systems and similar elements are exempt from the height limit. 
ii)  Internal building height shall be measured from finished floor to the bottom of the structural members of the ceiling. 
iii)  Floor-to-floor heights shall not apply to parking structures or civic buildings. 
iv)  Permitted corner tower elements are exempt from the height limit, except to the extent of the permitted tower height as denoted in Subsection 4.1(b)iv of this Section. 
e)  Encroachments: 
i)  Encroachments into R-O-W: 
1.  Maximum of 50% of the depth of the sidewalk when there is no vertical support for the object (except blade signs which shall encroach no more than 6 feet from the building façade line). 
2.  Maximum of 100% of the depth of the sidewalk when using a gallery, arcade or colonnade system. 
3.  Minimum vertical clearance from the finished sidewalk shall be 8 feet.

5.1 Purpose and Intent 
The Building Design Standards for the URDC establish a coherent urban character to encourage an enduring and attractive regional center. 
The key design principles establish essential goals for development within the URDC area to be consistent with the vision for Uptown Rogers to become a vibrant, walkable regional center that serves a range of commercial, civic, entertainment and residential uses that benefit the neighborhood and the region. Buildings shall be located and designed so that they provide visual interest and create enjoyable, human-scale spaces. The key design principles are: 
a)  New and redeveloped buildings and sites shall utilize building and site elements and details to achieve a pedestrian-oriented public realm with appropriate glazing, shading and shelter; 
b)  Design compatibility is not meant to be achieved through uniformity, but through the use of variations in building elements to achieve individual building identity; 
c)  Strengthen and celebrate the experience in Rogers; 
d)  Building façades shall include appropriate architectural details and ornament to create variety and interest; 
e)  Open space(s) shall be incorporated to provide usable public areas integral to the urban environment; and 
f)  Increase the quality, variety, adaptability, and sustainability in Rogers' building stock. 
5.2 Building Orientation and Entrances 
a)  Buildings shall be oriented towards Pedestrian-Priority Frontages, where the lot has frontage along Pedestrian-Priority Frontages. If a building has no frontage along a Pedestrian-Priority Frontage, then it should front a Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage. All other buildings may be oriented towards General Streets or Public Open Spaces. 
b)  Primary entrances to buildings shall be located on the street along which the building is oriented (see figure below). At intersections, corner buildings may have their primary entrances oriented at an angle to the intersection. Building entrances shall be provided for all separate ground floor commercial use tenant spaces that are located along Pedestrian-Priority or Pedestrian-Friendly Frontage. 

Figure showing required building orientation and location of primary entrances 
c)  All primary entrances shall be oriented to the public sidewalk for ease of pedestrian access. Secondary and service entrances may be located from parking areas or alleys. 
d)  Primary Entrance Design: Primary building entrances along Pedestrian-Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages shall consist of at least two of the following design elements so that the main entrance is architecturally prominent and clearly visible from that street, see figures below: 
i)  Architectural details such as arches, friezes, awnings, canopies, arcades, tile work, murals, or moldings; or 
ii)  Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscape or seating elements; or 
iii)  Prominent three-dimensional, vertical features, such as belfries, chimneys, clock towers, domes, spires, steeples, towers, or turrets; or 
iv)  A repeating pattern of pilasters projecting from the façade wall by a minimum of eight inches or architectural or decorative columns. 

Images showing appropriate transparency required along Pedestrian-Priority and Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages 
5.3 Façade Composition 
a)  Commercial, Mixed Use and Multi-Family Use Buildings: 
i)  Façades greater than 60 feet in length along all Pedestrian-Priority Frontage, Pedestrian-Friendly Frontages and Public Open Spaces shall meet the following façade articulation standards: 
1.  Include façade modules so that a portion of the façade steps back or extends forward with a depth of at least 24 inches, unless an alternative use of change in materials, such as utilization of transparent, dominant, and functional storefront windows or glass block walls, accomplishes a similarly differentiated architectural outcome (see figure below). 
2.  The distance from the inside edge of a building projection to the nearest inside edge of an adjacent projection shall not be less than 20 feet and not greater than 60 feet (see figure below).

(Ord. No. 16-05, § 1(Exh. A), 1-12-2016; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016; Ord. No. 17-31, § 2(Exh. B), 5-9-2017) 
Sec. 14-737. - Density Management. 
(a)  Purpose and Intent. These provisions are intended to provide a means for objective analysis of residential density in the City of Rogers. It is important for the City to responsibly facilitate growth by encouraging density where appropriate and restricting density where inappropriate. The City's Comprehensive Growth Map (CGM) provides the basis for the highest and best use of land and designates select areas for higher intensity development. The CGM sets density ranges and organizes them by Growth Designation in an effort to accommodate both administrative and discretionary approval processes for residential development proposals. Growth Designations are broad land use categories organized by purpose, character, and level of development intensity, with various zoning districts allowed within each designation. 
(b)  Density Concept Plan. A Density Concept Plan (DCP) is the mechanism used to assess the impact of exceeding the base density of a given Growth Designation per the City's CGM. Impact is assessed by two primary considerations: the compatibility of a proposed density in terms of land use and building form, and the capacity of the transportation network to support the proposed density. 
(1)  Applicability. A DCP is required when a development proposal involves a gross residential density above the base limit of the subject Growth Designation per the City's CGM. 
(A)  Calculating Density. Gross density shall be calculated as the ratio of dwelling units to total site area including public rights-of-way, common open space, and non-buildable land. Net density shall be calculated as the ratio of dwelling units to residential area excluding public rights-of-way, common open space, and non-buildable land. In the Neighborhood Center Growth Designation, the land area used for gross density calculation shall include the entirety of the Neighborhood Center. 
(B)  Association with Rezone. In order to ensure compliance with all conditions of acceptance, a rezone ordinance is the means by which a DCP becomes enforceable and assigned to a specific land area. An accepted DCP shall be filed with and attached to the subject rezone ordinance that reflects the density established in the DCP. 
(C)  Existing Zoning Designations. In cases where a residential zoning designation is already in place, but the property has not developed, a DCP is required to accompany a development proposal that exceeds the base density of its Growth Designation subject to all procedural requirements of this Section. 
(D)  Modifications. If a development proposal seeks to deviate from an accepted DCP, and the deviations are minor in that they are warranted due to site-specific constraints and do not substantially alter the overall density, layout, or design, the modification may be approved by staff. If the deviations are significant in that they are not warranted by site-specific constraints or substantially alter the overall density, layout, or design, the modification shall be required to obtain acceptance of a new DCP subject to all procedural requirements of this Section. 
(2)  Submittal and Review Procedure. A DCP submittal shall be made subject to the following requirements: 
(A)  Provide proof of a pre-submittal conference with staff. 
(B)  Submit a complete DCP application with any relevant supplemental materials including but not limited to site plans, elevation drawings, schematic drawings, written narratives, reports, or other materials requested by staff. All submittals shall, at a minimum, provide the following information: 
(i)  Site area; 
(ii)  Building setbacks; 
(iii)  Building height; 
(iv)  Building elevations; 
(v)  Building materials breakdown; 
(vi)  Lot coverage and open space calculations; 
(vii)  Impervious area calculations; 
(viii)  Physical constraints, easements, or other encumbrances; 
(ix)  Current and proposed zoning; 
(x)  Dwelling unit counts; and 
(xi)  Gross and net density calculations. 
(C)  Once a complete DCP application has been submitted it will be placed on the agenda for the next available Plans and Policy Committee meeting. Staff will conduct a technical analysis of the DCP in advance of said meeting and provide recommendations to the committee. The Plans and Policy Committee may take the following actions on the proposed DCP: 
(i)  Recommend for acceptance by the Planning Commission as presented; 
(ii)  Recommend for acceptance by the Planning Commission with conditions; or 
(iii)  Deny as presented or table for further consideration. 
(D)  If recommended for acceptance, the applicant may submit a rezone application per Section 14-727 to accompany Planning Commission action on the DCP. The rezone public hearing is the means by which the rezone and DCP are considered. The Planning Commission may take the following actions on the proposed DCP and rezone request: 
(i)  Accept DCP as presented and recommend rezone and/or DCP for City Council approval; 
(ii)  Accept DCP with conditions and recommend rezone and/or DCP for City Council approval; or 
(iii)  Deny DCP as presented or table for further consideration. 
(E)  Once accepted by Planning Commission, the DCP is considered approved upon the City Council's passage of the proposed rezone ordinance per Section 14-727. If the rezone request is approved by the City Council, the accepted DCP shall be attached to the rezone ordinance, establishing permanent rules specific to the new zoning district until amended or replaced. 
(3)  Review Criteria. The appropriateness of a proposed density shall be considered with regard to the following considerations: 
(A)  Compliance with the City's schedule of uses; 
(B)  Consistency with the purpose, character, and goals of the subject Growth Designation per the City's CGM. Growth Designation character is evaluated by the following: 
(i)  Building form, i.e., scale, massing, placement, roof pitch, height, frontage type, and similar considerations; 
(ii)  Architectural design, i.e., style, colors, materials, window shape, façade articulation, and similar considerations; and 
(iii)  Site layout, i.e., access, open space, building disposition, landscape, sightlines, street design, and similar considerations. 
(C)  Capacity of the surrounding transportation network to adequately support an increase above base density. Capacity is generally assumed to be adequate in most situations if land use is in compliance with the CGM and all other official plans, policies, and standards. Nonetheless, it remains beneficial to consider additional factors on an as-needed basis determined by the context of a given development proposal, including but not limited to the following: 
(i)  Trip generation estimates per ITE Trip Generation Manual (current edition); 
(ii)  A current traffic study including average daily traffic (ADT) and peak hour volume data of impacted roadways; 
(iii)  Roadway safety characteristics, pavement condition, and impact of existing and proposed nearby development; 
(iv)  Traffic management characteristics such as internal circulation routes, access points, calming methods, and parking management techniques; and 
(v)  Travel demand factors such as on-site amenities and mixed-use, proximity to essential goods and services, and the integration of non-vehicular infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 19-16, § 1(Exh. A), 2-26-2019) 
Sec. 14-738. - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU). 
(a)  Applicability. This section creates provisions for the existence of accessory dwelling units within the City of Rogers. This section does not apply to tiny houses or manufactured housing units as regulated elsewhere in this code. 
(b)  Purpose and Intent. This section provides standards to create new housing units while respecting the look and scale of single-dwelling development, subject to the regulations found herein. It is not the intent of this section to override lawful use restrictions as set forth in conditions, covenants, and restrictions of any existing subdivision or lot. 
(c)  Definition. An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a smaller, secondary home on the same lot as a primary dwelling. ADUs are independently habitable and provide the basic requirements of shelter, heating, cooking and sanitation. There are two types of ADUs: 
(1)  Detached. The unit is separated from the primary structure. 
(2)  Attached. The unit is attached to the primary structure. 
(d)  Permit and Approval. An ADU that meets the location and development standards contained in this Code shall be approved at staff level. ADUs will require building permits prior to construction. 
(e)  Location and Number Permitted. One ADU is allowed per lot and may be added to or in addition to a house on any residentially zoned lot. 
(f)  Maximum Occupancy of the Accessory Dwelling Unit. A maximum of two (2) persons shall be permitted to reside in an accessory dwelling unit. 
(g)  Development Standards. ADUs may be allowed subject to the following regulations. 
(1)  Must comply with the development standards of the underlying zone, including but not limited to lot size, setbacks, and building coverage, with the exception of height and density limits. 
(A)  Height . The maximum height for a detached ADU is 20 feet in height to the roof peak or the height of the primary structure, whichever is less. 
(B)  Density. ADUs are exempt from the residential density standards of this code. 
(2)  ADUs shall not exceed 50% of the habitable space of the primary dwelling or 1,200 square feet, whichever is greater. 
(3)  No additional parking is required for an ADU. Existing required parking for the primary dwelling must be maintained or replaced on-site. 
(4)  All ADUs must be on permanent foundation. 
(h)  Form Standards. The architectural design of an ADU shall be compatible with the design of the primary dwelling unit in terms of building size and height, construction materials, color, windows, doors, trims, roofing materials, and roof pitch. ADU design should consider the context of the surrounding neighborhood in addition to that of the primary dwelling unit. 
(i)  Variances. An applicant may request approval from the Board of Adjustment per Section 14-724 for a variance from the aforementioned development or form standards, where site-specific hardship can be demonstrated.

These problems are a concern because of their negative effects on the safety and general welfare of the community. 
(b)  Purpose. The purposes of this article are to: 
(1)  Prohibit the indiscriminate clearing of property. 
(2)  Prevent excessive grading, clearing, filling, cutting, or similar activities. 
(3)  Substantially reduce flooding, erosion and sediment damage within the City. 
(4)  To safeguard the safety and welfare of citizens. 
(5)  Establish reasonable standards and procedures for development, which prevent potential flooding, erosion and sediment damage. 
(6)  Prevent the pollution of streams, ponds and other watercourses by sediment. 
(7)  Minimize the danger of flood loss and property loss due to unstable slopes. 
(8)  Preserve natural vegetation, which enhances the quality of life of the community. 
(9)  Preserve the maximum number of trees that are determined to be appropriate for preservation in the City urban environment that have a reasonable chance of long term survival. 
(10)  Lessen the impact of tree removal by requiring that trees are replaced at an appropriate and sustainable level. 
(11)  Provide a visual buffer and screen against traffic and some buffer against noise pollution. 
(12)  Provide protections against severe weather. 
(13)  Provide a haven for birds, which in turn assist in the control of insects. 
(14)  Conserve and enhance the City's physical and aesthetic environment. 
(15)  Conceal hillside scars. 
(16)  Generally protect and enhance the quality of life and the general welfare of the City. 
(c)  General requirements. Persons engaged in land alteration activities regulated by this article shall take measures to protect neighboring public and private properties from damage by such activities. The requirements of this division, however, are not intended to prevent the reasonable use of properties. 
(1)  The responsible party shall be liable for all fines levied or remedial action required under this article. Each qualifying tree illegally removed or improperly preserved or any other activity proscribed by this division shall be a separate violation. In addition to any other criminal penalties that may be prescribed by state law, any violation of this section shall be subject to the penalty provisions as outlined in Rogers City Code Section 1-5. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense. 
(2)  Any person who engages in land alteration activities regulated by this article without obtaining a grading permit shall be required to restore the land, to the maximum extent practicable to its original condition. 
(3)  The permit applicant shall have on the project site at all times an agent who is a competent superintendent capable of reading and thoroughly understanding the plans, specifications and requirements for areas of tree protection for the type of work being performed. The superintendent shall have full authority to issue orders or direction to employees working on site, without delay and to promptly supply such materials, labor, equipment, tools, and incidentals as may be required to complete the work in a proper manner. If no superintendent is on site, the City official may issue the notice of violation and stop work order to the person conducting the violation. 
(4)  Removal of more than seven significant trees, that have been removed without a grading permit or trees required in an approved plan that have been removed or which die within 12 months, shall be considered a violation. 
(d)  Grading permit required. 
(1)  Any person proposing to engage in clearing, filling, cutting, quarrying, construction, or similar activities that would result in a disturbed area of one acre or larger shall apply to the Department of Community Development for a grading permit as specified in this article. A large-scale development plan shall be obtained from the City before constructing or expanding a vehicular use area or when expanding or rehabilitating a building and landscaping is required. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 14, article VI, the responsible party shall not be allowed the removal of more than seven trees within any given 12-month period without first obtaining a grading permit. The City official may exempt the need for the permit on a limited case-by-case basis. No land shall be altered or cleared to the extent regulated in this article unless approved by a permit. 
(2)  a.  If more than seven significant trees are to be removed by the owner/developer they must submit a tree protection or replacement plan to the office of transportation and planning. This plan must show all significant trees on site. The plan shall show all roads, utilities, building footprints, driveways, and areas to be disturbed. If significant trees are in the disturbed area they are to be replaced at a rate of one to five (one tree to be planted for every five trees removed). If the drip line of the significant tree is adjacent to a construction area measures must be made to protect the tree with fencing and other protective measures. If a significant tree is removed from a nonconstruction area it must be replaced at a replacement rate of five-to-one. 
b.  Replacement trees shall be replanted with trees that meet the following specifications: 
1.  Deciduous: At least two and a half inches in diameter and at least six feet in height above natural grade; 
2.  Evergreen: At least eight feet in height above natural grade; and 
3.  Ornamental: At least two inches in diameter and at least six feet in height above natural grade. 
c.  1.  A tree is significant, if it is a tree and it is: 
i.  At least eight inches in diameter at the height of four and a half feet above natural grade; 
ii.  Growing with multiple stems and at least one of the stems measured at a point six inches from the point where the stems digress from the main trunk is at least six inches in diameter; 
iii.  An ornamental tree with a diameter in excess of two inches in diameter at the height six inches above natural grade; or 
iv.  Planted and meets the requirements of subdivision (d)(2)b. of this section and subsection (14) of section 14-256. 
2.  A tree is not significant if it is less than eight (8) inches in diameter at four and a half feet above natural grade or those included on the following list, regardless of size: 
i.  Black locust (Robinia pseqdoacacia); 
ii.  Cottonwood (Populous trichocarps); 
iii.  Red cedar (Juniperus virginiana); and 
iv.  Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana "Bradford"). 
(3)  No land alteration shall be permitted until all necessary City approval of all plans and permits, except building permit, have been issued and construction is imminent. Clearing and grading for streets and drainage improvements may be done on residential subdivisions provided the preliminary plat has been approved. In those cases where filling or cutting in areas with no trees is to be done, the area is to be graded suitable for mowing and shall be revegetated. If building construction has not commenced and been diligently pursued within eight months of plans approval, then all landscaping and tree requirements in the buffers shall be installed, unless the City official determines that the existing buffers on the site meet the landscape planting requirements of this article and chapter 14. 
(4)  A grading permit is required for land alteration activities specified in this section. However, all construction work shall include appropriate drainage and erosion control measures to protect neighboring properties. All land alteration in properties within the designated floodplain requires a grading permit without exception. 
(5)  Prior to the issuance of a grading permit, a grading and drainage plan shall be submitted and approved by the City. 
(6)  Utility organizations may obtain a one-time approval from the City for all routine tree trimming and installation, maintenance, replacement and repair of fence and sign posts, telephone poles and other kinds of posts or poles and overhead or underground electric, water, sewer, natural gas, telephone or cable facilities. The approval will include a utility organization and its contractors, agents or assigns and will be permanent in nature as long as the original approved procedures are followed. However, large-scale utility projects involving clearing of areas over 25 feet in width shall not be authorized by one-time approval of all projects. In such cases, a separate grading permit must be obtained for each project. 
(7)  One-time approval may be obtained by public or private entities for the stockpiling of construction spoil material at particular locations for a limited time period, not to exceed six months. Grading and replanting of grassed areas is required upon removal of stockpile. 
(e)  Exemptions. A grading permit shall not be required for emergency work or repairs to protect health, safety and welfare of the public. Removal of damaged or diseased trees will be permitted by City staff upon certification by proper authority. As used in this subsection, "diseased tree" means any tree with a structural defect or a health condition, which makes it subject to a high probability of failure. 
(f)  Contents of grading and drainage plans. The grading and drainage plan shall identify the following: 
(1)  Acreage of the proposed project; 
(2)  Land areas to be disturbed; 
(3)  Stages of grading showing the limits of sections to be graded and indicating the approximate order of development; 
(4)  Location and size of existing significant trees; 
(5)  The height and slope of cuts and fills. Cross sections shall be required every 100 feet on property where the depth of excavation or fills exceeds five feet, showing original and final grades and will include visual aids to show how the final development, including planting and landscaping will look. A grading plan showing existing and proposed contours with a maximum two-foot contour interval for slopes less than ten percent and a maximum five-foot contour interval for slopes greater than ten percent can be shown as an alternate to cross sections every 50 feet; 
(6)  Provisions for collecting and discharging surface water; 
(7)  Erosion and sediment measures, including structural and vegetative measures; 
(8)  Seal, certificate of authority and signature of a licensed engineer qualified under state regulations to certify that the grading and drainage plan complies with this article;

(10)  Location of all known existing sewers, water mains, culverts, and underground utilities within the tract and immediately adjacent thereto; location of existing permanent buildings on or immediately adjacent to the site if right of entry can be obtained to locate same; 
(11)  Identification of rights-of-way or easements affecting the property; 
(12)  A plan of the site at a minimum scale of one inch equals 100 feet or less, i.e., 1 inch = 50 feet or 1 inch = 30 feet, etc.; 
(13)  Such other information required by City officials including, but not limited to: 
a.  Address and telephone number of owner, permit applicant and the designated agent responsible for maintenance of erosion and sediment control measures; 
b.  The approximate location and width of existing and proposed streets; 
c.  The locations and dimensions of all proposed or existing lots; 
d.  The locations and dimensions of all parcels of land proposed to be set aside for parks, playgrounds, natural condition perimeters, public use, or for the use of property owners in proposed development;

f.  An approximate timing schedule, indicating the anticipated starting and completion dates of the development: a timing schedule for the sequence of grading and application of erosion and sediment control measures; 
g.  Acreage of the proposed project; 
h.  Identification of unusual material or soils in land areas to be disturbed. If any surface indications of unusual materials or soils that would cause street or lot instability, such as nonvertical tree growth, old slides, seepage, or depressions in the soil are visible before grading, they should be noted and accompanied by the engineer's recommendation for correcting such problem areas; 
i.  Identification of suitable material to be used for fills shall be accomplished before actual filling begins. If there are any surface indications that local material is not suitable for fills, those areas to be filled with outside material should be identified and the type and source of the fill noted; 
j.  Specification of measures to control runoff, erosion, and sedimentation during the process of construction, noting those areas where control of runoff will be required during construction and indicating what will be used, such as straw bales, sediment basins, silt dams, brush check dams, lateral hillside ditches, catchbasins, etc.; 
k.  Measures to protect neighboring built-up areas and City property during process of construction, noting work to be performed, such as cleaning existing ditches, storm culverts and catchbasins or raising existing curbs in neighboring areas; 
l.  Provisions to stabilize soils and slopes after completion of streets, sewers and other improvements, noting on the grading plan when and where ground cover will be planted, also noting any other means to be used such as placement of stone embankments and riprap or construction of retaining walls; 
m.  All fill areas shall be compacted to 95 percent standard proctor density unless approved in writing by the Department of Community Development. 
(g)  Issuance procedure. 
(1)  The following procedure shall be implemented for the issuance of a grading permit: 
a.  The Department of Community Development shall approve, disapprove, or recommend modification of the grading and drainage plan in writing within ten days after the date of submittal unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. 
b.  Applications for which Planning Commission approval is required as determined by the Director of the Department of Community Development or his or her designee shall be placed on the next available Planning Commission agenda following City staff review. Engineered grading and drainage plans shall be reviewed by the City and a report prepared by the time of the applicable subdivision subcommittee meeting, if possible, but not later than the applicable Planning Commission meeting. 
c.  Upon approval of the final plan, the City shall issue a grading permit. A superintendent capable of understanding the plans and with the authority to issue orders to employees performing the land alteration shall properly supervise the land alteration work. 
(2)  Groups of trees and individual trees that are not to be removed and required undisturbed buffer areas shall be protected during construction by protective fencing and shall not be used for material storage or for any other purpose. Tree protection barriers shall be a minimum of four feet high, constructed of chain-link, or polyethylene laminar safety fencing or similar material, subject to approval by the Department of Community Development. "Tree Protection Area" signs shall be posted visibly on all sides of the fenced areas. On large or multiple-project sites, the Department of Community Development may also require that signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards be posted at site entrances. The tree protection barrier must be placed at the outside edge of the drip line of the existing trees. 
(3)  The City official may allow minor modifications of the plan to alleviate particular problems during the process of construction. In reviewing request for modifications, the City official may require from the applicant's engineer appropriate reports and data sufficient to make a decision on the request. 
(4)  Major changes to plans approved by the Planning Commission shall only be permitted by the Planning Commission. Examples of major changes are those that substantially increase the height of cuts, the area of clearing or grading, or impact on neighboring properties. More than 20 percent increase in height, area or impact will normally be considered a major change. Examples of increased impact include reductions in buffer area, increased runoff onto adjacent properties and increased site area that is visible from adjacent properties or public streets. 
(h)  Grading and drainage plan requirements. Preparation of grading and drainage plans shall follow the stormwater management and drainage manual and shall be designed on the basis of the following considerations: 
(1)  A maximum of 30 vertical feet of fill or excavation (three, ten-foot vertical terraces or two, 15-foot vertical terraces) is permitted; however, additional development areas may be constructed a minimum of 150 feet in width and at a slope of no more than eight percent. The maximum of 30 feet of fill or excavation may again be utilized. 
a.  The depth of fill or excavation shall be measured from the finish grade elevation to the original ground line elevation. 
b.  No more than 200 feet of terrace can be in a straight line and a minimum of a ten-foot curved section, job or offset is required for each additional 200 feet of terrace. 
c.  For excavations or fills constructed with slopes flatter than 3:1 (three horizontal to one vertical), terraces are not required nor is there a limit on the height of cut of fill. Planting requirements on these 3:1 slopes shall be the same as required for terraces and shall be spaced uniformly over the slope. 
d.  Cuts or fills shall be limited to ten feet in height or to 15 feet if architectural stone is included to protect the vertical face. A series of smaller cuts or fills with terraces, preserving portions of natural vegetation and providing areas for planting, shall be used in situations where more than ten feet of cut or fill is needed. 
e.  Terracing width shall be at a ratio of at least one foot of horizontal terrace for every one foot of vertical height, up to a maximum of ten feet. Terraces shall be landscaped with dense evergreen plantings sufficient to screen the cut or fill slope. 
f.  If the slope of the cut or fill is faced with an architectural stone wall, the terrace plantings shall be a minimum of two rows of trees four feet between the rows, staggered not more than 20 feet on centers. 
g.  Shrubs and ground cover shall be required. 
(2)  Development shall be planned to fit topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and other existing site conditions. 
(3)  Provisions shall be made for safety against unstable slopes or slopes subject to erosion and deterioration. 
(4)  Grading shall complement natural landforms. 
(5)  Significant trees should only be removed if in the immediate area of construction. 
(6)  After grading, all paving, seeding, sodding, or mulching shall be performed in accordance with a reasonable schedule approved by the City official. 
(7)  Open areas not planned for immediate use shall be seeded or sodded. Soil which is exposed for more than 21 days with no construction activity shall be seeded, mulched or revegetated in accordance with this Code. 
(8)  Areas not well suited to development, as evidenced by existing incompetent soils, geology, and hydrology investigations and reports, should be allocated to open space and recreational uses. 
(i)  Soil loss. The potential for soil loss shall be minimized by retaining natural vegetation wherever possible. 
(1)  Appropriate provisions such as those in the stormwater management and drainage manual shall be used to accommodate stormwater runoff and control soil loss occasioned by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development, including the use of vegetation and limitations on soil exposure. If staff determines upon visual inspection that excessive silt from the construction has migrated offsite, additional measures to reduce erosion may be required. 
(2)  Permanent improvements such as streets, storm sewers, curb and gutters, and other features for control of storm runoff shall be scheduled as soon as economically and physically feasible before removing vegetation cover from the area, so that large areas are not left bare and exposed for long periods of time beyond the capacity of temporary control measures. 
(3)  A temporary or permanent sediment basin, debris basin, desilting basin or silt trap shall be installed and maintained to substantially reduce sediment from water runoff. The volume of the sediment basin shall be 3,000 cubic feet per acre for property with average slope greater than five percent, or 1,500 cubic feet per acre for property with an average slope less than five percent. A properly sized sediment basin is required for each separate drainage area within the property being developed. 
(4)  Construction access shall be limited to locations as approved by the City official. Construction access points shall be graveled for a minimum length of 20 percent of the lot depth or 50 feet, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of 100 feet and of adequate thickness to minimize tracking onto the City street. 
(5)  Appropriate provisions shall be made to prevent excessive particulate matter from becoming airborne. 
(6)  A perimeter buffer strip shall be temporarily maintained around disturbed areas for erosion control purposes and shall be kept undisturbed except for reasonable access for maintenance. The width of the strip shall be six percent of the lot width and depth. The minimum width shall be 25 feet and the maximum shall be 40 feet. In no event shall these temporary strips be less than the width of the permanent buffers required for the development. 
(7)  A minimum strip 25 feet wide, undisturbed except for reasonable access, shall be provided along each side of streams having a peak ten-year storm flow rate of greater than 150 cubic feet per second. The 25-foot strip shall be measured from the top of the bank. An exception to this requirement is allowed where the only work being done on the site is public street construction. 
(8)  Care shall be exercised to minimize the risk of damage from or to pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the vicinity of a cut or fill by placement of handrails, guardrails, fencing or landscaping. 
(j)  Unified plan and permit. One plan may be submitted incorporating all provisions for compliance with the applicable City zoning, landscaping, drainage detention, grading, clearing, filling, cutting, quarrying, and construction requirements. 
(k)  Grading plans. Grading plans shall conform to the Phase II Stormwater Regulations as established by United States Environmental Protection Agency's regulations, Region VI published in the July 6, 1998, Federal Register or its latest revisions. 
(l)  Copy required. A copy of the ADEQ NOI permit shall be required for all sites of one acre or more. 
(m)  Transition period. Any construction or development project which has received a grading permit under prior provisions of this Code shall come into full compliance with the requirements of this division within 30 days of its effective date. 
(n)  Fees. A fee for each grading permit shall be paid to the City as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the City Council from time to time.

DIVISION 4. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 14-811. - Enforcement personnel authorized. 
    The following personnel employed by the city/county shall have the power to issue notices of violations and implement other enforcement actions under this division as provided by the City: 
(1)  All authorized personnel under the supervision of the Department of Community Development; 
(2)  All inspectors and code enforcement officers under the supervision of the director of code enforcement; and 
(3)  All county health officers that are authorized representatives of the director of the county health department. 
(Code 1997, § 130-121; Ord. No. 08-33, § 4(A), 3-11-2008; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-812. - Right of entry and sampling. 
(a)  Whenever the stormwater coordinator has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this article, the stormwater coordinator shall have the right to enter the premises at any reasonable time to determine if the discharger is complying with all requirements of this article. In the event that the owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter has been made, the City is hereby empowered to seek assistance from a court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. 
(b)  The Department of Community Development shall have the right to set up on the property of any discharger to the storm drainage system such devices that are necessary to conduct sampling of discharges. 
(Code 1997, § 130-122; Ord. No. 08-33, § 4(B), 3-11-2008; Ord. No. 16-103, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-2016) 
Sec. 14-813. - Enforcement procedures. 
    This policy establishes a formal enforcement procedure to be followed by the City stormwater coordinator when enforcement action is necessary on sites that do not comply with the City's stormwater pollution prevention, erosion control, and grading and tree preservation ordinance. Enforcement cases can be generated in any of three ways: through the construction review process; through complaints from individuals, groups, etc.; and through referrals from city/state agencies. Procedures to be followed for each of these methods are outlined in this section. 
(1)  Construction review. Every effort is made to use the construction review process to correct deficiencies in site compliance whenever possible. Should that process fail to achieve expected results or if the site reviewer feels that a violation is serious enough to warrant enforcement action, the following procedures shall be followed: 
a.  Issuance of notice of violation. If site deficiencies are noted, the owner/developer or authorized agent shall be given a notice of violation. The notice of violation shall be specific as to the noted violation, corrective measures to be taken, and time frame allowed to complete the work. 
b.  Compliance review. At the end of the time period specified in subsection (1)a. of this section, a follow-up site inspection shall take place to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Depending on that determination, the following actions may occur: 
1.  Site violations corrected. If all previous site violations have been corrected, the site reviewer shall issue an inspection report stating that fact and the site shall be returned to a normal construction review status. 
2.  Previous violations not corrected. If previously noted violations have not been satisfactorily corrected, the further actions may be initiated as outlined in the following section. 
(2)  Submissions from the general public. Members of the general public may submit information pertaining to this article to the Department of Community Development. The stormwater coordinator will consider such submissions as they pertain to the implementation and enforcement of this article and will provide written or verbal response to the person submitting the information. 
(3)  Referrals from other agencies. Referrals from other agencies will be handled in the following manner: 
a.  Cases will be referred directly to the stormwater coordinator. At this point the stormwater coordinator will determine if enforcement actions are warranted and if proper documentation has been obtained. If the stormwater coordinator determines that action is required, the enforcement process will be set into motion. 
b.  Cases received by the stormwater coordinator will be handled on a first come, first served basis. All enforcement actions will be initiated by a site inspection to verify site conditions that caused the case to be referred. If conditions have been corrected or do not exist as stated in the referral, the case will be returned to file for documentation and reporting purposes. If conditions exist as stated in the referral, enforcement actions will proceed. 
c.  Once site conditions have been verified and the site is determined to be in a state of noncompliance two avenues of enforcement can be pursued, one for the infrequent offender and one for the frequent offender. 
1.  Infrequent offender, if an individual or company is being reviewed by the stormwater coordinator for the first time or it has been at least three years since the last violation (36 months has elapsed since last review), a notice to comply will be issued to the owner/developer informing them they are not in compliance with the City's stormwater pollution prevention, erosion control, and grading and tree preservation ordinance, the steps needed to be taken to get into compliance, and that they have an established time frame to complete the work. At the end of the period the stormwater coordinator will reinspect to check for compliance. If all work has been satisfactorily completed the case will be returned to file for documentation and reporting purposes. If the work has not been satisfactorily completed within the established time frame a citation (ticket) will be issued to the owner/developer and follow-up will be done until the site is brought into compliance. 
2.  Frequent offender, if an individual or company has been reviewed by the stormwater coordinator at any time in the preceding 36 months they will be considered repeat offenders. Repeat offenders will be issued a citation (ticket) by the stormwater coordinator upon verification of noncompliance with the City's stormwater pollution prevention, erosion control, and grading and tree preservation ordinance and after consulting with the Department of Community Development. Follow up will continue until the site has been brought into compliance. 
(4)  Enforcement options for failure to comply. 
a.  The City stormwater coordinator in conjunction with the Department of Community Development may issue a stop work order to any persons violating any provision of the City's stormwater pollution prevention, erosion control, and grading and tree preservation ordinance by ordering that all site work stop except that necessary to comply with any administrative order. 
b.  The City stormwater coordinator may request that the Department of Community Development or building inspections office refrain from issuing any further building or grading permits until outstanding violations have been remedied. 
c.  The city stormwater coordinator may initiate penalties as stipulated herein. Complete information concerning enforcement and penalties is described below. 
(5)  Action without prior notice. Any person who violates a prohibition or fails to meet a requirement of this article will be subject, without prior notice, to one or more of the enforcement actions, when attempts to contact the person have failed and the enforcement actions are necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm drainage system. 
(6)  Enforcement actions. 
a.  Recovery of costs. Within 30 days after abatement by City representatives, the Department of Community Development shall notify the property owner of the costs of abatement, including administrative costs, and the deadline for payment. The property owner may protest the assessment before the City Council. The written protest must be received by the Mayor's office within 15 days of the date of the notification. A hearing on the matter will be scheduled before the City Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final. If the amount due is not paid within the protest period or within ten days of the decision of the City Council, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. A copy of the resolution shall be turned over to the county clerk so that the clerk may enter the amounts of the assessment against the parcel as it appears on the current assessment roll, and the treasurer shall include the amount of the assessment on the bill for taxes levied against the parcel of land. 
b.  Termination of utility services. If the Department of Community Development determines that the disconnection of utility services will remedy or mitigate a violation of this article that poses a public health hazard or environmental hazard, they shall notify Rogers Water Utilities and request the disconnection of city water, sanitary sewer, and/or sanitation services. 
c.  Performance bonds. Where necessary for the reasonable implementation of this article, the Department of Community Development may, by written notice, order any owner of a construction site or subdivision development to file a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Department of Community Development to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance with this article. The City may deny approval of any building permit, subdivision plat, site development plan, or any other city permit or approval necessary to commence or continue construction or to assume occupancy, until such a performance bond has been filed. The owner may protest the amount of the performance bond before the City Council. The written protest must be received by the Mayor's office within 15 days of the date of the notification. A hearing on the matter will be scheduled before the City Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final. 
d.  Criminal prosecution. Any person who violates or continues to violate a prohibition or requirement of this article shall be subject to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to criminal penalties. 
(7)  Criminal penalties. Non-compliance with any provision of this article shall be deemed a violation. Any person violating this article shall, upon an adjudication of guilt or a plea of no contest, be fined according to the schedule of fines. Each separate day on which a violation is committed or continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(8)  Other legal action. Notwithstanding any other remedies or procedures available to the City, if any person discharges into the storm drainage system in a manner that is contrary to the provisions of this article, the senior staff attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and equitable relief including damages and costs in any court of competent jurisdiction. The senior staff attorney may seek a preliminary or permanent injunction or both which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the discharger. 
(9)  a.  Violations/schedule of fines. The improper or illegal removal of each individual tree referred to in this section by anyone shall constitute a separate violation of this article. The penalty for violation of this article shall be a fine of not to exceed $1,000.00 per tree. 
b.  As used in this section, "removal" includes: 
1.  The actual removal of a tree; and 
2.  Causing the effective removal of a tree by damaging, poisoning, or other direct or indirect actions likely to result in the death of a tree.

Sec. 14-831. - Introduction. 
(a)  Effects of urbanization. Urban development alters the hydrology of watersheds and streams by disrupting the natural water cycle. Impacts include: 
(1)  Runoff volumes increase up to 50 percent over predeveloped volumes; 
(2)  Peak runoff discharges increase two to five times predeveloped discharges; 
(3)  Runoff velocities increase; 
(4)  Time of concentrations decrease; 
(5)  Frequency of bankfull and near bankfull events increase; 
(6)  Flooding increases; and 
(7)  Dry weather flows (baseflow) decrease. 
    These changes in the hydrology of the area translate into the changes shown in the typical hydrograph presented in Figure 1.

(b)  Sources of pollutants. Urbanization increases the amount of sediment, nutrients, microbes, organic matter, toxic pollutants, and trash in stormwater flows. 
(1)  Sediment in water (suspended solids, dissolved solids, and/or turbidity) is the cause of: 
a.  Filling of lakes and reservoirs. 
b.  Stream turbidity. 
c.  Habitat changes. 
d.  Recreation/aesthetic loss. 
e.  Transport of other contaminants. 
(2)  Nutrients in water (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, organic nitrogen, phosphate, and total phosphorus) are the cause of: 
a.  Algae blooms. 
b.  Eutrophication. 
c.  Ammonia toxicity to aquatic life. 
d.  Nitrate toxicity. 
(3)  Microbes in water (total and fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, viruses, E. coli, Enterococcus) can be the cause of: 
a.  Gastrointestinal diseases. 
b.  Ear/intestinal infections. 
c.  Shellfish bed closure. 
(4)  Organic matter (vegetation, septic tank overflows, pet waste) in water is the cause of: 
a.  Dissolved oxygen depletion. 
b.  Odors. 
c.  Fish kills. 
(5)  Toxic pollutants (heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, organics, hydrocarbons, pesticides/herbicides) can be the cause of: 
a.  Human and aquatic toxicity. 
b.  Bioaccumulation in the food chain. 
c.  Thermal pollution dissolved oxygen depletion. 
d.  Habitat changes. 
e.  Trash and debris. 
f.  Recreation loss. 
g.  Aesthetic loss.

Sec. 14-832. - Construction BMPs. 
(a)  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Construction BMPs fall into two categories, erosion control and sediment control. Erosion control is the protection of the soil surface from the impact of rain drops and the resulting detachment of soil particles. Sediment control are the practices that capture soil particles that have been detached and transported down slope. It is far more efficient and cost effective to prevent erosion than to capture sediment. 
(b)  Design methodology and BMP selection criteria. Construction BMPs are typically designed for erosion control, sediment control, or control of wastes (hazardous, solid, etc.). For the best results, BMPs should be used in series with one or more BMPs. The operator of the construction site should concentrate efforts on erosion control; but provide sediment control backup BMPs. A listing of construction erosion and sediment control BMPs and the benefits each provides is shown in Table 1. Further information on each BMP is presented in the following sections of this article. 
Table 1.
Construction BMP Characteristics Chart

(c)  Construction planning; minimize clearing and compaction. 
(1)  Description. Clearing of natural vegetation and vehicular traffic on the site will expose and compact soils causing erosion and greater amounts of runoff. "Minimization of clearing and compaction" will decrease the amount of soil exposed to erosion and will decrease the amount runoff from due to compacted soil. 
(2)  Applicability. Existing vegetation can often be incorporated into the design and construction of a development lessening the amount of bare soil exposed to rain and wind. Compacted soil does not allow for adequate infiltration of precipitation, therefore increasing runoff quantities and flowrates. Increased flowrates increase erosion and sediment transport. 
(3)  Design criteria. Landscaping and clearing requirements vary from project to project. Vehicular traffic within the construction site should be limited and confined to areas that are protected with adequate sediment control practices. 
(4)  Limitations. Some native plants and grasses are not considered appropriate for developed sites; so, nonnative grasses and plants would need to be planted. 
(5)  Maintenance requirements. Maintenance of protective fencing as needed. 
(d)  Construction sequencing. 
(1)  Description. Exposing soil before required for construction can expose the soil to erosion for an extended period. Construction sequencing coordinates land disturbing activities with construction requirements to minimize the amount of soil exposed to erosion at any time. 
(2)  Applicability. Only land needed for building activities and vehicular traffic should be cleared. Projects on larger sites and on projects that land disturbing activities can be phased are best suited for construction sequencing. 
(3)  Design criteria. Areas of the site to be preserved should be clearly marked on the plans and delineated on the site. The timing of clearing and access to different areas of the site should be indicated in the contract documents. 
(4)  Limitations. Sometimes, smaller projects do not lend themselves to sequencing of land disturbing activities. 
(5)  Maintenance requirements. Maintenance of protective fencing as needed. 
(e)  Runoff and run-on control BMPs. See City of Rogers, Arkansas Drainage Criteria Manual Chapter 8.

Sec. 20-207. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    False alarm means the activation of a fire alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, improper maintenance, or the negligence of the owners or lessee of the fire alarm system or of his employees or agents. This does not include alarms caused by unauthorized tampering with a fire alarm system by anyone other than the fire alarm user or his agent. 
    Fire alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, installed by a fire alarm business, arranged to signal the occurrence of a fire, smoke, water flow or other condition to which the fire department may be expected to respond. 
    Fire alarm user means a person or organization of any kind that is in control of any building, structure, or facility where a fire alarm system is present. 
    Year means a 12-month period beginning with January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year. 
(Ord. No. 09-28, § 1, 4-14-2009; Ord. No. 15-128, § 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 20-208. - Procedure and user fee. 
(a)  Whenever fire department personnel respond to an activated fire alarm system, the fire official in charge of the incident shall determine if the response was caused by a false alarm and shall indicate that fact upon the incident report. 
(b)  The fire department shall regularly review incident reports to monitor the accumulation of false alarms at any one location. When two false alarms have occurred at the same location within one year, and the location is within the incorporated area of the city, the fire department shall notify the fire alarm user by letter, citing the location and date of each false alarm. The letter shall recommend that appropriate action be taken on the part of the fire alarm user to alleviate the causes of false alarms and shall include a statement that an accumulation of more than three false alarms within a year shall result in a charge for services. Another similar letter shall be sent when three false alarms have occurred at the same location within the year. 
(c)  When four false alarms have occurred at one location within a year, a user fee of $100.00 for service for a false alarm response shall be billed to the property owner. Each additional false alarm within the year shall require the billing of an additional $100.00 fee. However, no fire alarm user shall be charged with accumulating more than one false alarm in any 24-hour period. The fee hereby established affords only partial recovery of the expenses incurred in responding to the false alarm. In the event payment of the fee, in full, has not been received within 30 days of billing, the fee shall increase to $300.00. 
(Ord. No. 09-28, § 2, 4-14-2009; Ord. No. 15-128, § 1(Exh. A), 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 20-209. - Evidence of repair accepted in lieu of fee. 
    An alarm user may submit evidence that a malfunctioning system has been repaired in lieu of paying a user fee within ten days of the date of notification of the fee.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 22-20. - Statutory authority. 
    The state legislature has in A.C.A. § 14-268-101 et seq. delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations to minimize flood losses. 
(Code 1997, § 50-131; Ord. No. 07-126, § 1, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-21. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas of the city in the current scientific and engineering report entitled The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Benton County, Arkansas and Incorporated Areas, dated June 5, 2012, with an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM) dated June 5, 2012. 
(b)  These special flood hazard areas were revised by the Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Case Number 12-06-1612P for FIRM panel number 05007C0270K. 
(c)  These special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic flooding events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(d)  These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods into special flood hazard areas. Such structures or uses are inherently hazardous to other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events. 
(Code 1997, § 50-132; Ord. No. 07-126, § 2, 9-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-135, § 1(A), 10-9-2007; Ord. No. 12-19, § 1, 2-14-2012; Ord. No. 12-83, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 22-22. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in identified special flood hazard areas. This article advances the stated purpose through provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Protect natural floodplains against unwise development; 
(3)  Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development; 
(4)  Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects; 
(5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events; 
(7)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(8)  Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base; and 
(9)  Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Code 1997, § 50-133; Ord. No. 07-126, § 3, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-23. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Code 1997, § 50-134; Ord. No. 07-126, § 4, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-24. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    This article uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose: 
(1)  This article restricts or prohibits structures or uses in special flood hazard areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during flooding events; 
(2)  This article requires protection against flood damage for structures or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has occurred; 
(3)  This article controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation and transport of floodwaters; 
(4)  This article controls floodplain development (structural development, placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining, drilling, dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration, drainage improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or sewer installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by increasing flood elevations, floodwater velocities, or flood discharge patterns; and 
(5)  This article regulates the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands. 
(Code 1997, § 50-135; Ord. No. 07-126, § 5, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-25. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Whenever there is a conflict or overlap between this division and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction, the instrument with the more stringent restrictions applies. 
(Code 1997, § 50-137; Ord. No. 07-126, § 7, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-26. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions must: 
(1)  Be considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Be liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Code 1997, § 50-138; Ord. No. 07-126, § 8, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-27. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. Documented scientific and engineering data form the basis for these requirements. On rare occasions, flooding events greater than those considered for this article will occur. In addition, flood heights may increase over time due to manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside special flood hazard areas will be free from flooding, nor that strict adherence to this article protects uses permitted within special flood hazard areas from all flood damages. This article specifically does not create liability on the part of the community, nor any official or employee of the community, for any flood damages that result while strictly following this article, or from any lawful administrative decision made under the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1997, § 50-139; Ord. No. 07-126, § 9, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-28. - Compliance. 
    Constructing, locating, substantially altering or changing the use of any structure or land after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived requires full compliance with the provisions of this article and all other applicable regulations. 
(Code 1997, § 50-140; Ord. No. 07-126, § 10, 9-11-2007) 
Sec. 22-29. - Penalty for noncompliance. 
(a)  Flood hazards are reduced by compliance with the provisions of this Code. Accordingly, enforcement of this division discourages noncompliance and is a recognized mechanism for flood hazard reduction. 
(b)  The floodplain administrator must enforce the provisions of this article and is authorized to: 
(1)  Issue cease and desist orders on noncompliant floodplain development projects; 
(2)  Issue citations for noncompliance; 
(3)  Request that FEMA file a 1316 Action (Denial of Flood Insurance) against noncompliant properties; and 
(4)  Take any other lawful action necessary to prevent or remedy any instance of noncompliance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  It is a misdemeanor to violate or fail to comply with any provision of this article. 
(d)  Any person found, in a court of competent jurisdiction, guilty of violating this article is subject to fines; in addition, the defendant is subject to payment of all associated court costs and costs involved in the case.

DIVISION 2. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CODE 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 22-47. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning (additional definitions for floodplain management terms can be found at 44 CFR 59.1.): 
    44 CFR 59-75 (Emergency Management and Assistance-National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) contain federal regulations upon which local floodplain managements are based. 
    44 CFR 65.12 contains the section of the federal regulations which involves revision of flood insurance rate maps to reflect base flood elevations caused by proposed encroachments. 
    100-year flood is any flood with a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. The term "100-year flood" is misleading because of its statistical derivation. A 100-year flood may occur many times in any given 100-year period, or it may not occur at all in 100 years. 
    500-year flood is any flood with a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year. As with the 100-year flood, this term is also misleading, because of its statistical derivation. A "500-year flood" may occur many times in any given 500-year period, or it may not occur at all in 500 years. 
    Accessory structures means structures which are on the same parcel of property as the principle structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure (such as garages and storage sheds). 
    Adverse impact means any negative or harmful effect. 
    AE risk zones are special flood hazard areas where detailed studies have determined base flood elevations. 
    AH risk zones are special flood hazard areas characterized by shallow flooding with ponding effects (where floodwaters accumulate in depressions and linger until absorbed or evaporated). 
    AO risk zones are special flood hazard areas characterized by shallow flooding with sheet flow (where floodwaters flow in a broad, shallow sheet rather than through a narrow channel). 
    A risk zones are special flood hazard areas without detailed studies, where base flood elevations have not been determined. 
    Appeal board means a person specifically designated to render decisions on variance applications and floodplain management complaints. 
    Automatic entry and exit of floodwaters means that the water must be able to enter and exit with no intervening action from a person. 
    Base flood is the flood profile used as the basis for the NFIP regulations. The federal government has selected the 100-year flood as the base flood. 
    Base flood elevation refers to the expected height of floodwaters during the peak of the base flood event. 
    Basement is any enclosed area that is below grade on all four walls. 
    BFE means base flood elevation. 
    Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by water. Buoyancy can cause underground tanks to float free and can lift structures off foundations. 
    Certificates of compliance are formal documents issued by floodplain administrators certifying that completed projects comply with the requirements of this Code. 
    CFR means the Code of Federal Regulations. The CFR is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation. The federal regulations pertaining to the national Flood Insurance Program are found in title 44, Emergency Management and Assistance. 
    Clearing is the act of cutting timber or shrubs from an area. 
    Commercial business park is typically an area of offices or light industrial usage, although retail, service, or industrial usage is sometimes included in supporting roles. For example, a commercial business park of office complexes may also include restaurants which service these offices. 
    Concrete deadman anchors are heavy steel rods embedded in buried sections of concrete, used to secure items in place under tension. 
    Covenant is a clause in a contract that requires one party to do, or refrain from doing, certain things. A covenant frequently appears as a restriction that a lender imposes on a borrower. 
    Crawlspace is a type of structural foundation where the space beneath the lowest floor is typically not deep enough to allow a person to stand and not all four walls are below grade. 
    Critical facilities include the following: 
(1)  Governmental facilities that are considered essential for the delivery of critical services and crisis management, such as data and communication centers and key governmental complexes; 
(2)  Facilities that are essential for the health and welfare of the whole population, such as hospitals, prisons, police and fire stations, emergency operations centers, evacuation shelters and schools; 
(3)  Mass transportation facilities, such as airports, bus terminals, train terminals; 
(4)  Lifeline utility systems, including potable water, wastewater, oil, natural gas, electric power and communications systems; 
(5)  High potential loss facilities, such as nuclear power plants or military installations;

    Riverine flooding is flooding associated with a river or stream channel. 
    RV is the acronym for recreational vehicle. 
    Screw augers are any type of anchor that twists into the soil, typically to a depth of four feet or more. They are not suitable for securing manufactured homes against floodwaters because saturated grounds often soften and fail to hold the anchor in place. 
    Section 404 wetlands permit is a permit required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act for the discharge of dredged and fill material into any surface water of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues section 404 permits.

    Slab anchors are anchors where the hook of the anchor is wrapped around a horizontal rebar in the slab before the concrete is poured. 
    Special flood hazard areas are geographical areas identified on FEMA flood maps as being at-risk for flooding. The maps further categorize these areas into various flood risk zones A, AE, AH, and AO. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. The term "permanent construction" does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    State coordinating agency is the agency that acts as a liaison between FEMA and a community for the purposes of floodplain management. The state natural resources commission is the state coordinating agency for Arkansas. 
    Stream channels are depressed natural pathways through which water of any quantity routinely flows. 
    Structural development is a development that includes the placement or construction of a structure. 
    Structure, for the purposes of floodplain management, refers to any building with two or more rigid walls and a fully secured roof on a permanent site or to any gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage is damage of any origin where the cost to restore a structure to its original undamaged state would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before any damage occurred. In determining whether substantial damage has occurred, estimators must use standard contractor and materials costs. There are no exceptions for homeowners who make their own repairs or for discounted or free raw materials. 
    Substantial improvement is any reconstruction, remodeling, addition or improvement to a structure with a cost equaling or exceeding 50 percent of the market value of the structure before any improvement. Improvements to correct identified violations of local health, sanitary or safety codes are not substantial improvements, regardless of the cost, as long as they are the minimum improvement necessary to bring the structure up to code. Alterations to historical structures are also exempted, as long as the improvement does not affect the structure's official status of historical structure. 
    Uses vulnerable to floods are simply any land or structural uses that may be negatively affected by a flood. 
    Variance is a formal, written permission from the appeals board to construct or develop in a way that is inconsistent with the requirements of this Code. The variance only deals with this Code; the appeals board has no authority to waive any other governmental requirement, and has no say in the cost of flood insurance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this Code is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse alteration refers to any change that occurs within the banks of a watercourse. 
    X risk zones are a special group of insurance risk zones. One type, shown as nonshaded areas on FEMA issued flood maps, indicates a zone where flooding is not expected to occur. The second type, shown as shaded areas of FEMA flood maps, indicates a flood hazard area that is expected to be affected by the 500-year flood, but not by the 100-year base flood.

The existing structure, as well as any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement, must meet the standards of new construction in this Code. 
(8)  Any improvement to an existing structure that is less than a substantial improvement requires the improvement, but not the existing structure, to be in full compliance with the provisions of this Code. 
(9)  All manufactured homes to be placed within a special flood hazard area on a community's FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. Screw augers or expanding anchors will not satisfy the requirement of this provision. 
(10)  The design or location of electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment for new structures, or for any improvements to an existing structure, must prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during base flood events. 
(11)  The design of all new and replacement water supply systems must minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system during base flood events. 
(12)  The design of all new and replacement sanitary sewage systems must minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system during flooding events, and must prevent sewage discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
(13)  The placement of on-site waste disposal systems must avoid impairment to, or contamination from, the disposal system during base flood events. 
(14)  Construction of basement foundations in any special flood hazard area is prohibited. 
(15)  New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas (such as garages and crawlspaces) below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are below the base flood elevation shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(16)  The placement of recreational vehicles (RV) in special flood hazard areas must either: 
a.  Be temporary, as demonstrated by the RV being fully licensed, being on wheels or a jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, having no permanently attached additions, and being immobile for no more than 180 consecutive days; or 
b.  Meet all provisions of this Code applicable to manufactured home structures. 
(17)  All proposals for the development of a residential subdivision, commercial business park or manufactured home park/subdivision must have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

Sec. 22-106. - Risk zone specific standards. 
    In addition to the general standards, the following standards apply to specific development types in specific risk zones, except as revised in section 22-72. (Risk zones listed in this Code that do not appear on the current FIRM are not applicable.): 
(1)  In AE risk zones, special flood hazard areas with base floods determined: 
a.  For residential structures in zone AE: 
1.  For all new residential structures, the top surface of the lowest floor must have an elevation two feet above the published BFE. This elevation must be documented on an elevation certificate properly completed by a professional engineer, surveyor or architect licensed to practice in the state. 
2.  For all substantial improvements or substantial damage to existing residential structures, the entire structure becomes subject to the requirements of a new residential structure. 
3.  For any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to an existing residential structure that is less than a substantial improvement, only the improved area, but not the entire structure, becomes subject to the requirements of a new residential structure. 
b.  For nonresidential structures in zone AE: 
1.  All new commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structures must either: 
(i)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated two feet above the base flood level; or 
(ii)  Be floodproofed such that, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below an elevation of three feet above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
2.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify on a floodproofing certificate that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
3.  For all substantial improvements or substantial damage to existing commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structures the entire structure becomes subject to the requirements of a new nonresidential structure. 
4.  For any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to an existing nonresidential structure that is less than a substantial improvement, only the improved area, but not the entire structure, becomes subject to the requirements of a new nonresidential structure. 
c.  For manufactured homes in zone AE:

Sec. 24-8. - Demolition. 
(a)  If the application for a certificate of appropriateness involves the demolition of a building which the HDC initially determines to be an inappropriate demolition, then the HDC may defer the matter until such time as it has had an opportunity to consider the following alternatives to the demolition of subject property: 
(1)  Sources of funding for preservation and restoration activities if lack of such funds is the reason for the request to demolish; 
(2)  Adaptive use changes; 
(3)  An attempt to find a purchaser for the property who would maintain the building in a suitable and acceptable manner; 
(4)  The feasibility of moving the building to another appropriate location; 
(5)  Any such other solution as may be deemed advisable and in keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter. 
(b)  The owner or other person having legal custody of any building or structure within a historic district shall keep the structure properly maintained and repaired in order to prevent demolition by neglect. However, during the time the HDC is considering any one of the alternatives above, the HDC and/or its staff at its regularly scheduled meeting shall make progress reports. If, at the expiration of six calendar months from the date of the first public hearing of an application for demolition, the HDC has not found a viable alternative to the demolition of the property, the HDC shall reschedule the matter for public hearing requiring notices as aforesaid, and upon said public hearing, make its final determination as to the application. In such cases, the public hearing for final determination shall be held within one calendar month after the expiration of the six months from the date of the first public hearing; and at the second public hearing, the HDC may hear such matters as are considered necessary or desirable to be fully advised of all facts and circumstances pertaining to the proposed demolition. At the second public hearing, the HDC may immediately announce its decision or take the matter under advisement to its next regularly scheduled meeting but in no event longer than two calendar months after the expiration of the six-month period after the first public hearing. If the HDC has rendered no decision on the application for demolition within two calendar months after the expiration of the six months following the first public hearing, the HDC shall consider the application as having been approved and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
(c)  Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted or construed to supersede or negate the city's authority provided for in chapter 18, article III, to abate a nuisance structure.

Sec. 24-9. - Economic hardship. 
(a)  In addition to considering the matters brought to the attention of the HDC and the criteria set out above, the HDC may determine that failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness will involve a substantial economic hardship to the applicant. 
(b)  It shall be the incumbent on the applicant to demonstrate economic hardship to the HDC. 
(c)  If the property is a significant historic and community resource, the HDC may invoke up to a 90-day delay of proposed work. During this period of delay, the HDC shall propose suitable alternatives to the proposed work for the applicant to investigate. The applicant, with the assistance of the HDC and/or city staff, shall investigate the feasibility of the proposed alternatives, and report their findings to the HDC. If the applicant fails such, the HDC may consider this failure in their deliberations. 
(d)  If, after the end of the 90-day delay period, no reasonable use can be found or economic return can be obtained and there has been no substantial detriment to the historic district, the HDC may issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the HDC finds otherwise, it shall deny the application for certificate of economic hardship, and record in its records the reasons therefore. 
(e)  If the city has not otherwise determined that demolition is required for matters of life, health, safety, or the public's welfare pursuant to City Code, then the HDC may determine if it is more appropriate to issue a certificate of economic hardship or to proceed with demolition.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal occurrence of an illegal entry, or other activity requiring urgent attention to which police are expected to respond. 
    Alarm user means a person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, or organization of any kind that is in control of any building, structure, or facility where an alarm system is present. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, improper maintenance, or the negligence of the owners or lessee of the alarm system or of his employees or agents. The term "false alarm" does not include alarms caused by unauthorized tampering with an alarm system by anyone other than the alarm user or his agent. 
    Year means a 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending December 31. 
(Ord. No. 09-50, § 1, 6-9-2009; Ord. No. 14-48, § 1(Exh. A), 10-14-2014) 
Sec. 26-52. - False alarm procedure and user fee. 
(a)  Whenever police department personnel respond to an activated alarm system, the police official in charge of the incident shall determine if the response was caused by a false alarm and shall indicate that fact upon the incident report. 
(b)  The police department shall regularly review incident reports to monitor the accumulation of false alarms at any one location. When two false alarms have occurred at the same location within one year, the police department shall notify the alarm user by letter, citing the location and date of each false alarm. The letter shall recommend that appropriate action be taken on the part of the alarm user to alleviate the causes of false alarms and shall include a statement that an accumulation of more than three false alarms within a year shall result in a charge for services. Another similar letter shall be sent when three false alarms have occurred at the same location within the year. 
(c)  Civil penalties. All false alarms, as defined in this article, to which the department responds, after the third false alarm in a one-year period, shall result in a civil penalty as set forth in the following schedule: 
(1)  Fourth false alarm from a facility other than a residence within a one-year period, a fine of $50.00 per false alarm response shall be billed to the property owner. Each false alarm call thereafter, up to and including the seventh call, will also be charged $50.00. 
(2)  Eighth false alarm and each false alarm call thereafter from a facility other than a residence within a one-year period, $100.00 per call. 
(3)  Fourth false alarm from a residence within a one-year period, $15.00 per false alarm call and $15.00 per call for each alarm call thereafter, to and including the seventh call: eighth false alarm and each false alarm call thereafter from a residence within a one-year period, $30.00 per call. 
(4)  No alarm user shall be charged with accumulating more than one false alarm in any 24-hour period. Also any alarm user who has had an alarm system installed for less than 60 days shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in this article. 
(5)  Any unpaid invoices at the end of the one-year period shall be paid by February 1 of the following year. Unpaid invoices could result in the suspension of police response to activated alarm systems until such time as the account is settled.

Sec. 26-53. - Evidence of repair accepted in lieu of fee. 
    An alarm user may submit evidence that a malfunctioning system has been repaired in lieu of paying a user fee within ten days of the date of notification of the fee. Evidence such as a receipt from a state-licensed alarm business with a statement of repairs made to the system is acceptable. For a repeated problem with a system after a repair is alleged to have been made, the user fee will still apply. 
(Ord. No. 09-50, § 3, 6-9-2009; Ord. No. 14-48, § 1(Exh. A), 10-14-2014) 
Sec. 26-54. - Review of false alarm charge. 
(a)  Any person may appeal the fee to the police chief. Any and all appeals shall be submitted in writing within ten days of notification of the fee. 
(b)  Suspension of police response. In addition to the penalties set forth in this section, the department shall, upon sending notice of the fourth false alarm in one year, advise the alarm user that the department shall, upon the eighth false alarm in one year, declare that the alarm system constitutes a public nuisance, and police response will be suspended. Upon the eighth false alarm, police response will be suspended, and will be reinitiated only upon receipt of written verification from an alarm business stating that the alarm system is in good working order and that the personnel using that system have been trained in its proper operation. Upon the 12th false alarm within a one-year period, police response shall be suspended for 12 months. The department will notify the alarm user by ordinary mail of any suspension of police response. The suspension of police response is only on response to the activation of an alarm system at issue, and shall not include any situations in which alarm activation is accompanied by other information or verification indicating a need for a police response to that location.

Services will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(Code 1982, § 19-82; Code 1997, § 118-77) 
Sec. 54-84. - Inspections. 
    The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the building inspector's office to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the water utilities shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with state/statutes and regulations, city ordinances and standards relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(Code 1982, § 19-83; Code 1997, § 118-78) 
Sec. 54-85. - Backflow prevention assembly installation. 
    An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
(1)  In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the manager of the water utilities. The public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
(2)  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process water and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
(3)  In the case of premises having internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or having intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line. 
(Code 1982, § 19-84; Code 1997, § 118-79) 
Sec. 54-86. - Degree of hazard determines type of protective assembly. 
    The type of protective assembly required under section 54-85 shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
(1)  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in of section 54-85(1) and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
(2)  In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system shall be protected by an approved double checkvalve assembly. 
(3)  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
(4)  In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection. 
(5)  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises. 
(6)  In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the superintendent or building inspector, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the superintendent or building inspector may require an air gap at the service connection to protect the public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the superintendent or building inspector and is dependent on the degree of hazard. 
(Code 1982, § 19-85; Code 1997, § 118-80)

Local limits may be expressed as numerical values, narrative statements, and/or best management practices. The local limit shall be technically based predicated on the capability of the POTW to receive and to treat the discharge the wastewater load or headworks loading, and to: 
(1)  Prevent interference with the function and efficiency of the treatment processes; 
(2)  Meet the required discharge standards; and 
(3)  Prevent contamination of the POTW sludge, which would prevent disposal, land application or reuse. 
(b)  Technically based local concentration limits (TBLL) shall apply at the point where the industry waste is discharged to the POTW as described in the industrial user permit. 
(c)  All concentrations for metal pollutants shall be for total metal unless otherwise indicated. 
(d)  The control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to or in lieu of the concentration based local limits to protect the POTW and/or prevent prohibited dilution of pollutants. 
(e)  The control authority may develop specific discharge limitations for any other pollutant which the control authority may determine to be of sufficient quantity to cause POTW interference, and/or bypass through, endanger the health and safety of the POTW personnel or public health, cause a POTW permit violation, or render the POTW sludge unacceptable for economic reuse or reclamation. 
(f)  Best management practices may be used in addition to or in lieu of discharge limits or pretreatment requirements. BMPs may be applied when: 
(1)  There is not sufficient flow from a user to obtain a representative wastewater sample; 
(2)  The proposed limit is less than the detection limit and/or the quantification level of the most stringent analytical procedure; and/or 
(3)  The BMP is clearly the most economically feasible method for regulating the pollutant of concern.

(a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

Sec. 54-601. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 118-506. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 54-583, 54-595 and 54-596. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the control authority, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 54-603. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the control authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, sulfides, cyanide, phenol, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

DIVISION 15. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 54-784. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation (40 CFR 403.16(a)). 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the control authority orally within 24 hours and in writing within five days of becoming aware of the upset: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Code 1997, § 118-631; Ord. No. 04-150, § 1, 12-14-2004) 
Sec. 54-785. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the specific prohibitions in sections 54-415(a)(3) through (a)(7) and (b)(9) through (b)(27) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Code 1997, § 118-632; Ord. No. 04-150, § 1, 12-14-2004) 
Sec. 54-786. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Enforcement action. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 2. - ORDINANCE NO. 07-32[3] 
ORDINANCE NO. 07-32 
    AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND CITY CLERK TO INTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE, L.P., A TEXAS LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS AT&T ARKANSAS FOR THE PROVISION OF INTEGRATED INTERNET PROTOCOL ("IP") ENABLED BROADBAND PLATFORM OF VOICE, DATA AND VIDEO SERVICES; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. 
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ROGERS, ARKANSAS: 
AGREEMENT 
    THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") dated April 13, 2007 ("Effective Date") is made by and between Southwestern Bell Telephone, L.P., a Texas limited partnership doing business as AT&T Arkansas ("AT&T Arkansas") and the City of Rogers, Arkansas, a municipal corporation ("City"). AT&T Arkansas and City shall sometimes be referred to separately as a "Party," and collectively as the "Parties." 
RECITALS 
A.  As a telecommunications provider, AT&T Arkansas has statewide authority under Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 to construct, operate and maintain its telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way ("ROW") throughout the state of Arkansas. Under Ark. Code Ann. §14-200-101, the City is permitted to impose reasonable terms and conditions on AT&T Arkansas' use and occupation of the City's ROW and to collect a reasonable franchise fee for such use and occupation of its ROW. 
B.  AT&T Arkansas is in the process of upgrading its existing telecommunications network to provide an integrated Internet Protocol ("IP") enabled broadband platform of voice, data and video services ("IP Network"), the video component of which is a switched, two-way, point-to-point and interactive service ("IP-enabled Video Service"). The IP Network upgrade will involve the use of the City's ROW. 
C.  AT&T Arkansas believes that Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 covers the construction, operation and maintenance of the IP Network, and that AT&T Arkansas is not required to obtain a separate franchise or other authorization from the City to offer IP-enabled services including IP-enabled Video Services within the City over the IP Network. 
D.  AT&T Arkansas further believes that the City's right to regulate the construction of the IP Network in the City's ROW is limited to the right to impose reasonable conditions regarding the time, place, and manner of AT&T Arkansas' use and occupation of the City's ROW. 
E.  City believes that the provision of IP-enabled Video Services by AT&T Arkansas is beyond the scope of Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 and is subject to the City's cable television franchising authority. 
F.  Both Parties agree that the deployment of the IP Network and the provision of IP-enabled Video Services should not be delayed by litigation to establish the scope of Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 or the application of the City's franchise ordinance to IP-enabled Video Services. 
G.  City and AT&T Arkansas further agree that litigation to resolve this issue would be complex and protracted, and that it is in the best interests of both Parties and the residents of the City to reach a compromise of each other's positions and claims. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and reliance upon the respective representations, promises, concessions, terms and conditions contained herein, City and AT&T Arkansas agree as follows.

Should the finding be final, non-appealable and binding upon either City or AT&T, this Agreement shall be deemed modified or limited to the extent necessary to address the subject of the finding unless either party, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the ruling, provides written notice to the other party of election to terminate, in which case this Agreement shall terminate within six (6) months or such earlier period as the parties mutually may agree. Where the effect of a finding is a modification, the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations to modify this Agreement in the manner which best effectuates its overall purposes and the intentions of the parties.

    During the term of this Agreement, AT&T Arkansas shall pay to the City a fee of up to 3% of the gross revenues from subscription fees collected from each subscriber to AT&T Arkansas' IP-enabled Video Services product delivered over the IP Network in the City's rights of way; such product to be defined by AT&T Arkansas when it is offered to the public. The fee does not apply to non-video revenues or the non-video revenues of a bundled product containing video and non-video offerings. The fee will be forwarded to the City quarterly on the last of each quarter. 
Sec. 4. - Public, educational and governmental programming. 
    To the extent economically and technically feasible, AT&T Arkansas shall provide some form of access for the City's noncommercial, public, education and governmental ("PEG") programming through AT&T Arkansas' IP-enabled Video Services.

(a)  City agrees to subject the construction and installation of the IP Network to the same process and review as it subjects the installation and construction of AT&T Arkansas' existing telecommunications infrastructure. 
(b)  City agrees not to unreasonably block, restrict, or limit the construction and installation of the IP Network. 
(c)  City agrees to process any and all applicable permits for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, removal, and other activities associated with the IP Network in a timely and prompt manner. 
Sec. 9. - Indemnification. 
(a)  AT&T Arkansas agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless City, its officers, agents, and employees, from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from tangible property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), to the extent proximately caused by AT&T Arkansas' negligent construction, operation, or maintenance of its IP Network, provided that City shall give AT&T Arkansas written notice of its obligation to indemnify City within ten (10) days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AT&T Arkansas shall not indemnify City for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of City, its officers, agents, employees, attorneys, consultants, independent contractors or third parties or for any activity or function conducted by any person or entity other than AT&T Arkansas in connection with PEG programming. 
(b)  With respect to AT&T Arkansas' indemnity obligations set forth above, AT&T Arkansas shall provide the defense of any claims brought against City by selecting counsel of AT&T Arkansas' choice to defend the claim, subject to the consent of City, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent City from cooperating with AT&T Arkansas and participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel at its own cost and expense, provided, however, that after consultation with City, AT&T Arkansas shall have the right to defend, settle or compromise any claim or action arising hereunder, and AT&T Arkansas shall have the authority to decide the appropriateness and the amount of any such settlement. In the event that the terms of any such settlement do not include the release of City and City does not consent to the terms of any such settlement or compromise, AT&T Arkansas shall not settle the claim or action, but its obligation to indemnify City shall in no event exceed the amount of such settlement. 
(c)  City shall hold AT&T Arkansas harmless and shall be responsible for damages, liability or claims resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of City.

(c)  Nothing herein contained shall be construed as granting to grantee any exclusive right or privilege, nor shall it affect any prior or existing rights of grantee to maintain a telecommunication system within the City of Rogers, Arkansas. 
Sec. 2. - Definitions and construction. 
    [For the purposes of this division:] 
    Telecommunication business or system shall mean a system of telecommunication cables, wires, transformers, poles, conduits, fixtures and appurtenances thereto, constructed for the purpose of supplying and distributing telecommunications services (including all information, voice, data and video services) and for other purposes. 
    Grantee shall be construed to mean the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, or its successors, lessees, and assigns, the franchisee under this ordinance. 
    Public way shall be defined as including streets, avenues, alleys, roads, highways, rights-of-way, public (non-utility) easements and other public places and ways within the jurisdiction of the city. 
    Public ground shall be defined as city parks and other public places within the jurisdiction of the city. 
Sec. 3. - Location, other regulations. 
(a)  Location of facilities. Telecommunication Facilities shall be located, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over public ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any city utility system previously installed therein. Telecommunication facilities shall be located on public grounds as reasonably determined by the city. Grantee's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of telecommunication facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the city to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement. Grantee may abandon underground telecommunication facilities in place, provided at the city's request, grantee will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased conduit interfering with a city improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is uncovered by excavation as part of the city improvement project. 
(b)  Field locations. Grantee shall provide horizontal field locations for its underground telecommunication distribution facilities within the city within 48 hours of a formal request by the city. If vertical field locations are requested, grantee shall provide the information within 14 days. 
(c)  Street openings. Grantee shall not open or disturb any public way or public ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the city, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the city may require a surety bond posted at the beginning of each calendar year. Permit conditions imposed on grantee shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Grantee may, however, open and disturb any public way or public ground without permission from the city where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of telecommunication facilities. In such event grantee shall notify the city by telephone to the office designated by the city as soon as practicable. Not later than the second working day thereafter, grantee shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees. 
(d)  Restoration. After completing any work requiring the opening of any public way or public ground, grantee shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter. Work outside the paved area must be fine graded and seeded, hydro-mulch, or sod placed so that adjacent property owners or the city can mow without damage to machinery or people. The restoration work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if grantee shall not promptly perform and complete the restoration work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the public way or public ground in the said condition, the city shall have, after demand to grantee to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, the right to make the restoration at the expense of grantee. Grantee shall pay to the city the cost of such work done for or performed by the city. The remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the city for noncompliance. 
(e)  Notice of improvements. The city must give grantee reasonable notice of plans for improvements to public ways or public ground where the city has reason to believe that telecommunication facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain: (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the public ways and public ground upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the city will start the work, and (v) if more than one public way or public ground is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The notice must give grantee a sufficient length of time in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit grantee to make any necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its telecommunication facilities. 
    Utilities shall be required to submit any large project or new expansion inside the city within that calendar year. 
(f)  Utility corridors. The city will provide grantee space within a utility corridor in which to locate on all major street projects. Grantee must locate within the assigned area of the corridor so as to not interfere with other utilities. Any utility that locates outside their assigned area in the corridor will be required to move into their assigned location or the city may move the utility and charge the utility for the relocation. 
Sec. 4. - Relocations. 
(a)  Relocation of telecommunication facilities in public ways. 
(i)  If at the city's cost the city determines to vacate a public way for a city improvement project, or, to grade, regrade, or change the line of any public way, or construct or reconstruct any city utility system in any public way, it may order grantee to relocate its telecommunication facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the city's proposed public improvement. 
(ii)  If such project is performed by the city at the city's cost, grantee shall relocate its telecommunication facilities at its own expense unless they are in a private easement or right-of-way obtained by the grantee, property owned by the grantee, or by agreement between the parties. If they are in an easement obtained by the city or as part of a city project the grantee must relocate at their own expense. 
(iii)  The city shall give grantee reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a city improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any public way or to construct or reconstruct any city utility system. If relocation is ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same telecommunication facilities, which was made at grantees expense, the city shall reimburse grantee for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a city utility system to a previously unserved area, grantee may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense subject to provisions (a) (i) and (ii) above. 
(iv)  Nothing in this ordinance requires grantee to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its telecommunication facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the city or any third party, including but not limited to any project for the benefit of a private development, and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a public way or city utility system or other city improvement. 
(b)  Relocation of telecommunication facilities in public ground. City may require grantee at grantee's expense to relocate or remove its telecommunication facilities from public ground upon finding by city that the telecommunication facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the public ground. 
Sec. 5. - Moving of buildings. 
    The telecommunication company on the request of any person shall remove or raise or lower its wires temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering or wires shall be paid by the party of parties requesting the same and the telecommunication company may require such payment in advance. The telecommunication company shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
Sec. 6. - Rates. 
    The telecommunication company shall pay to the city for the period January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010, inclusive and thereafter for like periods the sum of $44,595.00. Said sum is to be paid in equal monthly payments on the 15th day of each month covering the preceding calendar month, the first payment being due on February 15, 2010. This payment is in lieu of any and all other licenses, charges, fees, or impositions which may be conferred by the city under authority conferred by law. 
Sec. 7. - Term. 
    This agreement shall become effective January 1, 2010. Either part hereto may move for adjustment of the municipal franchise fee or other terms of this franchise by giving notice in writing of the intention to terminate 60 days prior to the end of any calendar year. Notice of termination shall have no affect upon the perpetual franchise of grantee to operate a telecommunications system within the confines of the City of Rogers, provided that terms of the agreement, rules and regulations of operating and municipal franchise fee shall be modifiable on an annual basis. 
Sec. 8. - Municipal franchise adjustment. 
    The city shall have the right to examine and verify from the records of grantee, any data relating to the gross revenues of sales subject to the municipal franchise fee. 
    Grantee shall not be required to provide any service to the City of Rogers free of charge. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to require or permit any telephone service by the city or for the city. If such telephone service is desired by the city, then a separate noncontingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such attachment. 
Sec. 9. - Police power of city. 
    No provision of this ordinance or franchise shall be construed to limit or abridge the authority of the city to implement and exercise police powers and regulations necessary for the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Rogers, Arkansas. 
Sec. 10. - Indemnity. 
    Grantee shall save and hold harmless the city from any and all claims for damage for which the city may become liable, as well as any costs incurred by defense of such claims by reason of the granting of this franchise, or any act or omission of grantee in the conduct of its operations under this franchise. 
Sec. 11. - Conflicting ordinances repealed. 
    All ordinances or parts of ordinances conflicting with any of the provisions of this ordinance are hereby repealed. If any clause, sentence, or section of this ordinance should be determined to be invalid, the invalidity of any clause, sentence, or section hereof shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance. 
Sec. 12. - Emergency clause. 
    The city council for the City of Rogers, Arkansas, has determined that an emergency exists and this ordinance being necessary for the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Rogers, Arkansas, shall become law immediately upon its passage, approval and publication. 
DIVISION 4. - ORDINANCE NO. 11-94[5] 
ORDINANCE NO. 11-94 
    AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND CITY CLERK TO RENEW THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH AT&T U-VERSE; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. 
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ROGERS, ARKANSAS: 
AGREEMENT 
    THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), dated September 27, 2011, and effective January 1, 2012 ("Effective Date") is made by and between Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, a Missouri Corporation doing business as AT&T Arkansas ("AT&T Arkansas"), and the City of Rogers, Arkansas, a municipal corporation ("City"). AT&T Arkansas and City shall sometimes be referred to separately as a "Party," and collectively as the "Parties." 
RECITALS 
A.  As a telecommunications provider, AT&T Arkansas has statewide authority under Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 to construct, operate and maintain its telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way ("ROW") throughout the state of Arkansas. Under Ark. Code Ann. §14-200-101, the City is permitted to impose reasonable terms and conditions on AT&T Arkansas' use and occupation of the City's ROW and to collect a reasonable franchise fee for such use and occupation of its ROW. 
B.  AT&T Arkansas is in the process of upgrading its existing telecommunications network to provide an integrated Internet Protocol ("IP") enabled broadband platform of voice, data and video services ("IP Network"), the video component of which is a switched, two-way, point-to-point and interactive service ("IP-enabled Video Service"). The IP Network upgrade will involve the use of the City's ROW. 
C.  AT&T Arkansas believes that Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 covers the construction, operation and maintenance of the IP Network, and that AT&T Arkansas is not required to obtain a separate franchise or other authorization from the City to offer IP-enabled services including IP-enabled Video Services within the City over the IP Network. 
D.  AT&T Arkansas further believes that the City's right to regulate the construction of the IP Network in the City's ROW is limited to the right to impose reasonable conditions regarding the time, place, and manner of AT&T Arkansas' use and occupation of the City's ROW. 
E.  City believes that the provision of IP-enabled Video Services by AT&T Arkansas may be beyond the scope of Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 and may be subject to the City's cable television franchising authority. 
F.  Both Parties agree that the deployment of the IP Network and the provision of IP-enabled Video Services should not be delayed by litigation to establish the scope of Ark. Code Ann. §23-17-101 or the application of the City's franchise ordinance to IP-enabled Video Services. 
G.  City and AT&T Arkansas further agree that litigation to resolve this issue would be complex and protracted, and that it is in the best interests of both Parties and the residents of the City to reach a compromise of each other's positions and claims. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and reliance upon the respective representations, promises, concessions, terms and conditions contained herein, City and AT&T Arkansas agree as follows.

(b)  City agrees not to unreasonably block, restrict, or limit the construction and installation of the IP Network. 
(c)  City agrees to process any and all applicable permits for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, removal, and other activities associated with the IP Network in a timely and prompt manner. 
Sec. 9. - Indemnification.

    Where the condition to be waived is a material part of the agreement such that its waiver would affect the essential bargain of the parties, the waiver must be supported by consideration and take the form of a written modification of this agreement, made as provided for elsewhere in this agreement.

(b)  Routes and schedules for collections. The contractor shall provide the city with maps and schedules of collection routes and keep such information current at all times. In the event of changes in the routes or schedules that will alter the day of pickup, the contractor shall promptly notify each customer affected within five days. Any changes in routes and/or schedules are subject to the city's approval, which will not be withheld unreasonably. The contractor shall plan all routes on public or private rights-of-way other than alleys.

There shall be eight (8) "front-line" trucks (7 "side-load" and 1 "rear-load") and four (4) "spare" trucks (3 "side-load" and 1 "rear-load") maintained as a part of this "fleet."

Each truck shall bear, as a minimum, evidence of licensure from the Benton County Solid Waste Management District, and the name and telephone number of the contractor plainly visible. All containers and equipment shall bear the name and telephone number of the contractor and the information shall be as visible to the public as reasonably possible.

If contractor requires assistance from the city in mitigating a spill event mentioned above, contractor agrees to reimburse the city for any material, equipment, and labor used to mitigate said spill. All vehicles shall be sufficiently secure so as to prevent any littering of solid waste and/or leakage of liquid. No vehicles shall be willfully overloaded. In addition, each truck shall be equipped with a flare, fire extinguisher, first-aid kit, and a list of emergency telephone numbers. Failure to maintain equipment shall be considered a breach of this agreement. 
(4)  Contractor shall provide trucks equipped with mechanical arms and hydraulic lifts necessary to provide automated emptying of container bins placed at curbside by homeowners, which is intended to eliminate the handling of bags and garbage cans by human hands; thereby resulting in less spilled refuse and littering. 
(h)  Disposal site. All solid wastes collected pursuant to this agreement shall be transferred by the contractor either directly, or via a state or federal permitted transfer station, to a licensed Subtitle D landfill operation. Contractor shall maintain written agreements with at least two (2) alternative disposal sites or transfer stations that maintain a hard surface disposal area so that solid waste removal and recycle services will not be interrupted during inclement weather due to ground conditions at the landfill.

Where public funds are made available to reimburse utilities or other occupants of the public ways for relocation costs, grantee shall have equal right to apply for and access such funds.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the gas franchise agreement adopted by the City of Rogers, Arkansas, on June 22, 2010. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Sec. 1. - Grant of authority. 
(a)  The City of Rogers, Arkansas, hereby grants to the Arkansas Western Gas Company, and to its successors, lessees and assigns, the exclusive right, privilege and authority within the present and all future expansions of the corporate limits of the City of Rogers. 
(i)  To sell, furnish, transmit and distribute natural gas to all inhabitants and consumers within the corporate limits; and

Sec. 2. - Definitions and construction. 
    For the purposes of this division: 
    Gas distribution system shall mean a system of gas mains, pipes, conduits, feeders, connections, fixtures and appurtenances thereto constructed for the purpose of supplying and distributing natural gas for light, fuel, power, and heat and for other purposes. 
    Grantee shall be construed to mean the Arkansas Western Gas Company or its successors, lessees, and assigns, the franchisee under this ordinance. 
    Natural gas and gas shall be defined as including, in addition to natural gas, such alternate substitutes or supplemental fuels, including but not limited to liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, synthetic natural gas, and propane - air.

    Public ground shall be defined as city parks and other public places within the jurisdiction of the city. 
Sec. 3. - Location, other regulations. 
(a)  Location of facilities. Natural gas distribution systems shall be located, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over public ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any city utility system previously installed therein. Natural gas systems shall be located on public grounds as reasonably determined by the city. Grantee's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of natural gas distribution facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the city to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement. Grantee may abandon underground natural gas distribution facilities in place, provided at the city's request, grantee will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased conduit interfering with a city improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is uncovered by excavation as part of the city improvement project. 
(b)  Field locations. Grantee shall provide horizontal field locations for its underground utility distribution facilities within the city within 48 hours of a formal request by the city. If vertical field locations are requested, grantee shall provide the information within 14 days. 
(c)  Street openings. Grantee shall not open or disturb any public way or public ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the city, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the city may require a surety bond. Permit conditions imposed on grantee shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Grantee may, however, open and disturb any public way or public ground without permission from the city where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of natural gas distribution facilities. In such event grantee shall notify the city by telephone to the office designated by the city as soon as practicable. Not later than the second working day thereafter, grantee shall obtain any required permits. 
(d)  Restoration. After completing any work requiring the opening of any public way or public ground, grantee shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter. Work outside the paved area must be fine graded and seeded, hydro-mulch, or sod placed so that adjacent property owners or the city can mow without damage to machinery or people. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if grantee shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the public way or public ground in the said condition, the city shall have, after demand to grantee to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of grantee.

(e)  Notice of improvements. The city must give grantee reasonable notice of plans for improvements to public ways or public ground where the city has reason to believe that natural gas distribution facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain; (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the public ways and public ground upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the city will start the work, and (v) if more than one public way or public ground is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed.

    Grantee shall be required to submit any large project or new expansion. Grantee will be required to submit to the city a copy of their long range plan on the 1st of each calendar year along with a work schedule inside the city within that calendar year. 
(f)  Utility corridors. The city will provide grantee space within a utility corridor in which to locate on all major street projects. Grantee must locate within the assigned area of the corridor so as to not interfere with other utilities. Any utility that locates outside the corridor will be required to move into their assigned location or the city may move the utility and charge the utility for the relocation. 
Sec. 4. - Relocations. 
(a)  Relocation of natural gas distribution facilities in public ways. If the city determines to vacate a public way for a city improvement project, or at city's cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of any public way, or construct or reconstruct any city utility system in any public way, it may order grantee to relocate its natural gas distribution facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the city's proposed public improvement. Grantee shall relocate its natural gas distribution facilities at its own expense unless they are in a private easement or right-of-way obtained by the grantee. If they are in an easement obtained by the city or as part of a city project the grantee must relocate at their own expense. The city shall give grantee reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a city improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any public way or to construct or reconstruct any city utility system. If relocation is ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same natural gas distribution facilities, which was made at grantee expense, the city shall reimburse grantee for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a city utility system to a previously unserved area, grantee may be require to make the subsequent relocation at its expense. Nothing in this ordinance requires grantee to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its natural gas distribution facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the city and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a public way or city utility system or other city improvement. 
(b)  Relocation of natural gas distribution facilities in public ground. City may require grantee at grantee's expense to relocate or remove its gas distribution facilities from public ground upon finding by city that the natural gas distribution facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the public ground. 
Sec. 5. - Rates. 
    Grantee shall pay to the city a municipal franchisee fee in an amount equal to two percent of grantee's annual gross revenues, including fuel adjustment charges, before taxes, derived from sales of natural gas to residential and commercial consumers, and one percent of grantee's gross revenues, including fuel adjustment charges, before taxes, derived from sales of natural gas to industrial consumers located within the corporate limits. 
    Payments shall be made to the city in monthly installments payable within 30 days following conclusion of the month for which payment is made. 
    Residential, commercial, and industrial revenues are those revenues so classified pursuant to grantee's uniform classification standards. Further: 
(i)  The city shall have the right to examine and verify from the records of the grantee any data relating to the gross revenues of sales subject to the municipal franchise fee; and 
(ii)  Any dispute between the city and the grantee as to the amount of gross revenue subject to the municipal franchise fee or as to the classification of revenue shall be referred to the Arkansas Public Service Commission or its successors, which determination shall be binding upon both parties hereto; and 
(iii)  The franchise fee herein provided for shall be referred to as the municipal franchise adjustment fee (MFAF) for all purposes. 
Sec. 6. - Term. 
    The municipal franchise fee shall become payable with the January 1, 2010 billing for natural gas service. Either party hereto may move for adjustment of the municipal franchise fee or other terms of this agreement by giving notice in writing of intention to terminate 60 days prior to the end of any calendar year. Notice of termination shall have no affect upon the perpetual franchise of the grantee to operate a gas distribution system within the confines of the City of Rogers, provided that terms of the agreement, rules and regulations of operation and municipal franchise fee shall be modifiable on an annual basis. 
Sec. 7. - Police power of city. 
    No provision of this ordinance or franchise shall be construed to limit or abridge the authority of the city to implement and exercise police powers and regulations necessary for the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Rogers, Arkansas.

    Grantee shall save and hold harmless the city from any and all claims for damage for which the city may become liable, as well as any costs incurred by defense of such claims by reason of the granting of this franchise, or any act or omission of grantee in the conduct of its operations. 
Sec. 9. - Conflicting ordinances repealed. 
    All ordinances or parts of ordinances conflicting with any of the provisions of this ordinance are hereby repealed. If any clause, sentence, or section of this ordinance should be determined to be invalid, the invalidity of any clause, sentence, or section hereof shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance. 
Sec. 10. - Emergency clause.
